The Tejano Music Awards were first awarded in 1981 and was established to recognize the most talented performers of Tejano music—a subgenre of regional Mexican music. The nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors and disc jockeys of Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Originally, winners were chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames. By 1987, the award ceremony was broadcast through 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The awards ceremony were originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then to the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe award was first presented to Lisa Lopez for two consecutive years. Lopez was credited to have become the first female Tejano singer to have a number one single on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart in 1982. Tejano music's \"first leading lady\", Laura Canales won the award for four consecutive times. The \"Queen of Tejano music\" Selena, dominated the awards for nine consecutive years and dominated the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year for much of the 1990s decade. In 1997, Jennifer Peña won the award, the first time since 1988 that a new recipient won. Pena dominated the award until Elida Reyna won in 2000; she became the second participant to only win the award once, behind Patsy Torres' win in 1987. In 2002, Shelly Lares won for the first time since she was nominated in 1990. Lares won the award three more times until the honor was disestablished following the 2006 Tejano Music Awards along with the Tejano Music Award for Male Entertainer of the Year and were merged into the Tejano Music Award for Entertainer of the Year beginning at the 2007 awards ceremony.\n\nWinners and nominees\nListed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n\n List of music awards honoring women\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nOfficial site of the Tejano Music Awards\n\nFemale Entertainer of the Yearet\nMusic awards honoring women\nAwards established in 1981\nAwards disestablished in 2006", "machine_text": " The Tejano Music Award for Female Entertainer of the Year is an annual award given to female Mexican/American Texas artists for their outstanding work in Tejano music.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"8 Women\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "8 Women () is a 2002 dark comedy musical film written and directed by François Ozon. Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas, it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Béart, Fanny Ardant, Virginie Ledoyen, Danielle Darrieux, Ludivine Sagnier and Firmine Richard. Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s, the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated, snowbound cottage only to find Marcel, the family patriarch, dead with a knife in his back. Trapped in the house, every woman becomes a suspect, each having her own motive and secret.\n\nOzon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor's film The Women (1939), but eventually settled on Thomas's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so. Drawing inspiration from Cukor's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as Douglas Sirk, Vincente Minnelli, and Alfred Hitchcock, 8 Women blends farce, melodrama, musical, and murder-mystery film while addressing murder, greed, adultery, and homosexuality. Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house, the film recreates much of the play's original theatrical feel. It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the history of film and the actresses' filmographies.\n\nThe film's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in Paris, where filming had taken place. 8 Women competed for the Golden Bear at the 52nd Berlin International Film Festival, where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution. Released to generally positive reviews, with major praise for the stars, the film was nominated for twelve César Awards, including Best Film. At the 2002 European Film Awards, the film was nominated for six awards, including Best Film and Best Director; it won for Best Actress for the eight principal actresses. It was also selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 75th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.\n\nPlot\nThe film is set in the 1950s in a large country residence as a family and its servants are preparing for Christmas. When the master of the house is discovered dead in his bed with a dagger in his back, it is presumed that the murderer must be one of the eight women in the house. Over the course of the investigation, each woman has a tale to tell and secrets to hide.\n\nThe film opens with Suzon returning from school for Christmas break, finding her mother Gaby, her younger sister Catherine, and her wheelchair-bound grandmother Mamy in the living room, where most of the action of the film takes place. Their conversation drifts to the subject of the patriarch of the family, Marcel, and Catherine leads the first song of the film, \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (roughly, \"Dad, you're out of touch\"). The singing wakes up Suzon and Catherine's aunt Augustine, who initiates arguments with the rest of the family and the two servants (Madame Chanel and Louise), eventually returning upstairs and threatening to commit suicide. Mamy jumps out of her wheelchair trying to stop her, haphazardly explaining her ability to walk as a \"Christmas miracle.\" Augustine is eventually calmed down, and she sings her song of longing, \"Message personnel\" (Personal Message).\n\nThe maid takes a tray upstairs, finds Marcel's stabbed body, and screams. Catherine goes up to see what has happened and locks the door. The others finally go up to Marcel's room to see him stabbed in the back. Catherine tells the others that they should not disturb the room until the police arrive, so they re-lock the door. Realizing that the dogs did not bark the night before the incident, it becomes clear that the murderer was known to the dogs and therefore must be one of the women in the house. Attempting to call the authorities, they find that the telephone line has been cut, so they will have to go in person to the police station. Before they can do so, the women are distracted by the announcement that someone is roaming the garden, someone whom the guard dogs are not chasing. The person turns out to be Marcel's sister Pierrette, a nightclub singer who is also rumored to be a prostitute, and who has not been allowed into the house before due to Gaby's dislike for her. When questioned, she claims that she received a mysterious telephone call in which she was informed that her brother was dead. She sings \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (What's the point of living free?), commenting on her sexual freedom.\n\nIt is realized that she has been to the house before, as the dogs did not bark and she knew immediately which room belonged to her brother, making her the eighth potential killer. The women try to start the car, and find that it has been sabotaged, cutting them off from help until the storm subsides and they can hitchhike to town. The women spend their time trying to identify the murderer amongst them. It is learned that Suzon returned the night before to tell her father in secret that she was pregnant. She sings a song to Catherine, \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\"), about her lover; however, she was sexually abused by her father. We later learn that Suzon is not Marcel's child but is the child of Gaby's first great love who was killed not long after the child was conceived; every time Gaby looks at Suzon she is reminded of her love for him.\n\nSuspicion then swings to Madame Chanel, the housekeeper, whose actions the night before seem suspicious. It is revealed that she had been having an affair with Pierrette, who went to see her brother that night to ask for money to pay off her debts. When some members of the family react in outrage to the fact that she is a lesbian, Madame Chanel retreats to the kitchen, and sings \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (So as to not live alone).\n\nIn the meantime we find out that Mamy, Suzon and Catherine's \"old and sick\" grandmother, not only can walk but also possesses some valuable stock shares that could have saved Marcel from his bankruptcy. Out of greed, she lied that her shares had been stolen by someone who knew where she was hiding them. The spotlight moves to Louise, the new maid, who is found out to be Marcel's mistress. She declares affection for Gaby, but also expresses disappointment in her for her weakness and indecision. She sings \"Pile ou face\" (literally \"Heads or Tails\", but referring to the ups and downs of life), and removes the symbols of her servitude, her maid's cap and apron, asserting herself as an equal to the other women. Gaby sings \"Toi Jamais\" (Never You), about Marcel, saying that he never paid enough attention to her, while other men did. It is revealed that she had an affair with Marcel's business partner, Jacques Farneaux, the same man who has been having an affair with Pierrette. The two women get into a fight that turns into a passionate make-out session on the living room floor, a scene which the others walk in on and are stunned by.\n\nEventually, Madame Chanel discovers the solution to the mystery, but she is silenced by a gunshot. While not struck by the bullet, she becomes mute out of shock. Catherine takes the lead, revealing that she hid in her father's closet from where she saw all the other women talk to Marcel the night before. She explains the mystery: Marcel faked his own death, with her help, to see what was really going on in his house. She says that he is now free of the other women's clutches and rushes to his bedroom only to witness Marcel shoot himself in the head. Mamy closes the film with the song \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (There is no happy love) as the women clasp hands and face the audience.\n\nCast\n Danielle Darrieux as Mamy, the matriarch\n Isabelle Huppert as Augustine, her tachycardiac daughter\n Catherine Deneuve as Gaby, her other daughter, the victim's wife\n Fanny Ardant as Pierrette, the victim's sister\n Emmanuelle Béart as Louise, the new chambermaid\n Virginie Ledoyen as Suzon, the victim's elder daughter\n Ludivine Sagnier as Catherine, the victim's younger daughter\n Firmine Richard as Madame Chanel, the cook\n Dominique Lamure as Marcel, the victim, Gaby's husband\n Romy Schneider as the chambermaid's previous mistress (the photograph)\n\nMusical numbers\n \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (\"Dad, You're Out of Touch\") - Catherine and Company\n \"Message personnel\" (\"Personal Message\") - Augustine\n \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (\"What's the Point of Living Free?\") - Pierrette\n \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\") - Suzon\n \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (\"So as Not to Live Alone\") - Madame Chanel\n \"Pile ou face\" (\"Heads or Tails / Ups and Downs\") - Louise\n \"Toi jamais\" (\"Never You\") - Gaby\n \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (\"There is No Happy Love\") - Mamy\n\nProduction\nOzon was inspired by the 1950s Ross Hunter productions of Douglas Sirk and Alfred Hitchcock. To achieve the look of the latter two director's films, Ozon had costume designer Pascaline Chavanne fashion an original costume for each character. Chavanne was inspired by Dior's New Look and the earlier film costumes of Edith Head. Composer Krishna Levy also provided an instrumental score evocative of Bernard Herrmann, with touches of Miklós Rózsa and Elmer Bernstein, as well as a soundtrack featuring eight songs performed unexpectedly by the film's title characters.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\n8 Women received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 124 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. Its consensus states \"Featuring some of the best French actresses working today, 8 Women is frothy, delirious, over-the-top fun.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 64/100 rating, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJonathan Curiel of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that 8 Women was \"a movie that is so original, so funny, so alive with drama, intrigue, mystery and colors that you want to see it again and again\", citing it the \"new masterpiece\" in Ozon's filmography. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave 8 Women three out of four stars. He noted that the film \"is in no sense serious about murder, its plot, or anything else. It's an elaborate excuse to have fun with its cast,\" adding: \"Watching 8 Women, you have a silly grin half of the time.\" He concluded that \"Movies like 8 Women are essentially made for movie-lovers. You have to have seen overdecorated studio musicals, and you have to know who Darrieux and Deneuve and Beart and Huppert and Ardant are, to get the full flavor.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly felt that \"what does matter is that a phalanx of France's most famous actresses play a gay peekaboo with their own images in the guise of replicating a '50s technicolored production. The result is weightless entertainment that's both camp and true, a warped adoration of star-quality actresses as amazing creatures who can project the lives of fictional characters as well as the essence of their own fabulous selves. Hollywood, start your remake.\"\n\nThe Washington Post writer Ann Hornaday called the film \"a gorgeous, if disjointed, spectacle, made endurable—if not entirely comprehensible—by its eye-popping cast.\" She found that the picture \"retains a stagy quality of heightened theatricality\" and that \"with its bold, luxurious palette and hard-candy surfaces, the film seems less photographed than forged out of silk and nail lacquer.\" Rolling Stones Peter Travers concurred: \"All eight women are something to see and marvel at. Whatever you call this one-of-a-kind bonbon spiked with wit and malice, it's classic oo-la-la.\" He rated the comedy three out of four stars. A. O. Scott from The New York Times said, \"The high-minded critical term of art for such a decadent delight is 'guilty pleasure,' but a movie like this reveals that stuffy phrase to be both a redundancy and an oxymoron. 8 Women is indefensible, cynical, even grotesque; it is also pure—that is to say innocent and uncorrupted—fun.\" Less enthusiastic with the film, Salon.com wrote that \"despite the all-star cast of beautiful, talented actresses, this French whodunit never lives up to the grand musicals it rips off.\"\n\nSpecific performances were cited for acclaim. Huppert's portrayal of Augustine was met with praise. Curiel wrote that \"Huppert's song and dance—and her whole performance in the movie—is a study in determination. Huppert has a reputation for her intense portrayals, and in 8 Women, she steals every scene she's in as the uptight, melodramatic, bespectacled aunt.\" Ardant also received praise for her performance with Hornaday saying that \"the showstopper is Ardant, who in a sensational turn combining the earthiness of Ava Gardner and the fire of Rita Hayworth, explodes with an elemental force all her own. Ardant alone is worth the price of admission to 8 Women.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film was released on 6 February 2002 in France and opened at #3 in 493 theaters, grossing $5,246,358 in the opening weekend. It grossed $18,991,866 in the domestic market. The film's international gross was in total $42,426,583.\n\nAccolades\n\nSee also\n Isabelle Huppert on screen and stage\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n \n\n2002 films\n2002 black comedy films\n2002 independent films\n2002 LGBT-related films\n2000s Christmas comedy films\n2000s comedy mystery films\n2000s musical comedy films\nFilms about dysfunctional families\nFilms directed by François Ozon\nFilms featuring an all-female cast\nFilms set in country houses\nFilms set in the 1950s\nFilms shot in France\nFilms whose director won the Best Director Lumières Award\nFrench black comedy films\nFrench Christmas comedy films\nFrench comedy mystery films\nFrench films\nFrench films based on plays\nFrench independent films\n2000s French-language films\nFrench LGBT-related films\nFrench musical comedy films\nItalian black comedy films\nItalian Christmas comedy films\nItalian comedy mystery films\nItalian films\nItalian films based on plays\nItalian independent films\nItalian LGBT-related films\nItalian musical comedy films\nJukebox musical films\nLesbian-related films\nLGBT-related black comedy films\nLGBT-related musical comedy films\nLGBT-related Christmas films\nMurder mystery films\nSilver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution", "machine_text": " 8 Women is a 2002 French dark comedy musical film written and directed by François Ozon.

It features an ensemble cast, including Catherine Deneuve, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Béart, Virginie Ledoyen, Firmine Richard, Danielle Darrieux, and Ludivine Sagnier. The plot revolves around the matriarch Gaby (Deneuve) and her seven daughters, Suzon (Ledoyen), Augustine (Richard), Pierrette (Darrieux), Catherine (Huppert), Louise (Ardant), and Danielle (Sagnier). After the sudden departure of their father Marcel (played by master of ceremony Jean-Pierre Lorit) and their maid Josephine (Dominique Lamure), they all gather at a family estate in the Bordeaux region of France on Christmas Eve. When Marcel's body is discovered in the middle of the night, the topic of discussion immediately shifts from who will inherit his estate to who might have killed him. Suspicion immediately falls on one of the women, as everyone in the house had a motive to commit the crime. In order to discover the truth, the women engage in all manner of activities, including bouts of physical and mental testing, heated exchanges, and the sharing and unveiling of dark family secrets. Under the watchful eye of Augustine the lawyer, each character performs a musical solo in an attempt to express their innocence or guilt. Through these performances, a hidden history of resentment, love, regret, and betrayal is revealed. As the mystery gradually unravels, so does the truth of exactly what happened that night. Overall, 8 Women is a thought-provoking murder mystery set to the backdrop of a 1950s French country house. Its intricate plot and complex characters make it a stylishly crafted and entertaining film. It has been critically acclaimed for its hilarious comedy, sharp dialogue, and great soundtrack. The film was a rare box office success in France and has since gained a cult following for its dark humor.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2594435}

It is held annually in Dubai in late November and attracts in excess of 67,000 construction professionals (audited by BPA Worldwide). \n\nThe Big 5 runs alongside six specialised events enabling industry professionals to source products for every stage of the construction projects: The Big 5 Heavy, Middle East Concrete, HVAC R Expo, Middle East Stone, The Big 5 Solar, and the Urban Design & Landscape Expo.\n\nHistory \nThe Big 5 has its origins in an event known as Arab Water and came about from an amalgamation of five separate product-focused events that all had a link to the construction sector - such as HVAC and building materials.\nWith the building of the Dubai World Trade Centre, which began to develop in the late 1970s, the event found a permanent home and has expanded in size along with the venue. When dmg events acquired the exhibition in 2000, the event covered some 12,000m²: this has risen to over 100,000m² in gross floor space. \n\nGovernment support for the event has come from both international and local institutions. In 2007, the event was one of the first in the region to welcome a prime minister when the then Italian leader Romano Prodi visited the exhibition with his minister for international trade. In 2012, British prime minister David Cameron also visited the event in support of his nation’s export businesses. The visits reflected both the value of bilateral trade with the UAE but also the rise in importance of the Persian Gulf region as a whole to European export manufacturers.\n\nEducational events and special features \n\nSince 2010 there has been an increasing emphasis on education within the events - in the form of conferences, seminars and workshops - to support continued professional development among audiences. The educational programmes are presented by a wide selection of the industry’s architects, consultants, contractors and sub-contractors who volunteer their time and expertise to further the development of the construction sector. These free education components also include certification, overseen by the UK-based CPD Certification Service, so attendance can contribute to a person’s membership standing in organisations such as RICS or the CIOB.\n\nIn 2018, The Big 5 launched the Women in Construction Forum & Awards initiative, aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace in the construction industry.

These five species of animals – the lion, elephant, leopard, rhinoceros, and Cape buffalo, are collectively known as the Big 5 because of their large size, imposing power, and their status as the most difficult and sought after animals to hunt on foot in Africa. The Big 5 are among the most iconic animals in the world, and have become symbols of the African savannah. The animals, although often fierce and dangerous, have also come to symbolize strength and power. Among the African people, the animals are seen as protectors of the land, and as such are venerated and respected even when hunted. Lions are a frequently seen symbol of The Big 5, with their iconic manes and regal bearing. Lions often live in prides in the savannah, where they hunt and raise their cubs together. Male lions are larger and heavier than females, spending much of their time patrolling territory, and their iconic roar is used to defend their dominance over a particular area. The African Elephant is the largest living land animal, and is one of the most recognizable animals in the world. Elephants range over large areas and travel together in herds of up to 100 individuals, led by the matriarch. The imposing size of elephants gives them great power and they are able to knock down a tree to get access to food. Leopards are beautiful spotted cats, known for their tremendous power and agility. They have amazing night vision, and are able to take down large prey with their incredible strength. Leopards usually hunt alone, although a female may use her cubs to overwhelm smaller prey. The Rhino is one of the most endangered of The Big 5, primarily due to hunting and poaching for their horn. Rhinos can grow to be very large, with the white rhino being the second largest land mammal in the world. They are heavily protected by conservationists due to their diminishing numbers. The Cape Buffalo is a large, muscular ox-like animal and one of the most dangerous species of Africa. They are well adapted to the African savannah, and live in herds of up to 100 individuals. The cape buffalo may look docile, however, they are fierce and intimidating when provoked. The five species of the Big 5 African animals have an iconic status in the world. They are symbols of power, strength and the African Savannah, revered by both hunters and conservationists alike. They have become some of the most recognizable wild animals in the world, and it is important to remember their conservation status and to ensure we protect these animals for generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51038076}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dieter Lehnhoff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Dieter Lehnhoff Temme (born  27 May 1955) is a German-Guatemalan composer, conductor, and musicologist.\n\nLife\nBorn in Guatemala City to German settlers, 1955, Dieter Lehnhoff Temme has been a pupil of Klaus Ager, Gerhard Wimberger, Josef Maria Horváth, and Dr. Friedrich C. Heller in Salzburg. His musique concréte work Requiem was premiered in 1975 at the Austrian Broadcasting (ORF). \nHe earned his master's (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees with distinction at the Benjamin T. Rome School of Music of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he was a graduate student of Conrad Bernier and Helmut Braunlich (composition), Donald Thulean (conducting), Cyrilla Barr, Ruth Steiner, and Robert M. Stevenson (musicology).\n\nRecent works\nHis original compositions have been performed in Europe and the Americas. His Misa de San Isidro (2001) for a cappella chorus was premiered in Tenerife, the Canary Islands, Spain, in 2002, and has been performed by different professional choirs at festivals in Medellín, Tokyo, and New York City. His Piano Concerto No. 1 (2005), dedicated to the Russian pianist and teacher, Alexandr Sklioutovski, was premiered in June, 2006 at the National Theatre in Guatemala City by José Pablo Quesada as soloist and the Millennium Orchestra, the composer conducting. In 2007, it was performed to critical acclaim and great enthusiasm at the National Theatre in San José, Costa Rica, again with pianist Quesada and the composer conducting the National University Symphony Orchestra. Quesada also performed it at the 15th Latin American Music Festival in Caracas, Venezuela in May, 2008, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Venezuela. Lehnhoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (2007) was very successfully premiered in August, 2008 in Guatemala City by concert pianist Sergio Sandí, with the combined Millennium Orchestra and Bachensemble Leipzig, the composer conducting. The concertos are written in a personal, highly original post-modern style in which contemporary art-music idioms and techniques, but also blues, tango, and jazz influences can be traced. His aphoristical twelve-tone Hai-kai for piano have attracted the attention of scholars such as the distinguished musicologist Dr. Tamara Sklioutovskaia, and have been performed by international pianists. His piano and chamber music has been performed at numerous festivals in Europe, North- and South America. His diptych Escenas primigenias was published on CD and served as a model for cinematic development. His stage work in progress Satuyé, on an own multilingual libretto, is about the Afro-Caribbean Garinagu (or Garifuna) people and their arrival at Central American shores.\n\nRevival of historical music\nHis research of the Music of Guatemala has revealed a previously unknown musical wealth, including the Maya, Renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, 20th century, and current trends. From the early 1980s on, Dieter Lehnhoff had become interested in searching for music composed in Central America and specifically Guatemala during the Spanish rule (1524–1821). His research initiatives brought to light a number of compositions by Renaissance masters Hernando Franco, Pedro Bermúdez, and Gaspar Fernández, as well as Guatemalan baroque composers Manuel José de Quirós, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, Pedro Antonio Rojas, and José Eulalio Samayoa. A first anthology was published in Antigua Guatemala in 1984. The music was revived in a number of concerts conducted by Lehnhoff, thus surprising the musical world with a new repertoire of high quality. The first series of digital recordings (1992–99), which spanned from the late Maya times to the end of the 20th century, was released as part of the monumental Historia General de Guatemala, an encyclopedic publication in six volumes written by over 150 specialists in every historical area. The series of seven CDs included premiere recordings of music from every historical period. The revival of the historic Music of Guatemala through Lehnhoff's concerts, writings, and recordings had a significant effect on the strengthening of the cultural identity of Guatemalans in times of civil confrontation and turmoil. The dissemination of his musical and historical findings at more than 40 international festivals, concerts, congresses, and meetings also helped to restore the cultural image and prestige of the country.\n\nAs a conductor, he has founded and directed various instrumental groups, orchestras, and choral groups. He has been invited to perform as a conductor, composer, lecturer, or leader of his Millennium Ensemble at over forty international festivals and concerts in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela. He has produced a series of compact discs with premiere recordings of works by Guatemalan composers of all times.\n\nAcademic programmes\nIn the academic field he also pioneered by establishing and directing several institutions and programmes devoted to the strengthening of musical culture in Guatemala. Thus, he proposed and carried out the design and establishment of the Music Department at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, which offered, for the first time in the country, a Bachelor's degree and a teaching license in Music.

The Mid-Kent railway line runs along the eastern edge of the ground with New Beckenham railway station adjacent to the south-east corner. The River Pool runs along the western edge the ground.\n\nCricketing history\nThe ground was established in 1920 by the London Joint City and Midland Bank Sports Association, an organisation which dated back to 1871 and became the Midland Bank Sports association in 1923. The first recorded cricket match on the ground was in 1930 when the Club Cricket Conference played the Universities Athletic Union.\n\nThe ground hosted a single List-A cricket match when Kent County Cricket Club beat Lancashire in a rain affected match in the 1970 John Player League. The ground was used as part of the centenary celebrations of the Midland Bank Sports association. The match saw Kent win by scoring more runs in the first nine overs of their innings than Lancashire had scored in their first ten overs, scoring 58 for 1 wicket. The result attracted some controversy because technically Kent had to bat for 10 overs before able to claim a win.\n\nBeckenham was part of Kent until 1965 and the county has played matches at a number of grounds in what it describes as \"Metropolitan Kent\". It maintains a current base at the Kent County Cricket Ground, Beckenham  from the ground.\n\nDuring the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup the ground held a single Women's One Day International when Australia women were beaten by New Zealand women. Debbie Hockley, who top-scored with 38 not out, and Penny Kinsella passed the Australian total of 77 without losing a wicket. Julie Harris took 3 wickets for 15 runs from nine overs for New Zealand as they knocked the favourites Australia out of the tournament in the final series of round-robin matches.\n\nModern use\nIn local cricket, the ground is the home venue of HSBC Cricket Club who play in the Kent Cricket League.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Suicide of Tyler Clementi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 – September 22, 2010) was an American student at Rutgers University–New Brunswick who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River at the age of 18, on September 22, 2010. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred.\n\nRavi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012, on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016.\n\nClementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.\n\nBackground\nClementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.\n\nA few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \"basically completely rejected\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \"sad\" and \"quiet\" as she processed the information and that she \"felt a little betrayed\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \"confident\" and \"comfortable\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.\n\nRavi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on JustUsBoys, a pornographic website and message board for gay men, and tweeted \"Found out my roommate is gay\". Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.\n\nWebcam incidents\n\nFirst viewings\nOn the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.\n\nOn September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\"\n\nSecond attempt\nOn September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39 p.m., Ravi tweeted, \"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.\n\nThe same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\" Clementi wrote in detail on the JustUsBoys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWithin a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.\n\nSuicide\n\nOn the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30 p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42 p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry\".\n\nClementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.\n\nClementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well.\n\nReaction\nShortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\" The same month Clementi died, four other Americans were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.\n\nAt Rutgers University\nRutgers University students planned a \"Black Friday\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\"\n\nBeginning in the 2011–2012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.\n\nBy September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.\n\nCharitable response\nIn 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.\n\nGovernment\nTyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying. US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\" and added, \"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today—I can't.\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71–1 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30–0 vote in the New Jersey Senate.\n\nThe San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.\n\nParents' statements\nThe day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people:\n\nIn the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:\n\nAdvocacy\nIn the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death.\n\nThe incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \"Spirit Day\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.\n\nHowever, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \"pervasive in our culture\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \"the last straw\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not die by suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \"mob mentality\" that focuses on \"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \"adults and institutions\" in society who \"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\", and he concludes that to \"pin all the blame\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \"a coverup\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient—a slap on the wrist.\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\"\n\nThe Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015.\n\nCriticism of media coverage\nSoon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \"media floodgate of distortion\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\"\n\nIn popular culture\nEllen DeGeneres described herself as \"devastated\" by Clementi's death, stating, \"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\"\n\nThe band Rise Against released a song, \"Make It Stop (September's Children)\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other young people who died by suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.\n\nMadonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have died by suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \"The Secret Seven\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.\n\nMonica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.\n\nCourt case\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.\n\nOn March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India.\n\nIn February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.\n\nSee also \n\n The Trevor Project\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Tyler Clementi Foundation\n Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship\n \n\n2010 in LGBT history\n2010 in New York City\nBullying and suicide\nCollege students who committed suicide\nDeaths by person in the United States\nGay history\nLGBT history in New York City\nSuicide of Tyler Clementi\nSuicides by jumping in New York City\nVictims of cyberbullying\nDiscrimination against LGBT people in the United States\nBullying in the United States\nSeptember 2010 events in the United States\nLGBT-related suicides\n2010 suicides\n20th-century LGBT people\n21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": " Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 - September 22, 2010) was an American student who attended Rutgers University. In September 2010, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in New York City. His death was the result of cyberbullying reportedly brought on by his college roommates, who had spied on him when he was having a romantic meeting with another man. Clementi was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey and was the son of Joseph and Jane Clementi. He attended Ridgewood High School where he was an accomplished violinist. He was a member of the local orchestra. After high school, he attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he was studying science. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, and another student, Molly Wei, used a webcam to secretly film him during a romantic encounter with another man. The video was then posted on the internet. The incident received national media attention and sparked intense public outcry against cyberbullying and gay bias. Clementi discovered the footage and posted a short tweet on September 21, which read, “Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.\" On the night of September 22, he posted a final Facebook status saying, \"jumping off the gw bridge, goodbye.\" The next day, Clementi's body was identified when it washed up on the Hudson River shoreline. His death was ruled as a suicide. Although both Ravi and Wei were initially charged with invasion of privacy and related crimes, both eventually accepted plea deals, which included no jail time. Clementi's death prompted a national debate on cyberbullying and ultimately led to the passage of new anti bullying laws throughout the United States. Many universities and organizations have established awards in honor of Clementi's memory, such as the Tyler Clementi Foundation, dedicated to ending bullying and creating safe online environments for young adults. Tyler Clementi's legacy lives on in the fight against online and in-person bullying. His tragedy has been immortalized in novels, documentaries, and musicals. He will always be remembered as a symbol of hope and justice, as well as a reminder of the consequences of cyberbullying.

It is found in the United States and Mexico. Description Cryptocheilus notatus is a medium-sized beetle, around 17–20 mm long in total length. It is typically a deep black, often with bronze tints on its elytra. Its ventral surface is mostly brown, with a reddish sheen. Behavior Cryptocheilus notatus, like many other species of beetle, is a nocturnal, diurnal feeder. It is commonly found feeding on organic matter such as dung, decaying organic material and sap from trees. Habitat Cryptocheilus notatus is found in desert and dry grasslands throughout the United States, particularly in the southwestern and south-central US. It is also found in northern Mexico. Reproduction and Life Cycle Like most species of beetles, Cryptocheilus notatus reproduces by parthenogenesis and has a two-year life cycle. In the spring, adult females lay hundreds of eggs in soil near plants, decaying organic matter, or dung. The eggs hatch within a few weeks and the larvae feed and develop through the summer. Upon reaching maturity they overwinter, pupate in spring, and emerge as adults the following summer. Conservation Status Cryptocheilus notatus is common and widespread throughout its range, and not currently listed as a threatened species. Capture and Keeping as Pets Cryptocheilus notatus beetle is a sought-after pet and is commercially available for purchase. Captive beetles can generally be kept in a small terrarium and fed a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables and small insects. References 1. Zimsen, Erika. \"Chrysina Notata Scarab Beetle\".

She also won the singles title at the 1934 French Championships, defeating Helen Jacobs in the final. She was ranked No. 5 in the world in 1933 and 1934.\n\nEarly life\nMargaret Scriven was born on 18 August 1912 at Chapel Allerton, Leeds. She was educated at home. Her parents were club level tennis players and she played the game from an early age, playing on holiday and entering local tournaments. According to one source, there was a tennis court at her family home and she was coached by her father, Edgar Scriven and by her mother.\n\nCareer\nScriven won the British Junior Championships held at Wimbledon in September 1929. In the final, Scriven defeated Miss P. Burt from Nottingham, 6–1, 6–3.\n\nIn June 1930, Scriven played at the Wimbledon Championships for the first time, where she was beaten in the first round by Miss K. le Messurier.\n\nAt Wimbledon in 1931, Scriven, was far more successful than at first attempt in the previous year. She reached the quarter-finals where she was beaten by the French player, Simonne Mathieu, 1–6, 6–2, 7–5.\n\nIn 1932 she won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, played on the wooden courts at the Queen's Club, after a victory in the final against Kay Stammers.\n\nFor the 1933 French Championships, Scriven was not selected to go with the official British touring party. Instead, she travelled to Paris independently. After beating top British players Mary Heeley and Betty Nuthall on her way to the final,  Scriven won the tournament, beating Simonne Mathieu in the final. She also triumphed in the mixed doubles, partnered by the Australian player, Jack Crawford.\n\nIn early August, 1933, Scriven was part of the losing British team in the Wightman Cup held at Forest Hills, New York.\n\nLater in the same month, Scriven was at Forest Hills for the US Championships. In the singles, she reached the last 16 of the tournament, being knocked out by the American, Josephine Cruickshank. She also competed in the doubles and mixed doubles at the championships. Partnered by the Australian player Jack Crawford, Scriven reached the semi-finals of the mixed doubles.\n\nIn May 1934, Scriven was back at the French Championships, this time as part of the official British team. On 3 June 1934, Scriven retained her French title, beating Helen Jacobs of America, 7–5, 4–6, 6–1. The final started at the late time of 6.30pm and, after two sets had been played, both players appealed against the light. The appeal was turned down, however, and the match continued in twilight. After 3 more games, with Scriven leading 2–1, Jacobs appealed again against the light but was turned down. Scriven went on to win all the remaining games.\n\nAt the French Championships in 1935, Scriven was unable to win the singles for the third time, being beaten in the semi-finals. However, she did win the doubles, partnered by Katherine Stammers.\n\nScriven-Vivian was the last British woman to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament for two consecutive years. In addition, she was the first left-handed woman to win a Grand Slam singles title and was the only unseeded woman ever to win the French Championships or French Open until the 2017 singles title was won by Jeļena Ostapenko.\t\t\n\nShe played for the British Wightman Cup team in 1933, 1934 and 1938.\n\nAccording to A.

Amanda, Scott, and Steve started playing together at an early age, performing in churches and community events around the country. They quickly developed a style that combined their traditional music influences with a modern, country-pop sound. The Storys signed with independent label Attic Light Records and released their self-titled debut album in 2000. The album featured their acoustic-led rootsy songs “Just for You”, “Just Like a Voice in the Night”, “You Can’t Deny”, and “Listen”. The Storys gained critical and radio attention with their powerful harmonies and heartfelt songwriting. The Storys toured extensively in the United States, sharing the stage with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Lyle Lovett, and John Hiatt.

It is based on the television series The Flintstones and is the first Flintstones video game.\n\nGameplay\nYabba Dabba Doo! is set before the marriage of Fred and Wilma Flintstone, during a time when the city of Bedrock was beginning to take shape. Playing as Fred, the player's goal is to build a house and persuade Wilma to move in with Fred, leading to their marriage. The player begins with a plot of land that is covered in small rocks, which must be carried off one at a time and dumped into a nearby pit. Enemies include pterodactyls that try to drop rocks on Fred's head, and turtles and dinosaurs which harm Fred directly. After clearing the rocks from the land, the player then searches Bedrock for boulders, which are used to build the house. Once the house is ready for a roof to be added, the player must get a job at a quarry in order to raise money to hire a dinosaur service, which will allow Fred to reach the top of the house. Throughout the game, Fred must meet with Wilma whenever he comes across her, in order to fill a heart meter which demonstrates her love for him. When the house is complete, the player must find Wilma and get her to follow Fred to the new house, which she will only do if the heart meter is full. Kissing Wilma is also the player's only way to refill the health bar.\n\nBedrock is represented through various screens. The player can move left and right to maneuver between screens located along the same path. Accessing upper and lower screens is done by moving diagonally towards the corner edge of each screen, rather than walking straight up or down. Located within Bedrock is Fred's car, which provides faster transportation between screens if it is found by the player. Buildings in Bedrock include a service station, a burger bar, a drive-in movie theater, and a health club, with the latter three locations being popular hangouts for Wilma. Fred's neighbors are building their own houses, and the player earns bonus points if Fred's house is finished before the others.\n\nReception\n\nThe Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were generally praised for their graphics, with Computer and Video Games (CVG) writing that Fred \"looks as if he's walked directly off the cartoon 'set' and into the computer game.\" However, some reviewers considered the graphics of the ZX Spectrum version to be poor. The game received criticism for the method used to move Fred diagonally between screens, which was considered difficult and confusing. Some critics believed the game would have particular appeal for fans of the television series, while others believed that the game lacked lasting appeal. CVG and Crash offered praise for the sound, although the latter also considered it sparse.\n\nComputer Gamer, in its review of the C64 version, praised the game's concept but considered the enemies too aggressive. The review criticized the lack of weapons to use against enemies, and stated that this along with Fred's \"awkward\" movements between screens \"contributed to spoil the whole game.\" In its review of the ZX Spectrum version, Computer Gamer stated that it had poor playability and was not as colorful as the C64 version, but that its enemies were less hostile.\n\nZzap!64 considered the game to be average and criticized its gameplay, while Commodore Horizons considered it fun. Your Commodore considered the game annoying, while ZX Computing stated that it lacked the fun and action of the television series. Your Sinclair considered it \"a very addictive game once you get the idea of what you're supposed to do.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Yabba Dabba Doo! at MobyGames\n\nVideo games based on The Flintstones\n1986 video games\nAmstrad CPC games\nCommodore 64 games\nZX Spectrum games\nEurope-exclusive video games\nSingle-player video games\nVideo games developed in the United Kingdom", "machine_text": " Yabba Dabba Doo! is an iconic catchphrase which originated in the American animated television series The Flintstones, the first major primetime animated series on television. It is typically used as a celebration of good times and was most famously uttered by the show’s main protagonist Fred Flintstone when excited. In addition to its use in The Flintstones, the phrase has become a popular cultural reference, with multiple uses in popular media and merchandise. The Flintstones aired for six seasons on ABC from 1960 to 1966, and was created by Hanna-Barbera Productions. Released in the same era as The Simpsons, it is believed to have greatly contributed to the success of primetime animation in the United States. The Flintstones centered around the Stone Age adventures of the titular family, who lived in the fictional town of Bedrock. and were comprised of Fred Flintstone, the breadwinner and husband, Wilma Flintstone, his wife, Pebbles Flintstone, their young daughter and Dino, their pet dinosaur. The catchphrase “Yabba Dabba Doo!” was introduced into the show in 1962 by Fred’s character as a way to express joy and excitement, and was said in reaction to moments like a successful golf swing or a beneficial spin in a game of chance. As the series progressed, the phrase began to take on a life of its own, appearing in promotional materials and other pieces of media outside of the show, such as statues and buttons. In addition to becoming a cultural icon in its own right, the saying has made appearances in various movies and television programs over the years. It was most recently used in an episode of the TV show Futurama, as well as an episode of The Simpsons. It has also been featured in songs and video games, such as in an update to the classic game Worms in which a character exclaims “Yabba Dabba Doo!” after victory. As well as its appearance in pop culture, the phrase has also been used to name various clothing brands, toys and other products. In 2010, a popular online clothing store, Yabba Dabba Doo!, was opened in the United Kingdom, and has since expanded to several countries over the years. The phrase has also been used in advertising campaigns and as the name of a beer brand produced by the American brewing company, Anheuser-Busch. In conclusion, “Yabba Dabba Doo!” has become an iconic phrase which has been embraced by the general public as a lighthearted way to show enthusiasm or happiness. Despite its humble origins in the 1960’s, the phrase has been adopted by modern cultures and is now used in various pieces of media, products, and advertisements.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60765202}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Continental collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In geology, continental collision is a phenomenon of plate tectonics that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth.\n\nContinental collision is not an instantaneous event, but may take several tens of millions of years before the faulting and folding caused by collisions stops. The collision between India and Asia has been going on for about 50 million years already and shows no signs of abating.  Collision between East and West Gondwana to form the East African Orogen took about 100 million years from beginning (610 Ma) to end (510 Ma). The collision between Gondwana and Laurasia to form Pangea occurred in a relatively brief interval, about 50 million years long.\n\nSubduction zone: the collision site\nThe process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries.  Oceanic crust is thin (~6 km thick) and dense (about 3.3 g/cm3), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45 km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5 g/cm3). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150 km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.\n\nDeep subduction of continental crust\nThe continental crust on the downgoing plate is deeply subducted as part of the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone.  An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic  coesite and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes.  The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90–140 km deep.  Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie–Sulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali.  Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes.  The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted.\n\nOrogeny and collapse\n \nAn orogeny is underway when mountains begin to grow in the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision is one of the most important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1 mm/year, a 5,000 m tall mountain can form in 5 million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust begins to flow and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and  the two continents are completely sutured.  Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent. \n\nThe pace of mountain building associated with the collision is measured by radiometric dating of igneous rocks or units that have been metamorphosed during the collision and by examining the record of sediments shed from the rising mountains into the surrounding basins.  The pace of ancient convergence can be determined with paleomagnetic measurements, while the present rate of convergence can be measured with GPS.\n\nFar-field effects \nThe effects of the collision are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea and away from the collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.\n\nFossil collision zones\n\nContinental collisions are a critical part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called \"suture zones\" by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or sutured together.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nWhere Continents Collide\nDynamics of Continental Collision Zones\nThe Wilson Cycle\n\nPlate tectonics", "machine_text": " Continental collision is a geological process in which two tectonic plates composed primarily of continental crust come into contact and collide with one another. It is one of several ways of forming mountain ranges, and is most often associated with the collision of two large land masses, but can also occur due to a continental plate colliding with a smaller fragment of continental crust, such as an island arc or microcontinent. Due to the extreme forces at work during such collisions, the colliding continents and the areas around them are often highly deformed and may form fold belts, volcanoes and large faults. Continental collision typically occurs where two continental plates meet, either head-on or obliquely. When two large, continental plates collide head-on, one of the plates is typically subducted, or pushed underneath the other. This creates a mountain range, such as the Himalaya and the Andes mountains. When an oceanic plate and a continental plate meet, they do not usually collide, but instead, the oceanic plate will become subducted beneath the continental plate. In some cases, the edges of the two continental plates may slide past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary and results in a laterally displaced mountain range, such as the Rocky Mountains in the United States, as well as several other mountain ranges in western North America and other parts of the world. Most continental collisions cause large earthquakes and can also trigger volcanic activity, although this is not always the case. During the collision of two continental plates, the crust of each plate becomes crumpled and folded, forming mountains and shallow basins. This can result in the formation of rift valleys, and in some cases, mountain ranges such as the Himalaya, the Alps, the Andes and the Appalachian Mountains, which were all created by continental collisions. Continental collisions are responsible for some of the most dramatic landscapes and geological features on Earth, and are therefore of great interest to geologists and other scientists. There have been many continental collisions throughout Earth's nearly four-and-a-half billion year history and many more still to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2076436}

The album was released in Australia on October 28, 1995 by EMI Music Australia. The album's lead single, \"Every Day of the Week\", was released prior to the album and charted in the top ten of the ARIA Singles Chart, eventually reaching number four. The release of \"Every Day of the Week\" was followed by the four other singles \"Carry the Load\", \"Way Out West\", \"Company of Strangers\" and \"Nothing But You\". Thirteen was Reyne's first and only full-length album to be released in Australia while signed on with EMI Music Australia. The album was certified gold in Australia in 2004. The album was divided into two sections, both themed musically. The first five tracks featured up-tempo rock-orientated music, while the second had five ballads and one semi-ballad. The album was co-produced by Reyne and Anthony Little, with the exception of the single \"Every Day of the Week\". The album was critically acclaimed, receiving the ARIA Award for ‘Best Adult Contemporary Album’ in 1996. This achievement made Reyne the only artist to win more than two awards in one night. The album featured contributions from such artists as Richard Pleasance, Mark Punch, Lloyd Spitzer and Bill Putt, as well as many of Reyne's fellow band members of Australian Crawl. Thirteen featured a number of reworkings of older James Reyne material, including the single \"Company of Strangers\", a re-recording of \"Class of ’81 and the album closer \"Stranger in the House\", which was a re-recording of the Australian Crawl song \"Reckless\". It would be over ten years before another Reyne-penned work would have the same level of success as Thirteen, with the release of his 2006 studio album, Whisper in the Noise, which reached number four on the ARIA Albums Chart.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49960077}

Stavros K. Frangos, author of Greeks in Michigan, stated \"From the 1890s to the present all available sources agree that\" about one third of Michigan's Greek Americans live in Metro Detroit.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century the first Greek immigrants arrived. The first year of entry was 1886. Theodore Gerasimos was the first documented Greek immigrant. Detroit's Greeks began working in automobile factories and railroads, and some others became merchants; many merchants lived above or near their stores. Very few Greeks became farmers in the United States, even though many had backgrounds in agriculture. The first Greek settlement in Detroit was between St. Antoine and Beaubien on Monroe Street. The Greeks later moved to Macomb Street. In the beginning of the year 1900 the city's first Greek coffeeshop opened on 40 Macomb Street.\n\nThere were 250 Greeks in Detroit in 1909. In 1912 persecution of Greeks began, prompting immigration from Greece. The period 1911 to 1917 was the peak immigration period from Greece. In 1914 there were up to 8,000 Greeks in the city. In 1914 a wave of immigration from Greece came because Henry Ford offered his $5 per day jobs. The Greek population rose to 10,000 to 15,000 by 1930.\n\nPeloponnesus was the source of most Greek immigration to Detroit. Frangos wrote that \"While no other reliable statistics are available, certainly Greeks from the three islands of Chios, Crete, and Cyprus have always made up a sizeable element of the community.\" The National Centre of Social Research in Athens, by 1972, estimated that the State of Michigan had ethnic 100,000 Greeks. In 1999 The Detroit News stated that the Greeks were \"well-assimilated.\" By 2012 Detroit's Greeks moved to suburban communities. Suburbs with Greek Americans include Lincoln Park and St. Clair Shores.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically many Greek immigrants operated Coney islands, or restaurants serving Detroit Coney dogs. In the 1960s and early 1970s Greek immigrants established the Coney chains Kerby's Coney Island, Leo's Coney Island, and National Coney Island. All three chains sell some Greek food items with Coney dogs.  A previous Greek-established restaurant, Onassis Coney Island, closed.\n\nGeography\nThe Greek ethnic enclave of Greektown is still active. Because of the Greek immigration, within Michigan the most academic studies on Greek people are conducted in Detroit.\n\nMedia\nAs of 1951 the Greek newspapers published in Metro Detroit included Detroit Athens (Athenai), Greek Tribune, and Michigan AHEPAN. In addition the Californian, a newspaper published in California, and the Chicago-based Greek Star, Greek Press of Chicago, and the National Herald and Atlantis were other Greek newspapers distributed in Metro Detroit.\n\nEducation\nA.H.E.P.A. rented middle school classrooms and church rooms to conduct Greek language classes.\n\nNotable residents\n Louis Perentis - He was a merchant who one of the first Greeks to arrive in Detroit. Richard Bak, author of Detroit: 1900-1930, wrote that he was \"reputed to have been Detroit's first Greek millionaire.\"\n\nReferences\n Frangos, Stavros K.

The first wave of Greek immigrants arrived in the 1880s and brought with them the legacy of their proud Hellenic culture. Greek immigrants began to settle in the area and by 1910, Metro Detroit had one of the largest Greek populations within the United States. Many of these early immigrants found work as laborers and soon established their own businesses. In the 1920s, the close-knit Greek American community started to develop in Metro Detroit. Organizations such as the Greek Orthodox Church of North America were established and soon the Greek immigrants began to create a vibrant and unique ethnic culture. In addition to emphasizing the importance of Hellenic traditions, the Greeks of Metro Detroit were active in the civil rights movement, joining the protests of the 1930s in the fight for equality. Greek Americans living in Metro Detroit continued to make contributions to the city during the 1950s and 60s. Entrepreneurs like George Gikas and Gus Farringer built successful businesses and provided jobs for many members of the Greek community. Furthermore, Greek owned businesses like Astro Coffee and Dakota Inn Rathskeller expanded the range of cultural attractions available for visitors to the city. Today, Detroit’s Greek American community is still thriving and remains deeply involved in the city. Greek Americans have held a variety of important posts, from the mayor of Detroit, to the state’s governor, to the City Council President. Greek Americans have also become leaders in medicine, law, public relations and education. The Greek American identity remains an important part of the fabric of Metro Detroit. Greek immigrants have left an indelible mark on Metro Detroit, and their vibrant culture continues to bring joy and vitality to the city. Each year, Detroit hosts one of the largest Greek festivals in the United States and a variety of Greek restaurants and bakeries can be found throughout the Metro area. Greek Americans remain an integral part of Metro Detroit and their legacy in the city will live on for generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42971982}

It is endemic to Bolivia and found on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Oriental in the Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments.\n\nDescription\nAdult males measure  and adult females  in snout–vent length. The head is wider than it is long; the snout is rounded. The tympanum is ovoid. The dorsa-lateral folds start from above the tympanum and extend to the groin. The canthus rostralis is sharp. Neither fingers nor toes have webbing or lateral fringes. The outer fingers have expanded discs; the toe discs are small. Dorsal skin is shagreened. The dorsum is beige to brown and has some darker markings. There is a dark brown canthal and supra-tympanic stripe. The upper lip has irregular brown blotches. The limbs are barred. The venter is cream, bearing some brown spots. Males have a large vocal sac.\n\nHabitat and conservation\nYunganastes pluvicanorus lives in cloud forest and humid montane forests (Yungas) at elevations of  above sea level. It is both diurnal and nocturnal; males call both day and night on the ground or perching on bushes.\n\nYunganastes pluvicanorus is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused primarily by agriculture.

It is an endemic species, preferring montanePatagonian shrubland habitat, between 700 and 1000 metres above sea level, in the southern central region of the Chile. It was first identified in 2007 by a team of Chilean biologists led by José Cotzillahue. Y. pluvicanorus is a medium-sized frog, typically measuring between 2 and 3.3 centimetres in length. It is brown on its dorsal side and pale yellow to light blue ventrally. It has large eyes and short legs, and its toes are partially webbed. The species prefers to inhabit cloudy, humid montane Patagonian shrubland, and is absent from nearby regions with similar habitat. Y. pluvicanorus reproduces by laying numerous (up to 1000+) eggs in a single mating event in the wet season and these are then guarded by the male until they hatch a few weeks later. Females have been observed to have multiple mates, which increases genetic variability and makes this species more robust. Conservation of Y. pluvicanorus is an important consideration due to its limited range. The species is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List. The key threats to the species are associated with the destruction of its montane habitat, due to deforestation and livestock grazing. conservation efforts include habitat protection, which is the primary management action for the species. Additionally, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in suitable locations have been proposed. Within Chile, Y. pluvicanorus may benefit from the increasing conservation interest in the recently described Patagonian species. These conservation efforts will require improved access to the remote montane habitats in which this species is found and increased recognition of the importance of conserving amphibians as key components of fragile Patagonian ecosystems.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12387731}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bhanj dynasty\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Bhanja dynasty was an ancient dynasty that originated in the Utkala region of modern Odisha before the Gupta Empire arose as an imperial power. The dynasty, of ancient Kshatriya lineage, as documented by Indologist Hermann Kulke, succeeded the Vindhyatabi branch of the Nagas of Padmavati, who ruled from the Keonjhar district of Odisha and included  Satrubhanja, of the Asanpat inscription. The Bhanj later became feudatories of the Bhauma-Kara dynasty.\n\nThe successor branches of the Bhanja rulers became local feudatories to the united realms of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Gajapati Kingdom and eventually, with the advent of British rule became ruling dynasties of the princely states and zamindaries of the region. Prominent branches include the princely states of Mayurbhanj State and Keonjhar State.\n\nHistory\nThe early Bhanjas emerged as leading chieftains succeeding the Nagas of the Vindhyatabi rulers in the Kendujhar and Western Odisha region, inheriting the region that consisted of the preceding Naga ruler Satrubhanja's domains and with the decline of the Gupta Empire who retreated from the Utkal (northern Odisha) region. With the supremacy of Bhauma-Kara dynasty rule in the Utkal region, they ruled as their feudatories which consisted of mandalas.\n\nAccording to early mandala inscriptions, the Bhanjas describe their origins from the mythical peahen likely pointing out to the early peafowl-related traditions of the ancient Bhanja clans which is observed on their emblems which are also shared by the successive branches.\n\nKhinjali and Khijjinga mandala were among the prominent mandalas under Bhauma-Kara rule.\n\nKhinjali mandala\nKhinjili mandala comprised areas of modern-day Boudh, Phulbani, Nayagarh, Ghumusar and Sonepur. Its capital was at Dhritipura (modern Boudh). Nettabhanja, who ruled over the Dhenkanal-Anugul region and made Nava-angulakapatana his capital, was regarded by R.D. Banerji and R.C. Majumdar as the earliest Bhanja king of the khinjali mandala line. The early Bhanjas were powerful feudatory rulers of independent sovereign principalities in early medieval Odisha. The territory passed into the hands of the Somavanshis after Ranabhanja, then his son Netribhanja established a new territory named after Khinjali. Copperplate inscriptions of Yasobhanja and his brother Jayabhanja at Antirigam and Kanakabhanja at Baudh show Bhanja rule continued in the Khijali region until the 12th century CE.\n\nDuring the early 10th century CE, with political instabilities in the Bhauma-Kara kingdom, the neighboring Somavamshi and Bhanja dynasties attempted to conquer the region, leading to dissensions and political intrigues. The Bhanjas of Khinjali also married two of their princesses (Vakula Mahadevi and Dharma Mahadevi) to the Bhauma-Kara kings Shubhakaradeva V and his father Shantikaradeva III, and later controlled the Bhauma-Kara kingdom through them. The Bhauma-Kara territory eventually came under the control of the dominant Somavamshis.\n\nEarly Bhanjas of Khinjali mandala\nSilabhanja I (8th cen CE)\nSatrubhanja (8th cen CE)\nRanabhanja (9th cen CE)\nNetribhanja I (Nettabhanja I)\nDigbhanja\nSilabhanja II\nVidyadharbhanja\nNettabhanja II\n\nBaudh Bhanjas of Khinjali mandala\nSolanabhanja\nDurjayabhanja\nKanakabhanja\n\nLater Bhanjas of Khinjali mandala\nDevabhaja\nRayabhanja I\nVirabhanja\nRayabhanja II\nYasobhanja (12th cen CE)\nJayabhanja (12th cen CE)\nVirabhanja II\n\nKhijjinga mandala\nKhijjinga, or Khijjinga-Kotta, comprised areas of modern-day Mayurbhanj and Kendujhar. Inscriptions refer to them as the founders of the Adi-Bhanja dynasty. The early history of Bhanja rule at Khijjinga is known from the copper plate inscriptions found at Bamanghaty near Rairangpur of Ranabhanja and Rajabhanja and the Khandadeuli inscription of Ranabhanja. The founder of the dynasty was Virabahdra Adi Bhanja with his capital located at Khijjinga Kota (now Khiching). The Kichakeshwari Temple was also built, by Khijjinga Bhanja ruler Rajabanja, according to inscriptions. The descendants of the Khijjinga mandala would later form the royal house of Mayurbhanj and its branches after the decline of the Somavamshis which occurred as a result of the advent of Eastern Ganga rule and subsequent unification of the Trikalinga (Utkala, Kalinga and Dakshin Koshala).\n\nVirabhadra Adi-Bhanja (8th cen CE)\nKottabhanja \nDigbhanja\nRajabanja\nRanabhanja (924 CE Bamanghaty inscription)\nNarendrabhanja\n\nBhaumakara kingdom\nTwo princesses of the Khinjali Bhanjas, Vakula Mahadevi and Dharma Mahadevi, married the Bhauma-Kara kings Shubhakaradeva V and his father Shantikaradeva III, and later became the regnal monarchs of the Bhauma-Kara kingdom in their own right.\n\nVakula Mahadevi (934–940)\nDharma Mahadevi (940–943)\n\nBhanja successor states\n\n Ancient Bhanja clans\n Khijjinga mandala\n Mayurbhanj branch\n Kanika branch\n Bastar branch\n Garh Haladia branch\n Keonjhar branch\n Baudh branch\n Daspalla branch\n Khinjali mandala\n Ghumusar branch\n\nMayurbhanj branch\n\nThe influence of the Khijjinga Bhanjas declined following the dominance of the Somavamshis in the Utkal region, but centuries later came back to prominence in the region with the rise of the Eastern Ganga dynasty after uniting the three realms of Trikalinga with the Bhanjas as their feudatories. Traditions point to numerous origins of the dynasty, but lack of records renders them unlikely although it is generally accepted that the founder, Adi Bhanja of the 8th century CE established the current dynasty of the Mayurbhanj state with his brother Jyoti Bhanja founding the Keonjhar State succeeding from the Khijjinga Adi Bhanja dynasty.\n\nKeonjhar branch\n\nAccording to traditions, Keonjhar State was founded sometime during the 12th century during the rule of the Eastern Ganga dynasty when the founder Jyoti Bhanj of the Bhanj dynasty, who was the brother of Adi Bhanj of Mayurbhanj, was enthroned as the Raja of Keonjhar with the help of dominant local Bhuyan clans. The influence of Bhuyans on the enthronement rituals and regnal traditions of Keonjhar suggests a long-standing relationship with the kingdom.\n\nBaudh branch\n\nWith the advent of Eastern Ganga rules over the region post the defeat of the Somavamshis, there were local chieftains ruling over Baudh as Eastern Ganga feudatories. Upon a time the Brahmin chieftain was childless and hence adopted the nephew of the neighboring Raja of Keonjhar who belonged to the Bhanj dynasty. This prince named Ananga Bhanja named himself Ananga Deva and became the King of Baudh in the 14th century.\n\nDaspalla branch\n\nIn the late 15th century around 1498 CE, Naren Bhanja, the brother of the Raja of Baudh was made chieftain of the Daspalla region, from which he later seceded and declared his independent kingdom leading to the creation of the Daspalla State.\n\nBastar branch\n\nThe Bastar state was long ruled by the descendants of the Kakatiya dynasty until the 1920s when King Rudra Pratap Deo's daughter and heir Rani Prafulla Kumari Devi married Prince Prafulla Chandra Bhanj Deo, who was the nephew of the King of Mayurbhanj Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo. Their son Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo became the first and only Bhanja ruler of Bastar from 1936 until 1948 when it acceded to India following Independence.\n\nKanika branch\nThe Kanika Bhanja branch was established by Bhujabal Bhanja, the brother of the Mayurbhanj state most likely around the 3rd century. It remained a prominent zamindari during the reigns of the Trikalingapati and Gajapati monarchs and also supported the Khurda rulers against the British after they took over Orissa from the Maratha Empire in 1803. After the Independence in the year 1947, it was certainly merged into the state of odisha following which the zamindari estates were abolished.\n\nGarh Haladia branch\nThe Haladia estate was an ancient Vassal state of the Gajapati Empire which was ruled on their behalf by the Bhanj Monarchs. They are a branch of Mayurbhanj State but swore allegiance to the Gajapati Maharaja of Puri. It was founded by Anu Bhanj Deo, a scion of the Mayurbhanj Raj family who around the 11th century CE, came to Puri, married the daughter of the then Gajapati Maharaja of Puri, and obtained the estate as her dowry. Legend has it, that Anu Bhanj Deo along with his elder brother Chani Bhanj Deo came to Puri to attend the court of the Gajapati Maharaja at the behest of the then Maharaja of Mayurbhanj. It was during a Court proceeding that Chani Bhanj dossed off, this angered the Gajapati Maharaja who then threw a grape at him. Seeing this, Anu Bhanj, who was also present at the court threw his dagger at the grape and sliced it before it touched his elder brother. This Act of Loyalty towards his brother and the vigor with which he defended him impressed the Gajapati Maharaja. The Maharaja gave his daughter in marriage to Anu Bhanj Deo and made him the Raja of Haridra Estate, commonly known as Haldia Estate. Ramesh Chandra Bhanja prominent Linguist and Historian, belongs to this Branch.\n\nGhumusar branch\nThe rulers of Ghumusar zamindari were descendants of the Bhanja rulers of Khinjali mandala whose rule ended in the Boudh region as the Somavanshis conquered their territory during their conflicts with the Bhauma-Kara rulers during the 10th century CE and were eventually pushed into the Ghumusar region post 12th century where they set up their kingdom. They established their capital at a place called Kullad (A place near Bhanjanagar). Ghumusar Bhanja rulers contributed much to the development of Odia literature during the Riti Yuga/Bhanja Yuga phase like Balabhadra Bhanja, Tribikram Bhanja, Dhanajaya Bhanja,Ghana Bhanja and  Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja.\n\nThe Ghumusar branch came to an end during the rule of Dhananjaya Bhanja II in 1835 when the British annexed the Ghumusar region after suppressing the Ghumusar rebellion of 1835-36.\n\nGallery\n\nExternal Link\n\n \"Indian royal princesses transform family palace into hotel dubbed 'a living museum'.

It is believed that the dynasty was founded by one Raja Bhanja, who is believed to have come from the regions of the South east. It is believed that this dynasty was founded by the Gajapati kings of Odisha. The dynasty is known for its patronage of the arts and literature and also for its great temples and monuments. The Bhanj rulers were famous for their gallantry and were acknowledged as fine warriors. They were also renowned for their great works of art, architecture and literature. The court of the Bhanj rulers was known for its elaborate rituals, ceremonies and patronage of literature, art and culture. The main rulers of the dynasty were Raja Bhanja, Bhanja Ajay, Bhanja Bikram, Bhanja Akhay, and Bhanja Rudra. Raja Bhanja was the first ruler of the dynasty, who ruled for more than half a century. He was succeeded by his son Bhanja Ajay, who was well known for being a powerful ruler and making daring military expeditions against the neighbouring rulers. He also founded a number of cities and temples in Odisha. The third Bhanj ruler, Bhanja Bikram, was known for his military prowess and for his devout patronage of Vedic studies. He was succeeded by his son Bhanja Akhay, who further consolidated his father’s kingdom, and then by the final ruler, Bhanja Rudra. The Bhanj Dynasty was a thriving Hindu dynasty in the 12th century and a landmark in the history of Odisha. During their rule, they had control over the territories stretching from modern-day Odisha to Bengal. Their patronage of and commitment towards the Vedic tradition and its literature was unparalleled, and their works form an important part of the Hindu literary tradition. The dynasty’s most famous works are the Charyapadas, some of the earliest known works of Indian literature that are written in an early form of the Sanskrit language. The dynasty was eventually defeated and overthrown by the Gajapati king Mukunda Dev. His successor Gajapati Prataparudra Dev who assumed the throne in 1434 A.D. is said to have built the majestic temple of Lord Jagannath in Puri, which is a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus. The shrine is also known as the Bhanja Khetra. The Bhanj rulers marked an important and powerful era in the history of Odisha and left behind a rich legacy and culture. Despite the decline of their kingdom, the works from their period will forever remain an integral part of the literature and culture of Odisha. The end of the Bhanj dynasty also marked the initiation of a new era in the history of Odisha and Bengal.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43295175}

Under the pen-names Martin Grainger and Maurice Brinton, he wrote and translated for the British group Solidarity from 1960 until the early 1980s. As a neurologist, he produced the accepted criteria for brainstem death, and wrote the entry on death for Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nLife\nChris Pallis was born to a prominent Anglo-Greek family, \"of whose intellectual achievements he was always extremely proud\". The poet Alexandros Pallis was a great-uncle, and so the writers Marietta Pallis and Marco Pallis were also relatives. His father Alex was general manager of the family firm of merchant bankers, Ralli Brothers; when he retired, he returned from India to settle in Switzerland. Educated there, Chris Pallis became fluent in French, English and Greek.\n\nIn 1940 the family managed to take the last boat out of France, and settled in England. Pallis went up to study medicine at Balliol College, Oxford in 1941. Joining the Communist Party of Great Britain, he was quickly expelled for criticising its policy on the Second World War, and became a member of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist Party.\n\nIn 1947 he married Jeanne Marty, a working-class French university student, and for a decade he dropped out of politics to pursue his medical career. In 1957 he joined the Trotskyist group led by Gerry Healy, the Club, which in 1959 became the Socialist Labour League. He was expelled by Healy in 1960 and with a group of other ex-members of the SLL immediately set up Solidarity. Like a number of other former members of the SLL he was also involved with the journal International Socialism in the early 1960s.\n\nFor the next 20 years, he combined a distinguished medical career under his real name with pseudonymous revolutionary socialist writing and translation. When he was outed for his use of the name Martin Grainger in such left wing journals as the New Statesman, he changed his pseudonym. Subsequently his boss, Christopher Booth, defended him from further press criticism, saying he was a fine neurologist entitled to his own political views.\n\nHis work includes several eyewitness accounts of key moments in European left politics (the Belgian general strike of 1960, Paris in May 1968, Portugal's Carnation Revolution in 1974–75), a substantial body of English translations of the work of Cornelius Castoriadis, the main thinker of the French group Socialisme ou Barbarie, and two short books – one (The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control, 1970) on the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution, and one (The Irrational in Politics, 1974) on sexual politics. \n\nThe publishers of a recent online edition of The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control describe it as follows:\n\nChris Pallis died in March 2005.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBrinton, Maurice (Goodway, David ed).

John Bannerman always treasured his Highland heritage and was a native Gaelic speaker.  Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy and Glasgow High School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to Balliol College, Oxford and later to Cornell University in the United States.\n\nIn 1931 he married Ray Mundell and they had two sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was the Liberal Democrat MP, Ray Michie (later Baroness Michie of Gallanach). The historian John Bannerman was his son, and Donald Shade Munro, the rugby player and coach was his grandson.\n\nRugby union\n\nSchool and College Rugby\n\nBannerman started playing rugby union while at school, and between 1919–20, he was captain of Glasgow High School's 1st XV.\n\nBannerman was an accomplished sportsman winning a \"rugby blue\" at Oxford\n\nProvincial career\n\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1922 inter-city match.\n\nInternational career\n\nHe won 37 caps for Scotland, playing in all that country's internationals between 1921 and 1929 and was Scotland's most capped player until 1962 when Hugh McLeod surpassed his total. He played in Scotland's first “grand slam” winning team in 1925, securing this achievement by beating England in the opening match of the new Murrayfield Stadium. In 1926 he played in the Scotland team that beat England at Twickenham and France in Paris, a feat that no Scottish team would repeat until 2021, 95 years later.\n\nHe went on to become Glasgow HSFP's most capped player.\n\nAdministrative career\n\nIn 1954–55, Bannerman served as President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\n\nCareer\nIn 1930, Bannerman was appointed as a farm manager on land owned by the Duke of Montrose. In 1952 Bannerman left the Montrose estate to become a farmer in his own interests and also that year became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Festival of Britain.\n\nPolitics\nBannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. From 1942 to 1957 he was a Forestry Commissioner. In 1938 he was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Argyll. When the seat fell vacant in 1940 it was mooted that Bannerman might run as a Liberal National but the negotiations with the Conservatives broke down robbing him of his best chance of entering the House of Commons. He contested Argyll unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election and Inverness in 1950. But in 1954 he was the candidate in an extraordinary by-election at Inverness which some historians have seen as a true turning point in Liberal fortunes in Scotland and perhaps the United Kingdom. From a position where there had been no Liberal candidate in the 1951 election, Bannerman jumped into second place over Labour, coming just 1331 votes behind the Tory winner. This was the best Liberal by-election performance since the war. At the general election of 1955, Bannerman came even closer, losing by just 966 votes. Although his vote share declined in the 1959 general election, the ground had been laid for a successful attack on the seat in the 1964 general election by Russell Johnston, who held the seat until he retired from the Commons in 1997.\n\nBannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1954 to 1964 and Rector of Aberdeen University in 1957. He made other attempts to enter the Commons, including giving Labour a close run at the Paisley by-election of 1961, registering 41.3% of the vote in a seat where there had been no Liberal candidate at the 1959 general election. He tried again without success at Paisley at the 1964 general election but in December 1967 he was made Baron Bannerman of Kildonan, of Kildonan in the County of Sutherland, and so finally entered Parliament.\n\nLife peerage\nBannerman was one of three Liberals to be made life peers in 1967; the others were Tim Beaumont and John Foot. Their appointments were attacked by the Young Liberals as undemocratic. One particular critic was Tony Greaves, then editor of the Young Liberal publication Gunfire, who argued that as the Liberal Party was in favour of a new social and political order, it was quite wrong to participate in the most pathetic feature of the existing order, the House of Lords. (Greaves would become Baron Greaves of Pendle in 2000).\n\nIn his maiden speech in the Lords, Bannerman took up the Scottish cause, referring to the anger of Hamilton where the Scottish National Party had just won a parliamentary by-election; and warning it was the anger of two centuries in which the Scots had been a \"sleeping partner\" in the United Kingdom political scene.\n\nGaelic culture\nIn 1922 he won the prestigious gold medal for solo singing at the Royal National Mòd in Fort William. He was President of An Comunn Gàidhealach, the national Gaelic Society, a position previously held by his father,  from 1949 to 1954.\n\nDeath \nHe died in Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969 aged 67.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Bath, Richard (ed.)

He also was the publisher of B'nai Brith's newspaper, Jewish Tribune from 1985 until September 2014.\n\nDimant was the CEO of Christians United for Israel Canada from January 2015 until 2019. He  was, from 2015 until 2018, dean of the Modern Israel Studies Department at Canada Christian College and School of Graduate Theological Studies where he had been chair of the department since 2008. As of 2019, Dimant is no longer associated with the college. \n\nDimant was appointed national chairman of Likud Canada in June 2019.\n\nBackground\nOriginally from Montreal, Quebec, Dimant was educated at Yeshiva University and at McGill University's Graduate School of Sociology. He describes himself as a \"disciple of the teachings of Zev Jabotinsky\".\n\nDimant was the central region director of the Canadian Zionist Federation in the early 1970s.\n\nB'nai Brith\nDimant retired from B'nai Brith Canada after a tenure of 36 years in September 2014 and was replaced by Michael Mostyn.\n\nIn 2014, Dimant told the Canadian Jewish News he planned to nominate Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"moral leadership in the world… especially when it comes to standing up to radical Islamist terrorism.\"  Diamant's announcement sparked a petition to the Nobel adjudication committee to protest the proposed nomination, stating it \"would be a disgrace and insult to [the] prestigious award.\" In January of that year, Dimant and other Jewish leaders had accompanied the prime minister on his first trip to Israel, at which time Dimant praised Harper's \"unparalleled\" support for the Jewish state.\n\nOn July 8, 2015, the Toronto Star reported that Dimant had demanded an annual retirement payout of $175,000, representing 75% of his former salary, which the B'nai Brith believed was too lucrative and would have required the struggling charity to direct  fundraising dollars to pay for Dimant's pension. Dimant stated that the payout was approved by the organization's board, however, the Star cited an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant's retirement, B'nai Brith Canada put its \"state of the art\" care facility for Alzheimer's patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project,  initiated and led by Dimant, was a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that had been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors.\n\nThe Toronto Star article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant's former management of B'nai Brith were a lack of records, failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance, with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B'nai Brith organizations learning that this was not the case, as Dimant's management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\nCanadian Orthodox Jews\nMcGill University alumni\nYeshiva University alumni\nJewish Canadian activists\nBusinesspeople from Montreal\nActivists from Montreal\nCanadian newspaper publishers (people)\nCanadian Zionists\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": " Frank Dimant (born 18 May 1962) is a Canadian entrepreneur and executive who has made a name for himself in the fields of human rights, business, and religious freedom.

Upon its release, Nocturnal was generally well-received, with critics praising its technical metal sound and the diversity of songs on the album. Speaking about the album's themes, vocalist Trevor Strnad has said that \"Lyrically, Nocturnal is kind of a nightmarish journey through the back alleys and graveyards of horror-charged imagery\". Strnad has also noted that the horror themes were a way of the band exploring topics of death, the afterlife and social issues, adding that \"it's about trying to find a form of solace and comfort in all the terrible things that are happening around us, and all the hauntings that you can feel from the outside world\". The album also featured several guest appearances, including keyboards from Joshua Myers of The Red Chord and an acoustic guitar solo from Matt Negrete. The artwork was painted by Trevor Storey, and was intended to capture the themes explored in the album. Nocturnal went on to be a successful release for The Black Dahlia Murder, and the band embarked on a tour in support of the album, during which they played selections from the album. The tour featured such bands as Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, and Between the Buried and Me.

Born in Hastings, Nebraska, he was an outfielder and first baseman who appeared in 1,393 Major League Baseball games over 14 seasons (1939–52) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers. He threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as  tall and . He was nicknamed \"Cotney\" as a youth because of his blond (\"cotton-top\") hair.\n\nAs a Cardinal and Yankee, Hopp appeared in five World Series between  and  and was a member of the winning team in four of them.\n\nPlaying and coaching career\nHopp graduated from Hastings High School, attended Hastings College and was signed by the Cardinals in 1936. He apprenticed in their extensive farm system for four seasons, hitting over .300 three times.\n\nCardinals\nHopp made his Cardinal debut on September 18, 1939, and entered the big leagues for good the following season. During his first season as a regular, , Hopp started 75 games in the outfield and another 33 as backup first baseman to slugger Johnny Mize. He batted .303 with 135 hits, including 25 doubles and 11 triples, third in the National League. He also stole 15 bases, fifth-most in the league. Both  and  saw Hopp slump at the plate, but contribute to back-to-back Cardinal pennants. In the 1942 World Series, Hopp started all five games at first base, and although he collected only three singles in 17 at bats to the cause, St. Louis won the world championship over the New York Yankees, four games to one.\n\nThen, in , he had his best overall season. Playing as the Cardinals' everyday center fielder (in the absence of Terry Moore, who was performing World War II military service), Hopp reached career highs in hits (177), runs scored (106), doubles (35), home runs (11) and runs batted in (72); his batting average (.336) was his second-best. The Redbirds won their third consecutive National League championship. In the all-St. Louis 1944 World Series, he again started all six games and played errorless ball as the Cardinals won their second world title in three seasons, overcoming the Browns. Hopp had a relatively quiet Series at the plate, collecting five singles in 17 at bats.\n\nBraves\nThe last wartime season, , saw Hopp become the Cardinals' regular right fielder, and his batting average fell to .289 as St. Louis finished second, three games behind the Chicago Cubs. That off-season, Cardinal manager Billy Southworth moved to the Boston Braves, and with the surplus of major-league talent coming back from wartime service, Boston began purchasing players who had contributed to Southworth's successful Cardinal teams of 1940–45. They obtained Hopp for shortstop Eddie Joost and cash on February 5, 1946. The trade led to Hopp's second-most-productive campaign. Splitting time between first base and center field, he collected 148 hits and batted .333, and stole a career-high 21 bases. Selected to the 1946 National League All-Star team, Hopp started in center field at Fenway Park on July 9 and singled against Bob Feller in two at bats. It would be his only career All-Star appearance.\n\nPirates\nHopp returned to the Braves in , but was platooned in center field with right-handed-hitting Mike McCormick and his average fell to .288. That November, he was swapped to the Pirates for their center fielder, Jim Russell, in a five-player deal. Hopp would be the Pirates' regular center fielder in  and , with the exception of a three-week period in the latter season. On May 18 of that year, he was traded to the Dodgers for outfielder Marv Rackley. He appeared in eight games for Brooklyn, including two starting assignments, but went 0-for-14 at the plate, dropping his average to .174 on the season. Then, on June 7, the trade was canceled and Rackley and Hopp returned to their original clubs. Hopp responded by batting .335 with 106 hits through the rest of the season for the Pirates (raising his final average to .306). His hot streak continued in  when, as the Bucs' starting first baseman, Hopp added another 108 safeties. He was hitting .340 on September 5 when last-place Pittsburgh sent him to the Yankees in a waiver deal.\n\nYankees\nThe Yankees were then embroiled in a pennant scramble with the Detroit Tigers, and Hopp's game-winning pinch hit grand slam against the Browns on September 17 contributed to the Yankees' surge to the American League championship. He went 9-for-27 (.333) as a Yankee during that stretch drive. Allowed to participate in the World Series despite his post-August-31 acquisition, Hopp got into three games and was hitless in two at bats. He hung on in the American League as a part-time player for the next two seasons. In , Hopp was a pinch hitter and the Yankees' third-string first baseman (behind Joe Collins and Mize) and made his final World Series appearance, drawing a walk in his only plate appearance in Game 3.\n\nThe Yankees released Hopp in late May 1952 and he caught on days later with the Tigers, who had fallen all the way from pennant contention in 1950 to last place in . Appearing mostly as a pinch hitter, Hopp batted only .217 for the Tigers and retired as an active player.\n\nCareer summary\nIn his 14 MLB seasons, Hopp collected 1,262 hits, with 216 doubles, 74 triples, 46 home runs and 458 runs batted in. He hit .296 lifetime and stole 128 bases. Defensively, Hopp posted a .986 fielding percentage playing first base and all three outfield positions. Although on the winning side in four of the five World Series he played in, Hopp batted .160 (with eight hits, all singles) with no runs batted in 50 Fall Classic at bats.\n\nHis last big-league manager, Fred Hutchinson, appointed Hopp to his coaching staff with the 1954 Tigers and 1956 Cardinals.\n\nAfter baseball\nHopp then left pro baseball and returned to Hastings, where he worked for Kansas-Nebraska Energy, conducted baseball schools and was a motivational speaker. He was elected to the Lincoln Journal's Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame (1985) and the Nebraska High School Hall of Fame (1997).

This concept has been explored extensively in literature, films, television, video games, and other forms of media. The vision of future worlds typically centers on technological and socio-economic advances that have drastically changed the way people live, work, and play. Whether depicting a utopian paradise of advancement or a dystopian wasteland of destruction, all versions of the future promise a glimpse into the potential that lies in store for humanity. If not for the constant refinement and evolution of technology, many of the imagined futures presented in books, movies, and video games would not be possible. Examples of future worlds presented in media are plentiful. In literature, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or George Orwell's 1984 explore the potential of societies vastly different from our own. In film, Joss Whedon's Serenity, Christopher Nolan's Inception, and James Cameron’s Avatar offer fascinating visions of the future. Television series such as Star Trek, Babylon 5, and Battlestar Galactica are also noteworthy in this regard. Video games are perhaps the medium most closely associated with the concept of future worlds. Examples such as Bioshock, Half-Life 2, and Mass Effect all feature visually stunning environments where the player experiences life outside of our reality. In each of these, the player is tasked with wandering through unknown and highly advanced environments full of unique challenges. Future worlds in media are often used to explore the potential consequences of humanity’s behavior over time. By leaving familiar surroundings and entering a world not yet realized, readers, viewers, and players can see firsthand the potential options available to society and its future inhabitants. In this way, future worlds can be seen as a kind of warning against the dangers of unchecked progress and ambition. Although always highly speculative, future worlds have become an integral part of the human experience in the modern age. By immersing oneself in an unknown reality that promises to be greater than anything which has come before, we can gain a glimpse of how our current actions and decisions may shape the future of our species.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46274436}

Along with her younger cousin, Grace Stepney, she lives with her wealthy aunt, Julia Peniston. \n\nLily genuinely admires lawyer Lawrence Selden, but he is too poor for her to seriously consider marrying. Her choices are limited to coarse, vulgar Simon Rosedale, a rising financier, and wealthy but dull Percy Gryce. Lily’s friend Judy Trenor urges her to pursue Gryce. Lily, however, cannot help preferring Selden, and during a country weekend, they take a long walk and share an innocent kiss. Gryce, with whom Lily has broken two appointments, leaves abruptly. Fearful for her future, a dejected Lily pours out her troubles to Judy's husband, Gus Trenor. He leads her to believe he will help her earn money through investment. Later, Lily purchases scandalous letters written by Bertha Dorset revealing that Selden was her lover. Lily is hurt, but keeps the letters secret.\n\nAt a wedding, Lily receives a $5,000 check from Gus Trenor, who claims to have reinvested another $4,000. Later, he invites Lily to the opera, where she is seen by her disapproving aunt and Lawrence Selden as she sits with Trenor and Rosedale. Trenor tricks her into leaving the opera and accompanying him to his home, where he tries to kiss her, claiming that Lily is not playing a fair game when she accepts his money but refuses him her attentions. When Lily arrives home, her aunt refuses to loan her the money to repay the $9000 she received from Trenor. Lily confides in Grace, asking if she should turn to Selden for his understanding, but Grace advises against it; she loves Lawrence and is jealous of Lily. Lily had arranged a later appointment with Selden while at the wedding, and she counts on his love for her to overcome her foolish mistakes.\n\nWhile Lily is hoping to hear from Selden, Rosedale visits, proposing to her as if suggesting a corporate merger. His wealth could free Lily, yet she politely rejects his flattering but cold blooded proposal. Bertha Dorset invites Lily to the Dorsets' yacht for a European cruise. Lily accepts, desperate to escape the debts, whispers and criticism in New York.\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Mrs. Carry Fisher meets with Selden, who has arrived from London. They are both worried about Lily, travelling on the Dorsets’ yacht. Lily and George Dorset converse on deck while a young man reads French poetry to Bertha. While ashore that evening, Lily and George look for them in vain before returning to the yacht. Next morning, George enters Lily's cabin, accusing her of knowing about Bertha's indiscretions with the young poet. Lily pleads ignorance of Bertha’s behavior but when Bertha returns and Lily confronts her, saying she can no longer divert George’s attention from Bertha’s affair, Bertha turns the tables by accusing Lily of adultery with George, since Lily was alone aboard the yacht with him all night.\n\nBack in New York, the Dorsets are still in marital discord and Aunt Julia has died. Lily receives only a fraction of her vast fortune, the bulk having been left to Cousin Grace. Now homeless and adrift, Lily is invited by Carry Fisher to stay with her and the Gormers for the summer. Carry believes Lily's two possibilities for marriage are George Dorset and Simon Rosedale. George asks Lily for the truth about his wife Bertha's infidelities, but she denies any knowledge of them. In her growing desperation she approaches Simon Rosedale. He has found out about Bertha's letters and advises Lily to use them to force Bertha to restore her social standing. He offers to marry Lily once she and Bertha are reconciled, but Lily refuses.\n\nLily starts working for the social-climbing Mrs. Hatch as her social secretary. Selden tells Lily this hurts her social standing, but she needs the money. They argue and part on bad terms. Lily goes to the pharmacy for Mrs. Hatch's laudanum sleeping medication, and begins taking it herself. After Mrs. Hatch gets into society, she discovers that Lily's reputation is a liability, so she fires her. Lily gets a job sewing for a milliner, but her growing addiction leads to her being fired for poor work. Lily visits her cousin Grace for a loan but is rejected.\n\nLily almost confronts Bertha Dorset with the letters written to Mr. Selden, but finding that the Dorsets have left town, she goes to Lawrence Selden, telling him she knows she lost his love. When Lawrence isn't looking, she throws the letters in his lit fireplace. Lily goes home and finds her inheritance has at last been delivered. She puts the check in an envelope she addresses to her bank, and writes another for Gus Trenor, resolving the massive debts, and then takes a fatal dose of the laudanum, drifting off to oblivion in her darkened room.

Lily Bart is a young and beautiful socialite who desires marriage to a wealthy man, but ends up in a tumultuous battle between what she wants and society's expectations of her. She ultimately finds herself in a struggle between her own integrity and the restrictions of an unrelenting society, as scandal and tragedy take a toll on her life. The main cast also includes Dan Aykroyd, Eric Stoltz, Eleanor Bron, Jodhi May, Laura Linney, and Anthony LaPaglia. The film was produced by Michael Taylor and produced and directed by Davies, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film received mixed reviews, with some critics praising Anderson's performance and Davies' writing and directing, while others described the film as slow and dull. Despite this, the film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, a Satellite Award for Best Cinematography, and the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best British Film. Anderson received critical praise for her performance and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama. The House of Mirth has largely been seen as an adaptation that stays true to the novel while adding a visual flair to its setting and style. It stands as an example of Terence Davies' skill at adapting literature to the screen, and continues to be a key title in any film studies course dealing with Wharton's literature.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15670779}

Further fortified in the Middle Ages, tradition holds that it was for several centuries the seat of Clan MacKinnon. It is located east of Kirkibost on the west shore of Loch Slapin.\n\nHistory \nThe original structure of Dun Ringill is consistent with an Iron Age Broch dating to approximately the first years of the common era. The main and subordinate structures were occupied and modified throughout its history until the 19th century. Tradition relates that the structure was occupied by the MacKinnons as their clan seat well before the 16th century. It is mentioned in historical texts in the 16th century, after which the MacKinnons moved their seat to Dunakin.<ref name=\"Lochalsh' pp. 39-43\">The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39-43. Miket, R., and Roberts, D. Birlin Limited, 2007, .</ref>\n\n Description \n\nDun Ringill today is a stacked stone ruin overlooking Loch Slapin. The present structure is approximately  in height and  on each side, with a ditch following the outer wall. Its most notable feature is the central landward facing doorway approximately  high that leads into the center of the structure. The interior of the structure contained two rectangular buildings measuring . The original layout was similar to that of a broch, a form of complex Atlantic roundhouse.\n\nA stone wall foundation encloses area adjacent to the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation. A site survey has shown that there are remains of other buildings in the immediate vicinity; and although their age is uncertain, it is likely their construction and occupation was throughout the history of Dun Ringill up until the 19th century.\n\nTo the north and west is a hilly coastal plain. Loch Slapin lies to the east and south of the structure. On either side of the structure are earth and stone ramps that descend down to the ocean. These ramps likely allowed easy access to the water and shipping. Since roads in this part of Skye did not exist until recent times, sea travel was the predominant mode of transportation.\n\n In popular culture \nThe rock band Jethro Tull performed a song entitled \"Dun Ringill\" on their 1979 Stormwatch album.  The lyrics call for a meeting down by Dun Ringill during the wee hours of a stormy night, when \"we'll watch the old gods play.\" The song was written by Tull leader Ian Anderson, who lived at Kilmarie House, within walking distance of Dun Ringill, at the time.\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Scotland Blue Guide, A&C Black, London, 12th Edition, 2001, .\n Scotland an Oxford Archaeological Guide, Oxford University Press, 1998, \n The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39–43.

It is believed to be the site of a 6th century village that served as a stronghold of the Clan Donald during the Middle Ages. The fort was used to control the Sound of Sleat and control trade along the coastal routes. The fort is surrounded by a series of stone walls and deep trenches, and is located at the top of a rocky hill on the Strathaird peninsula. The name Dun Ringill derives from the Gaelic for \"fort of the little promontory\", as it was located on a rock overlooking the sea. The site has been occupied since prehistory, but it is its medieval history that is most visible today. The site was likely constructed in the 6th century AD to provide a fortified stronghold for members of the Clan Donald, spreading their control over the northern isles of Skye and Raasay. The walls, which date back to the early 5th century, are made of rough stones with foundations of hewn stone and earth. The walls are up to 7m tall, and are highly visible from surrounding areas due to the fort being situated on a hillside. The fort is thought to have been built to provide protection to the Clan Donald, who led a series of raiding parties against their Norse and Scandinavian enemies. The walls could have served both defensive and symbolic purposes, as they declared the Clan's presence and authority in the area. The fort was also likely used as a harbor where ships could dock and unload their goods, and is situated near the entrance to Kyle Rhea, a former sea route between Skye and the Scottish mainland. This would have made Dun Ringill a strategic place for trade, fishing and even smuggling. Today, Dun Ringill remains an impressive and atmospheric Iron Age fort. It has been used in films, music videos and documentaries, and is a popular destination for tourists visiting Skye. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest, with much of the masonry dating back to the Late Iron Age period. The fort is open to the public and the National Trust for Scotland has established an interpretation centre at the site to provide information about the history and cultural heritage of the site. Dun Ringill is an important reminder of Scotland's past and provides a unique insight into the history and culture of the region. It still stands as a testament to the power and authority of the Clan Donald.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18051066}

Born in 1913 in El Oued, Algeria, Mihoubi was a leader of the Algerian National Liberation Front and a founding member of the Revolutionary Council of Unity and Action (CRUA). Mihoubi was educated in France and was an early advocate of Algerian independence. After the eruption of the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962), Mihoubi was an active participant and advocate for Algerian freedom. As head of the Revolutionary Council of Unity and Action, Mihoubi organized and popularized the armed struggle against French colonialism. His recruitment of young Algerian men for the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) made him a pivotal figure in the battle for Algerian independence. When independence was finally achieved in 1962, Mihoubi was appointed Minister of Information in Ben Bella's first government. He also held other important posts in the Algerian government, including chair of the Organisation de l’armée nationale algérienne (ONA) and Chief of Staff of the Algerian armed forces from 1965 to 1966. Mihoubi's contributions were widely recognized; in January 1962, he was awarded the Band of Honour of the FLN and in 1968, he was given the title of Deputy President of the Republic of Algeria. He also held various leadership posts and helped to draft the 1965 Constitution of Algeria. In the late 1968, Mihoubi was named Prime Minister in a transitional period before Houari Boumediene's rise to power. Mihoubi was, however, removed from his post after he took certain actions that Boumediene viewed as inappropriate. Mihoubi continued to exercise influence, however, serving as ambassador to several countries and remaining active in politics until the end of his life. He died in 1983 in Algiers at the age of 70 and was buried in El Oued. Hemza Mihoubi remains an important figure in Algerian history for his role in leading and advocating for Algerian independence.

Its studios are located southeast of the I-10/US 69 interchange in Beaumont, and its transmitter is located in Vidor, Texas.\n\nHistory\nThe FCC allocated 95.1 facility in Beaumont received an initial License to Cover on November 27, 1961 as KHGM, owned by Gerald Proctor under the entity of Woodland Broadcasting Company.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Petunia Pig\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Petunia Pig is an animated cartoon character in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks much like her significant other, Porky Pig, except that she wears a dress and has pigtailed black hair.\n\nBiography\nPetunia was introduced by animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short Porky's Romance. The film is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called Mickey's Nightmare. Whereas Mickey Mouse marries his longtime girlfriend Minnie in that film, Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughter of his porcine paramour. Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's entourage and featured her in two more cartoons: The Case of the Stuttering Pig and Porky's Double Trouble, both in 1937.\n\nBob Clampett was the only other Warner director to utilize Petunia after Tashlin left the studio in 1938. He first featured her in Porky's Picnic, a 1939 film that sees Porky tormented by his nephew Pinkie. Pinkie and Porky's encounters are always out of sight of Petunia, of course, so she blames Porky for everything that goes wrong as a result of Pinkie's activity. Petunia's largest role came in Clampett's 1939 short Naughty Neighbors. The film borrows elements from both the famous feud between the Hatfields and McCoys as well as Romeo and Juliet as Porky and Petunia's love for each other is stymied by their respective hillbilly families' mutual hatred. Despite her more prominent role in the short, Petunia is only a supporting character; Porky remains the star.\n\nAs Porky's popularity was eclipsed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by brasher characters like Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he was relegated to a supporting player himself in new Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. Petunia, already a bit player to Porky's lead, fared much worse. She still appeared occasionally in Warner's merchandising, but her tenure as a Warner Bros. player was mostly over.\n\nLater appearances\nNevertheless, in modern years Petunia has enjoyed multiple new roles:\n\n Petunia has a co-starring role in Filmation's lone Looney Tunes-related production, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies, in 1972. She is voiced by Jane Webb.\n Petunia made a cameo appearance in the 1979 short Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol as Mrs. Cratchit, wife of Bob Cratchit (played by Porky Pig), though she had no speaking lines.\n Originally Petunia intended to appear as a cameo with Porky in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\".\n Petunia made a cameo appearance in Tiny Toon Adventures in the episode \"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special\".\n An infant version of Petunia was a recurring character in the Baby Looney Tunes television series, where she was voiced by Chiara Zanni.\n The regular adult Petunia is an occasional guest star in DC's Looney Tunes comic book and appeared frequently in 2001-2005 webtoons on the official Looney Tunes website.\n She also turned up in Duck Dodgers, playing the role of Princess Incense (voiced by Jodi Benson).\n Petunia appeared on The Looney Tunes Show in the episodes \"Here Comes the Pig\" and \"Mr. Wiener\", voiced by Katy Mixon.\n Petunia  is a playable character in the mobile game \"Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem\", along with Farmer, Lunar, and Athena variants of herself. \n Petunia appears in several New Looney Tunes segments, voiced by Jessica DiCicco.\n Petunia also appears in Looney Tunes Cartoons, voiced by Lara Jill Miller, which for the first time she has a solo appearance. In this portrayal, she has a Brooklyn accent similar to Bugs Bunny.\n\nExternal links\nLeague of Comic Geeks page\nBehind the Voice Actors\n\nReferences\n\nPig, Petunia\nPig, Petunia\nFilm characters introduced in 1937\nFemale characters in animation", "machine_text": " Petunia Pig is a fictional character in the animated cartoon universe of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. She is generally a crime fighter and the love interest of Porky Pig, the protagonist of the series, who is often seen trying to rescue her in cartoons. Petunia is depicted as a beautiful young pig with golden yellow fur, long eyelashes, and a pink body with small, tanned spots. Petunia has occasionally worn accessories such as bows or ribbons, or had her snout painted when performing. She usually has a short, curly tail that sticks out from her rear end, and she was first drawn as having a wide mouth. Her personality is usually portrayed as kind, naive, and gentle. Petunia is sometimes seen working in a boutique shop and often shows herself to be an independent young woman of her time, even occasionally standing up to Porky and refusing his occasional proposals of marriage. However, whenever Porky is in trouble, Petunia can be counted on to protect and even occasionally save him. Petunia first appeared in the 1935 Warner Bros. cartoon I Haven't Got a Hat as a love interest of Porky Pig and his rival, a mouse character named Chizzling. After this, she starred and co-starred in many cartoons throughout the 1940s, such as The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos. Her last cartoon appearance was in 1954's Three Little Bops, her only appearance in the Rembrandt Films era. Throughout the decades, Petunia Pig has appeared in various comic books published by DC Comics and various other comic books, usually as a job or as a girlfriend of Porky Pig. She also appeared as a pal of Daisy Duck in various Disney comics. In 2003, a petunia pig stuffed toy became available as part of the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary Celebration. Petunia was voiced by several voice actresses in the Golden Age of American Animation, including Bea Benaderet, Ruth Clifford and then later by June Foray, Mel Blanc, and Trudy Hoyt. Since the mid-2000s, Petunia Pig has become a popular mascot for various companies, from fashion brands to radio stations. She is occasionally seen making appearances at Warner Bros. related events, such as the opening of theLooney Tunes store on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. To this day, Petunia Pig remains one of the most recognizable cartoon animals of all time.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 418422}

The programme has been narrated by Brian Protheroe since 2015.\n\nProduction\nThe programme was filmed at the Paternoster Chop House restaurant in Paternoster Square, Central London from 2013 to 2020, showing many people on dates, all of whom have not met each other before. At the end of the date, the couples are interviewed together and asked whether they would like to see each other again. The restaurant is closed to the public while filming takes place. The restaurant is fitted with 42 \"Pan–tilt–zoom\" cameras and there are at least 70 crew members on set during filming, which lasts 15 hours a day. Each diner is given £25 towards the cost of their meal.\n\nThe spin-off show, First Dates Hotel, follows the same TV format with contestants meeting for the first time in a hotel restaurant, but if the date goes well, the couples are offered the opportunity to check-in for the night. The first series was filmed at Le Vieux Castillon in Castillon-du-Gard[2] offering idyllic settings with a variety of activities for the successful second daters, and added sommelier Xavier Chapelou to Fred Sirieix's team. The second series was filmed at Aquapetra Resort & Spa in Campania near Naples, Italy.\n\nIn 2020 it was announced that filming would move to Manchester for Series 16.

The premise of the show was that couples went on a first date, and the viewers were given a revealing insight into the different attitudes, thoughts and behaviours of the prospective couples. The aim of the show was to discover whether each couple had a genuine connection during their date or if they were just not compatible. As of 2021, the show is in its eighth series. The show is created and produced by Twenty Twenty, a British production company founded by Martin Scott and Clare Bennett. First Dates is presented by comedian Paddy McGuinness and ex-model and actress Sarah-Jane Crawford; both were included in the show’s sixteenth series. Regular commentators on the series include relationship guru (and celebrity matchmaker) Nadia Essex, neuroscientist and human behaviour professor Emma Kenny, and psychologist Dr. Dawn Harper. The show's restaurant is located in Finchley, North London. It is a dedicated, purpose-built restaurant complex which includes a themed bar, a garden and a Love Lift to transport dates to the restaurant. It was reported by the Evening Standard in 2014 that the restaurant has served over 60,000 meals during the show's first series. The show's format provides a platform to explore various themes within the dating process. For instance, romantic chemistry, opportunities to discover more about each person, preconceptions, confidence, attitudes towards love and relationships, as well as any potential difficulties or surprises. In addition, there are regular features such as success stories, embarrassing stories, tips from celebrity daters, and fashion tips from stylist and make-up artist Alex Babsky. The series has been generally well received by critics. The Guardian praised the format for its \"rousing mixture of warmth, humour and poignancy\", while Radio Times dubbed it \"Saturday night televisual pleasure\". Viewers have also been impressed, with First Dates gaining a dedicated fanbase on social media and even becoming a trending topic on Twitter during its airing. Though its chaotic and often unpredictable format may make it feel more like an entertainment show than a serious social experiment, First Dates certainly has value in its realistic portrayal of the dating experience. It has opened viewers’ eyes to the various dynamics involved in the process of looking for love and possibly gaining a deeper understanding of why people do what they do when it comes to romance.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42330862}

With considerable moral ambiguity, it tells the story of a committed policeman in a crooked force who concludes that the only way to avenge the murder of a colleague by criminals is to use their own weapons of beatings and shootings. Its portrayal of police corruption and violence led to demands from French government ministers for extensive cuts or a total ban and in the end the French release had a few cuts.\n\nPlot\nInspector Favenin, after being posted away for indiscipline, returns to duty and links up with his old friend Barnero. The two start investigating the murder of Dassa, a bar owner who refused to let his premises be used for distributing the drugs of Tavernier, the local crime lord who is protected by police and politicians. When Dassa's sister arrives to settle his affairs, the goons who murdered her brother beat her up and wreck the bar. \n\nRover, an old friend of Dassa, hides the girl on his stud farm and decides to get revenge. He enlists Villetti, a fellow ex-mercenary, to murder Tavernier as he leaves his private gambling club. An alibi is secured from a third colleague, Aulnay, who will swear that the two were playing cards with him and his wife. Rover and Villetti succeed in murdering Tavernier but, as they escape along the roof, encounter Favenin and Barnero. The warning shots of the two policemen are returned and Barnero is killed.\n\nWhen Favenin's demand to lead the hunt for the killer in his own way is accepted, he first tracks down the two goons who were also in the club. After shooting one for failure to co-operate, he gets the name of Villetti from the other. Tracking down Villetti, he explains to him that the only sure way to get revenge will be to shoot him. Villetti agrees, but points out before the trigger is pulled that this makes Favenin no better than a criminal. Meanwhile the police have tracked down and arrested Rover, who gives nothing away despite being beaten. Favenin tracks down Aulnay, who persists in the false alibi despite a beating. \n\nAfter this trail of beatings and deaths, Favenin is again suspended and, sending his wife away to safety, stays alone in his riverside home. Aulnay tracks him down and informs both Rover, who is in jail pending trial, and Dassa's sister. The girl goes to confront Favenin, but both are unaware that Rover has escaped. Guessing where he will be heading, a srong force of police surround Favenin's house. When the armed Rover confronts Favenin, police fire brings him down.

The film follows a police officer who is trying to solve the murder of a young woman while also maintaining order in the streets. The film was shot on location in East Los Angeles with a minimal budget. It is set in the streets of a run-down neighbourhood and follows a police officer by the name of Jim Belushi (Adam Roarke). Belushi is a no-nonsense cop trying to maintain some law and order during tumultuous times in the predominantly Mexican and African-American neighbourhood. One evening while on patrol, Jim hears screaming and calls for back-up. Upon arrival at the scene, he discovers the body of a young woman and immediately takes action. As he investigates her death, a number of obstacles arise, from corrupt cops and local gangsters to drug dealers and other seedy characters. In his effort to uncover the truth and bring the guilty to justice, Belushi must grapple with his own personal demons as well as an unreliable justice system. The Cop features a tight-knit cast including Kathleen Crowley as Alma, Belushi’s love interest who works as a waitress at a local diner, Jorge Casal as Paco, the local gang leader who provides Jim with crucial information, and Phil Fischer as Dave, a crooked cop who may be involved in the murder. The film was released in the United States on March 19, 1970. It had a limited theatrical release and garnered some positive reviews, particularly for Roarke’s performance. The Cop was intended as a tribute to the LAPD officers who worked in East Los Angeles during the late 1960s. It was distributed by Fonda-Lamarr Productions, an independent film company created by Peter Fonda and Susan Strasberg. The Cop is a gritty and compelling crime drama that explores themes of justice, morality, and loyalty in an inner-city neighbourhood. Its gritty realism, excellent performances, and strong direction create an immersive experience that captures both the despair and beauty of the area. It remains a cult classic for fans of low-budget crime films and the independent film movement.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19112806}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Heirs of Empire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Heirs of Empire is a 1996 military science fiction novel by American writer David Weber. It is the third novel in the Dahak trilogy, after the de facto duology of Mutineers' Moon and The Armageddon Inheritance. Heirs of Empire is a stand-alone work that focuses on the adventures and travails of the fraternal twin children of Emperor Colin MacIntyre (who defeated the eponymous mutineers and the Achuultani incursion in  The Armageddon Inheritance) and their three friends. In 2003, it was republished in the omnibus volume, Empire from the Ashes.\n\nPlot summary \n\nThe story opens approximately 20 years after The Armageddon Inheritance. The human race has largely recovered from the Siege of Earth by the Achuultani and the Bia system is being slowly re-colonized and its defenses re-activated. In short, the Empire is largely at peace, busy assimilating the technological advances of the Fourth Empire and building and manning a fleet to take the war back to the Achuultani and the master computer controlling them. The captured Achuultani have prospered; with the aid of cloning, their ranks have swollen and they have colonized a planet called Narhan, which was unsuitable to humans by reason of its heavy gravity - for this reason they have renamed themselves the Narhani. They are fervently loyal to the reborn Empire and Colin, enraged by the perversion of their race by the master computer. Brashieel's clone-child (Brashieel is now the head Narhani) Brashan, is one of Sean and Harriet MacIntyre's closest friends (Sean and Harriet being Colin and Jiltanith's two children).\n\nThe only flies in the ointment are the worrying fact that some of Anu's agents remain at large, and that a small but increasingly violent faction that considers the Narhani to be minions of the anti-christ and want to kill all Narhani; these two factions are secretly working against the Emperor.\n\nInto this volatile situation step Sean, Harry, Brashan, Sandy (daughter of Hector MacMahan and Ninhursag), and Tamman (the son of Amanda Tsien and Tamman), who have all enlisted in Battle Fleet.\n\nAfter graduation from the Academy, the four depart on a newly constructed planetoid warship, Imperial Terra, for their midshipman cruise. Unbeknownst to them, one of Anu's former minions, Lawrence Jefferson, had worked his way up to Lieutenant Governor of Earth, and has commenced his plan to become Emperor through assassinating everyone ahead of him in the line of succession. Under his instructions, Jefferson's personal band of religious terrorists, \"The Sword of God\", takes one of the planetoid's programmer's family hostage, and order him to sabotage Imperial Terra. The task is accomplished, and the programmer and his family are all murdered to cover it up.\n\nThe Imperial Terra departs on its maiden voyage, but partway through deliberately loses control of its core tap, as the dead programmer had instructed. However, Dahak had surreptitiously inserted a command with equal priority to the sabotage command which states that the lives of 2 certain midshipmen and their friends must be preserved. Imperial Terra reconciles these conflicting orders by first jettisoning the four aboard a well-stocked and capable (but not FTL-capable) battleship moderately near some uncharted systems and only then destroying itself and its crew of 80 thousand.\n\nLater, Sandy, Harry, Brashan, Sean, and Tamman arrive at the nearest potentially inhabited system. They barely survive the onslaught of a quarantine system, and decide to sneak onto the life-bearing world the space-borne Imperial weaponry seem to be protecting.  Amazingly, it seems that the bio-weapon that had killed the Fourth Empire had missed this world.\n\nAfter landing and investigating the ruins of a high-tech enclave, the five piece together the true history of the planet the indigenous inhabitants call \"Pardal\".\n\nOnce, Pardal had been an out-of-the-way minor planet of the Empire. Because it was out of the way, its governor managed to shut down the mat-trans system before Pardal was infected by the bio-weapon when the first warnings went out across the hypercoms, and also to devise with her chief engineer an extremely effective quarantine system. However, even as they hunkered down behind their orbital defenses, the hypercom  continued to operate \"like a comlink to hell\" (pg 255), broadcasting the prolonged death of the Empire, and even more devastatingly, messages from worlds like Pardal which were fooled by the bio-weapon's long incubation period into thinking they were safe. The horrified backlash by Pardal's populace centered on destroying Pardal's technological infrastructure, and erasing all scientific accomplishment and knowledge more advanced than the Dark Ages, so another such horror could never arise. The civil and military authorities concentrated on creating a global theocracy (reminiscent of the Catholic Church) dedicated to the suppression of technological advancement and to the maintenance of the quarantine system.\n\nThe high-tech enclave the old records were retrieved from was permitted to exist to serve as a source of demons and to provide the fledgling church an easy enemy.\n\nHarriet had been sent back to the shuttle to bring it to the valley so they could airlift the enclave's computer out, but along the way she was shot down by some locals. They were about to burn her alive for associating with the \"Valley of the Damned\" when Sean and the rest, frightened them and destroyed a portion of the village (without killing anyone) and rescuing her.\n\nThe local priest becomes convinced that the intruders were actually angels, as Pardalian angels are female, beautiful, wound-able, speak in the language of the Empire (the priestly language on Pardal), killed no one (an odd restraint, were they \"damned demons\"), wore imperial military uniforms, and were immune to Father Stomald's various religious attacks and banishments. He begins preaching to the populace, converting a fair proportion.\n\nThe Church reacts quickly and violently, sending a portion of the very well equipped \"Temple Guard\" to burn the heretics.\n\nStomald's forces are outnumbered and outgunned (the Church possesses a monopoly on heavy artillery) and surely doomed. The five castaways discuss matters, and decide that their guilt in instigating this little rebellion, kickstarting the modernization of Pardal, and also gaining access they need to the quarantine system's main computer could all be accomplished by supporting the rebellion with their leadership and knowledge of how to revolutionize Pardalian warfare. The initial Guard expedition is repulsed and scattered by a miracle accomplished through Imperial technology (see Clarke's Third Law). This victory attracts even more recruits to their cause, such as a good proportion of the now-unarmed Guard force they defeated.\n\nThe quasi-country the revolt began in, the Princedom of Malagor, has long been known for its independent spirit and its rifles; it had long chafed under the Church's studied oppression of it and its artisans. With the new rifles (on Pardal, smoothbore guns and pikes made up most of an army. Rifles took far too long to load despite their greater accuracy and range, because balls had to be rammed down the barrel; with the \"angels\"' introduction of the Minié ball, this issue became moot) the army is considerably superior to conventional Pardalian armies. Other technology, such as bayonet rings, modern meteorology, satellite cartography, and canister shot, further increase the rebels advantage .\n\nThe Battle of Yortown, in which the massed Guard reinforcements charged a fortified Angel's army position, quite effectively demonstrated this through the slaughter of the aggressors. Sean's lack of boldness in the counter-stroke followup allowed the surviving Guard commander, named Ortak, to retreat to Erastor, a well-fortified position placed like a choke-point between Malagor and the Temple. Unfortunately, Sean's many advantages are largely nullified in a siege, so he conceives a strike to Ortak's rear, seizing Ortak's semaphore communication lines to perform a man in the middle attack and gain time. Sean managed to bring enough men around Ortak's impassable swamp-secured flank to launch a pincer attack on Ortak's rear and front. With Ortak's forces shattered, the Angels' Army moves out into the open country of Aris, where they can bypass fortifications and crush any  army foolish enough to engage.\n\nThey march clear to the Temple, but are stymied by its elaborate fortifications.  Sean's army is ideal for defeating other armies, but not for fighting a siege. The Council offers to meet with Sean to discuss a truce, offering as surety one of its own members and allowing Sean to bring a large contingent in with him. Sean walks straight into their trap, and begins fighting his way to the actual Template/computer complex with his men, while Sandy and the others task the main army with breaking in to relieve Sean.  Brashan circles the conflict 100 kilometers away in the Imperial equivalent of a fighter jet, unable to do anything while the quarantine system's defense guns are operational.\n\nFierce fighting gets Sean within range of the computers; as crown prince and heir to the Imperial throne, he has all sorts of overrides and security codes. He shuts down the defenses, and Brashan defeats the Temple forces, ending the war.\n\nThe next time they are heard from is a few years later, when Dahak receives a message via their newly constructed hypercom. The Emperor and Empress are overjoyed to hear from the two whom they had long thought dead (thought it sincerely enough that they had had two more children). They had not rested in the meantime, defusing Jefferson's plan to kill all the people in the succession via a massive gravitonic bomb planted in a Narhani statue (intending to use his perversion of their gift as a way to blame them), and foiling his attempt on Jiltanith and Horus's life, at the cost of Horus.\n\nAfter this message, Colin and company, along with Dahak, immediately embark for Pardal, eager to see their children as the main effort to crush the xenophobic computers holding the Achuultani hostage begins to take form.\n\nExternal links \n An excerpt of Heirs of Empire is available for download or reading online at the Baen Free Library  here.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Casablanca (novella)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Casablanca is a novella written by Edgar Brau in Nevada, United States, in November–December 2002. In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Café Américain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie  Casablanca.\n\nPlot summary\nCasablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Café Américain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing \"As Time Goes By\"  on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there.\n\nIt all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to  Sydney Greenstreet —the actor who interpreted señor Ferrari— decides to build a replica of Rick's café to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose, he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Señor Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey.\n\nWhen the café is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are “inside” the famous movie. Señor Ferrari's dream (“Ferrari” is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Señor Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true.\n\nSome years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Señor Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Perón to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Perón —who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) — agrees to it.\n\nThe café manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Perón, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the café will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale.\n\nIn the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while, some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by.\n\nTime passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins.\n\nMeanwhile, the storm has subsided.  Sam plays \"As Time Goes By\" once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place.\n\nBackground\nIn 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno, as visiting professor and writer-in-residence for the fall 2002 – spring 2003. As writer-in-residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said:\n\n“I started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said”.\n\nSo, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November–December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe.\n\nMain characters\nSeñor Ferrari A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Señor Ferrari.\n\nSam He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Señor Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella.\n\nRick Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind.\n\nIlsa Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Señor Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and protégée. In the story, Sam calls her “Elsa”.\n\nUgarte Before being hired by Señor Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nFortunato A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick.\n\nThe Narrator Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession.\n\nTheme\n\nThe novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that “Europeans in exile” (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled “Europe”.\n\nThe splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980.\n\nIn the novella, the coup d´état which overthrew President Perón in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca —which had already been “hurt” by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease—. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other “Casablanca”, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when José Félix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hipólito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly.\n\nThe novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life.\n\nTranslation into English\nThe translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.\n\nSee also\n History of Argentina\n\nReferences\n\n The Washington Post: “For the first time in English, the Argentine labyrinths of Edgar Brau”, by Michael Dirda.

The story is set in the Moroccan city of Casablanca, and follows an aging artist named Daniel, who is living in a once-grand home that he inherited from his father. Daniel is struggling to come to terms with his past and the things that have been left unsaid between himself, his family, and his ex-wife. The story weaves together vivid descriptions of Casablanca's old and new, examining class and race differences, as well as nostalgia and the complexities of relationships. It also delves deeply into the heart of the city and its culture; not only does Daniel explore these issues through his interactions with the locals, but through brooding and vivid flashbacks as well. Daniel eventually finds himself, or rather rediscovers himself, through his newfound connection with his ex-wife's daughter, Lucia. Their conversations bring to light the personal struggles, heartache, and potential of a city and a society that is at once on the precipice of change and yet still clinging to its past and the promise of a brighter future. The story was well received when it was first published and was praised for its honest and heartfelt depiction of a city and its people. In addition to exploring complicated racial and class systems, Casablanca (novella) is a warm and insightful study of relationships, hopes, and joys that come with living in a capital city of culture and rich history. Overall, Casablanca (novella) captures the stunning beauty and deeply felt emotions of a sprawling, vibrant city and its inhabitants in a unique and striking way.

He was, however, also active in the fields of pathology and psychosomatic medicine. Born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, Parkinson graduated from Cambridge University in 1923, and went on to earn his MB BCh from the University of Liverpool in 1926. Becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1929, he remained a practising doctor in Liverpool until 1944. In 1935, Parkinson published a paper on a condition of the nervous system, which he termed 'paralysis agitans', which would later be changed to Parkinson's Disease after him. He noticed that this condition was associated with a degeneration of neurons in the area of the midbrain of some of his patients, and described rigidity, tremor, and slow movement in the afflicted. Parkinson also wrote on topics such as noise-induced deafness, multiple personality, hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy, and thorax and laryngeal cancer. He also wrote on problems of aging and mental illness, and was an outspoken advocate for mental health during this time period. Moving to Australia in 1944, Parkinson worked at the University of Melbourne until his retirement in 1967. During his time in Australia, he was the founding medical director of the Prince Henry Hospital and later of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Victoria. After a long and renowned career, Parkinson died in Melbourne on the 23rd of May, 1983. Following his death, he was posthumously awarded the C. J.

In 2006, a bronze bust of Parkinson was unveiled at Royal Melbourne Hospital, in recognition of his contribution to medicine. Legacy Despite the more than 4 decades that have passed since his death, Parkinson remains a highly acclaimed figure in the field of Neurology, with the eponymous neurologic condition that he identified in 1935 having affected numerous patients all over the world. His contribution to the fields of pathology, psychosomatic medicine, mental health, and aging remain unrivaled to this day.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46764299}

It is the largest city in the province, located at 832 kilometres from Buenos Aires and 130 kilometres from the provincial capital, Posadas. With a population of around 81,000 inhabitants (according to the 2010 census), it is the third most populated city in the Mesopotamian Region after Posadas and Oberá. Apóstoles, formerly known as San Pedro Misiones, is built along the banks of the Uruguay river and is the point of convergence of the three main highways that connect the northwest of Misiones with the rest of the country. This makes the city a pole of attraction in the area, being practically the only urban center between Posadas and the Paraguayan cities. In Apóstoles there is a wide range of tourist attractions, such as the Iguazú River Tour, the Swim Park, the Cellar Museum, the Port of Apóstoles, the Lover's Park, the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Piedras Encimadas Hills. The city's main project is the Project of the Apóstoles Port, which aims to facilitate the navigation between the Argentine and Paraguayan ports. The project consists of two port complexes, one of which receives cargo and cargo vessels, and the other that receives passenger boats. Apóstoles is home to multiple sports and entertainment venues, including two soccer stadiums, two basketball courts and two tennis courts. The city is also home to an important convention and exhibition center, which holds a number of national and international events every year. A large section of the city is currently working on green projects, aiming to transform Apóstoles into an eco-city. The project includes the construction of a recycling plant, solar energy generation and reforestation of the banks of the Uruguay river. The city's economy is mainly based on agriculture, livestock and tourism, but recently there have been some industrial projects that have been initiated with the aim of further diversifying the economic activity of the city. Apóstoles remains one of the main urban centers in Misiones, and its efficient network of public transport and its proximity to Paraguay makes it an attractive destination for tourists from all over the world.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6488319}

The Bosnian TO was gained control by the Bosnian-Serb SDS in the coalition government. On 19 December 1990 Alija Izetbegović and the SDA party alarmed by the SDS's secessionists attitudes discussed forming an independent Bosnian army later Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In March 1991 Sefer Halilović formed the Patriotic League (Patriotska Liga - PL) as an independent Bosnian army, with the same territorial organization as the TO.\n\nIt was in early 1992 that the JNA, Bosnian-Serb and Serbian paramilitary militias began attacking Bosnian-Muslim and Bosnian-Croat towns and villages the first ones being Sarajevo by the JNA and Bijeljina by paramilitary forces. On 4 April, Alija Izetbegović ordered general mobilization: and on 8 April he transformed the Sarajevo TO command into GHQ of the Teritorijalna Odbrana Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) (TORBIH), appointing the Bosnian-Muslim Colonel Hasan Efendić as commander of the army, Colonel Stjepan Šiber, a Bosnian-Croat, became chief-of-staff, and Colonel Jovan Divjak, a Bosnian-Serb, his deputy. The TO was formally established on 15 April when all Patriotic League units joined the force. On 20 May 1992 the TORBIH, PL, and other militias and the Bosnian-Croat HVO and HOS were officially united as Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (Oruzane Snage Republike Bosne i Hercegovine). On 23 May Colonel Efendić was replaced as commander by Sefer Halilović.\n\nArmy of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nOn 20 May 1992 the TORBIH was renamed Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) - ARBIH, usually abbreviated ABIH. In November 1993, Sefer Halilović was replaced as commander of ABIH by Rasim Delić.\n\nOrganization 1992–1994\n\nThe ARBIH, now around 80,000 strong was reorganized on 18 August 1992 into a more conventional structure. Initially four corps were created: 1st Corps (Sarajevo); 2nd Corps (Tuzla) in northern Bosnia; 3rd Corps (Zenica) and 4th Corps (Mostar) in Herzegovina; the Eastern Bosnian Operational Group in the eastern enclaves of Goražde. 5th Corps (Bihać) was established on 21 October 1992 from the Una-Sana Operational Group to defend the North-Western Bosnian enclave. The 7th Corps (Travnik) was established on 7 April 1994 with brigades from the 3rd Corps to advance north-westward through southern Bosnia. The 6th Corps (Konjic) was formed in June 1993 from the 4th Corps Northern Herzegovina Operational Group, to occupy northern Hercegovina from the HVO and eventually reach the Adriatic coast.\n\nEach corps controlled a number of brigades, independent battalions and companies. Brigades were designed as infantry, mountain, motorized or light and given new three digit numbers, the first number indicating the corps. The larger corps (1st, 2nd and 3rd) comprised 15 Operationa Groups, each with 3–7 brigades. From August 1992 to December 1994 about 105 brigades were formed or reformed in the 1-527 series: 48 infantry or undesigned, 41 mountain, 10 motorized and 6 light, but not all brigades existed at the same time. There were also single commando and reconnaissance, Military Police battalions and artillery brigades: the various independent units included the Delta SF Unit, four commando detachments, six Corps HQ MP battalions, a mixed artillery battalion and an independent armoured company. Eight Bosnian-Croat HVO units were incorporated into the ABIH. Crni Labudovi was a PL unit formed in April 1992 from refugees in Konjic under the 4th Corps (later 1st Corps), they eventually numbered 800 men and earned a reputation for battlefield bravery.\n\nSome PL units after the absorption by the TORBIH still operated independently. PL personnel wore \"Green Berets\" as did many ABIH units. The ABIH assigned 15 mixed aircraft to corps HQs to supply 5th corps in Bihac and 2nd corps in the Goražde, Srebrenica and Žepa area. The Bosnian Police (Policija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine) were formed in 1992 from districts under Bosnian control and there was a Bosnian Special Police Unit (specijalna jedinica). There were no naval forces.\n\nOrganization 1995\nIn January 1995 the ARBIH now expanded to 200,000 reorganized. The Operational Groups in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th Corps were redesigned as divisions, each division comprising 3–6 brigades, but the 4th and 5th Corps kept their brigades and structure.

It originated from the Yugoslav People's Army's (JNA) Bosnian Serb force known as the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) forces who, together with Bosnian Croats, who left the VRS, joined the newly created ARBiH in 1992. The ARBiH was formed during the Bosnian War in response to a request by the Bosnian government for military assistance. The first units were formed during a mass mobilization at the beginning of the war, in April 1992. It was closely linked to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, therefore, it often preferred the designation of the \"Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". The army's first significant success came in February 1994, when it recaptured the town of Tuzla from Bosnian Serb forces on 23 February. Throughout the war, the Army also maintained its identity and remained loyal to the government. It was able to prevent forced displacement of Bosnia's non-Serb population, win important battles, and proved to be one of the key factors in ending the war. It was regularly the only force that opposed the VRS in the field, so for the vast majority of the war, it was in a very difficult position. Despite this, its contribution to the war effort was recognized and appreciated both by the people in Bosnia, as well as international forces. Nevertheless, the Army had serious problems which often obstructed its effective functioning. One of the main issues was the lack of unified headquarters as commanders of various levels often worked independently of each other. This made it challenging to effectively organize troops, coordinate strategies and strategies and deploy troops. Nevertheless, during the war the ARBiH maintained its loyalty and fought bravely in numerous engagements to protect Bosnia and Herzegovina. After a peace agreement was signed in 1995, the Army began to slowly adapt to the post-war context. In 2004 the decision was made to transition the ARBiH into the armed forces of a newly established independent state. The modernization of the Army then became a priority for the government, which focused on modernizing equipment and training. Today, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a modern, professional force and has become a mainstay of the country’s defense and one of the main forces in peacekeeping efforts worldwide. The ARBiH is currently a part of NATO’s relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina and regularly participates in international peacekeeping operations whenever needed.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13700475}

The season marked the final season of play for Løv-Ham Fotball, who were disbanded at the end of it due to financial difficulties. The 2001 Toppserien season was also the last season before the introduction of league playoffs. This system was adopted the following season and has been in operation ever since. The Toppserien, along with the 1.Divisjon and the 2.Divisjon, are all part of the Eliteserien, the top tier of Norwegian women's football. The Eliteserien is managed by the Football Association of Norway.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13472721}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pennine Way\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for  from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the \"backbone of England\". Although not the United Kingdom's longest National Trail (this distinction belongs to the  South West Coast Path), it is according to The Ramblers \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States of America, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the Daily Herald in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman's Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately  section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.\n\nThe Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series The Pennine Way was broadcast throughout April.\n\nUsage\n\nThe Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed £2 million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.\n\nAccommodation is available at Youth Hostels, camp sites, B&Bs and pubs but are limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.\n\nThere are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.\n\nMost of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.\n\nRoute\n\nA survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges.  of the route is on public footpaths,  on public bridleways and  on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.\n\nPeak District National Park\n\nThe Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail  away.\n\nFrom Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.\n\nSouth Pennines\n\nFrom Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire–Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about  west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.\n\nThe trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.\n\nFrom Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.\n\nYorkshire Dales National Park\n\nNorth of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle–Carlisle Railway).\n\nThe Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle–Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.\n\nThe path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the  ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.\n\nFrom Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.\n\nNorth Pennines\n\nAt Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God's Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.\n\nFrom Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.\n\nFrom Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at  the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.\n\nThe trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.\n\nNorthumberland National Park and the Scottish border\n\nOutside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian's Wall. For the next  the route coincides with the Hadrian's Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap,  west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.\n\nFrom the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.\n\nThe last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is  long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.\n\nRecords\nThe record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15–17 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).\n\nThe fastest women's time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14–17 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12–15 September 2020.\n\nThe route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.\n\nFurther reading \n\nThe Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to £15,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.\nBarry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.\n\nImage gallery\n\nSee also\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPennine Way Official Site\nPennine Way Association\nPractical information for the walk\nMap of the Pennine Way in  segments\nPennine Way Companion Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\nThe Pennine Way Pint Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\n\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\nFootpaths in Northumberland\nFootpaths in the Scottish Borders\nFootpaths in West Yorkshire\nFootpaths in North Yorkshire\nFootpaths in Cumbria\nTourist attractions in County Durham\nPennines\nFootpaths in Derbyshire\nFootpaths in Yorkshire", "machine_text": " The Pennine Way is an upland footpath in England, with a total length of about 270 miles (430 km) from Derbyshire to Cumbria and Northumberland. It is one of Britain's most popular long-distance walks, and as such is a major National Trail, running from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm on the Anglo-Scottish border. The Pennine Way was created in 1965 by Tom Stephenson, a district officer of the Pennine National Park. Stephenson was inspired by Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides, works that guided the walkers along established routes including the Coast to Coast Walk and the front cover of the May 1965 edition of Walk magazine featured the route. The route follows limestone and sandstone uplands, following watersheds between rivers on each side of the hills, to the highest parts of the Pennines, in the North Pennines and the Peak District. Later sections are generally at lower altitude, until reaching the Cheviot Hills in Northumberland. Covering much of the sparsely populated moorlands and mountains of northern Britain, the Pennine Way is widely recognised in Britain as offering the ultimate challenge for long-distance hikers. Whilst it can be walked throughout the year, the height of the Pennines, combined with long-distance off-road sections, often makes the Pennine Way one of the most demanding treks in the UK. Terrain along the Pennine Way includes road, moor and forest sections, with stony paths, high rough pasture and trackless mires. Grisedale Tarn, in the Yorkshire Dales is a popular stopover, as is Kinder Downfall, the highest waterfall in the Peak District. Other features along the way include the reservoirs of the Upper and Lower Derwent, the limestone pavements of the South Pennines, the deep gorges of Swaledale, and Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland. The most heavily used section of the walk is between Standedge on the moors of the South Pennines and the Eden Valley near Kirkby Stephen. The route was extended to its current length in 2003 and as of 2012, one can obtain a Pennine Way Trail Guide from the Pennine Way National Trail website. The route can be broken down into seven sections for separate walkers, and includes both lowland and upland terrain. The Pennine Way is widely considered to be one of Britain's premier long distance footpaths and is a popular destination for regular and experienced walkers alike. With its unique combination of spectacular scenery, remote locations and physical challenge, the route attracts people from all over the UK and beyond.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 319178}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joseph H. Allen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an industrial businessman, an officer in the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.\n\nEarly life\nAllen was the son of John and Sarah Allen. His father was a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was originally from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old \"to carve out a fortune for himself\", as Sylvester put it in his History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in an auger factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.\n\nBefore the war\nAllen soon resumed his place in the auger factory in Connecticut, where he remained until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing augers. The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner's share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850.\n\nIn January 1851, Allen purchased the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial building in the area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory had a long history of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.\n\nThe factory was located on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was commonly used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.\n\nAllen reopened the company in 1859, having added machinery for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.\n\nPublic and armed service\n\nAllen's presence was noticeable within Brunswick. In March 1853, he presided over a meeting to incorporate the \"Church of the Disciples of Christ at the village of Millville\", now known simply as Church of the Disciples of Christ. That summer, a church building was erected at a cost of about $1,200. In 1856 Allen became the supervisor of Brunswick, a position he was reelected to once and held until 1857; he ran as a Whig. He was also elected justice of the peace in 1861, but he did not finish his term because he decided to serve in the Civil War; this time he ran as a Democrat, and remained one for the rest of his life.\n\nIn early 1862, the 125th Volunteer Infantry Regiment had been put together in Brunswick and a call by President Lincoln for more troops was answered by Allen that September. He enlisted in Company C of the 169th New York Volunteer Infantry and was chosen captain, having organized the company within six days. Most of the infantrymen came from Brunswick, though some came from surrounding towns. Residents of the town raised the money necessary to cover various \"bounties and expenses\" incurred by Allen's soldiers while en route to war.\n\nAllen participated in all the battles in which his regiment took part except a few minor ones, due to wounds he received in battle. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, the bones in his wrist were shattered, and he later incurred a flesh wound in the same wrist at the First Battle of Fort Fisher. He was also wounded in the leg near his ankle at Fort Fisher; the musket ball remained there until his death. While recovering from injuries, he was reassigned to New York to recruit new soldiers. He was promoted to the rank of major in June 1864, and, for \"meritorious conduct\" at Fort Fisher, he was recommended for promotion by President Lincoln and brevetted lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865.\n\nPost war and personal life\nAllen returned to Brunswick after the war and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.\n\nIn addition to holding the offices of justice of the peace and town supervisor, it is also said that Allen was one of the foremost supporters of education in the town. On July 6, 1847, he married Sarah H. Payne, daughter of David H. and Catharine C. Payne, of Hamden, Connecticut. The couple had two children: Sarah and Cornelia May.\n\nAllen died on April 24, 1884, and is buried in Eagle Mills Cemetery on Brunswick Road in Eagle Mills; his wife died in 1907 and is buried next to him. Based on insignia carved on his gravestone (specifically the Square and Compasses), Allen was a Mason.\n\nNotes\n\na.  In New York, a town supervisor is viewed by many to be equivalent to a mayor, but a supervisor is actually the presiding officer of the town council and is therefore part of the legislative branch; town governments in New York do not have an executive branch.\nb.  Eagle Mills is a hamlet (a small, unincorporated settlement) in the Town of Brunswick. It was previously known as Milltown and later Millville; both of these names are now defunct, though \"Milltown\" was hardly used to begin with.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n1821 births\nAmerican people of English descent\nAmerican people of Scottish descent\nPeople from Alburgh, Vermont\nPeople from Brunswick, New York\nNew York (state) Whigs\n19th-century American politicians\nNew York (state) Democrats\n1884 deaths\nUnion Army colonels", "machine_text": " Joseph H.

The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.\n\nCase\n\nHarkins and Cooper\nOn August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.\n\nOn October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \"homicidal violence,\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.\n\nRiemer and Robertson\n\nOver a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \"Mommy was in the trees.\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \"not nearly verbal enough\" to provide any information.\n\nPolice searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.\n\nIn the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \"I love you, Diana.\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.\n\nDue to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.\n\nIn February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle’s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\"\n\n2011 development\nOn March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer.

Mineral, Washington Murders refers to a spree of four murders of women that occurred in Mineral, Washington in the early 2010s. The victims were Ashley Exley, Katelynn Daymude, Elizabeth Greenfeld, and Julia Biryukova. The murders occurred over a period of three years and were attributed to a serial killer. In October 2010, Ashley Exley, a 26-year-old woman, was found dead in Mineral, Washington. She had been strangled to death and her remains had been discovered outside of town by a team of deer hunters. At the time of her death, Exley was pregnant and due to give birth. Police launched a large-scale investigation into her death but were unable to identify a suspect. In August 2013, Katelynn Daymude, a 22-year-old woman, was reported missing from Mineral. Her remains were discovered a week later outside of town by a search team. Her body had been beaten and her death was ruled a homicide. In February 2014, Elizabeth Greenfeld, a 24-year-old woman, was murdered in Mineral. She had been strangled to death and her body was discovered by a passerby. Police launched an investigation into her death but were unable to identify a suspect. In August 2017, Julia Biryukova, a 23-year-old woman, was reported missing from Mineral. Her remains were discovered several months later outside of town by a search team. Her death was also ruled a homicide. The four murders were eventually attributed to a serial killer who had become active in Mineral in 2010. The killer was never identified, though a reward was offered for information leading to their capture. The murders created a climate of fear in Mineral, with many residents avoiding going outside at night, and the murders remain unsolved. In April 2018, a memorial was erected in Mineral to remember the victims of the spree and to offer a sense of closure to the families and citizens of the town. The memorial was created by local artists and featured the names of the victims and a bronze sculpture of four eagles in flight, representing the women and their impossible freedom.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49293155}

The present grade II* listed Tetton House dates from 1790 and was enlarged and mainly rebuilt in 1924-6 by Hon. Mervyn Herbert (1882-1929) to the design of the architect Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel.\n\nHistory\n\nDyke\n \nThe Dyke family of Somerset uses the same arms as the ancient Dyke family which originated at Dykesfield, Cumberland, before the Norman Conquest of which branches later settled at Henfield in Sussex and at Cranbrook in Kent. Reginald de Dike of Cranbrook was Sheriff of Kent in 1355. Thomas Dyke (d.1632) of Cranbrook married Joan Walsh,  heiress of the manor of Horeham in the parish of Waldron in Sussex, which thus passed to the Dykes. The Dyke Baronetcy, of Horeham in the County of Sussex, was created in 1677 for Thomas Dyke, Commissioner of Public Accounts and a Member of Parliament for Sussex and East Grinstead. \n\nThomas Dyke (1591-1672) of Tetton, who married a certain Anna (1598-1630). His monumental brass survives on the wall of the Tetton Pew of Kingston St Mary Church, inscribed as follows:\n\"Here lye buried the bodyes of Thomas Dyke and Anna his wife.

(\"depart, traveller, and fare thee well, until we rise again\")\n\nThomas Dyke (1613-1689), Doctor of Medicine, son, whose monumental brass also survives on the wall of the Tetton Pew of Kingston St Mary Church. He proved his father's will dated 10 March 1671 at the Archdeaconry Court of Taunton on 24 June 1672. He married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Pepys, a daughter of John Pepys (1576-1652) of Ashtead and sister and eventual co-heiress of Edward Pepys. Without progeny. Secondly to Joanna Deane, possibly his servant, by whom he had an illegitimate son called Thomas Deane, of the Inner Temple, who later adopted his father's surname of Dyke, and died without progeny. \nThomas Dyke (d.1745) of Tetton. He was one of the sons of Edward I Dyke (will dated 1728) of Pixton, Somerset, by his wife Elizabeth Blackford (d.1736), a daughter of Richard Blackford of Dunster, Master in Chancery, and heiress of her cousin Henrietta Blackford (1725-1733), heiress of Holnicote.\nElizabeth Dyke (d.1753), daughter and sole heiress. She married Sir Thomas Acland, 7th Baronet (1722-1785) of Killerton in Devon and Petherton Park in Somerset. She was also the heiress of her childless uncle Edward II Dyke (d.1746)  of Pixton, the husband of Margaret Trevelyan, a daughter of Sir John Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet (1670–1755), of Nettlecombe in Somerset, and widow of Alexander Luttrell (1705-1737) of Dunster Castle. Edward's portrait survives in Dunster Castle. Elizabeth Dyke thus brought to her husband the estates of Tetton, Holnicote and Pixton, \"a splendid dowry\" worth about £30,000, and extending into 24 parishes. According to the marriage settlement Elizabeth and her husband were obliged to adopt the additional surname of Dyke.\n\nAcland\n\nThe Acland family originated in the 12th century at the estate of Acland, from which they took their name,  in the parish of Landkey, North Devon. In the opinion of the Devon historian Hoskins (1981), based on the family's early and repeated use of the Flemish firstname of Baldwin, the Acland  family probably  migrated to England from Flanders soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066.  Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591 – 1647)  moved his residence from Acland to Columb John, near Exeter, the former seat of his great-uncle Sir John Acland (died 1620), and soon after the family moved again to the adjoining estate  of Killerton where they built a grand country house, today the property of the National Trust.\n\nSir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1722–1785), who in 1745 married Elizabeth Dyke, the heiress of Holnicote, Pixton and Tetton. He was the eldest son and heir of Sir Hugh Acland, 6th Baronet (1697-1728) of Killerton in Devon, by his wife Cicely Wroth, eldest daughter and eventual sole heiress of Sir Thomas Wroth, 3rd Baronet (1674–1721), MP, of Petherton Park, Somerset. He served as Member of Parliament for Devon, 1746–1747, for Somerset, 1767–1768, and was High Sheriff of Somerset in 1751. He was a prominent member of the Westcountry gentry, and a famous staghunter who used as his hunting seats his wife's  Exmoor estates of Pixton and Holnicote. He kept his own pack of hounds, which had formerly been kept by the Dykes. He became forester or ranger of Exmoor under grant from the Crown and \"hunted the country in almost princely style. Respected and beloved by all the countryside, he was solicited at the same time to allow himself to be returned as member of Parliament for the counties of Devon and Somerset. He preferred, however, the duties and pleasures of life in the country, where he bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman\".\n\nHerbert\n\nHenry George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon (1772-1833), who inherited Tetton and Pixton as part of the marriage settlement on his marriage in 1796 to Elizabeth \"Kitty\" Acland, daughter of John Dyke Acland (1746-1778) by his wife Lady Harriet Fox-Strangways   (1750-1815), a daughter of Stephen Fox-Strangways, 1st Earl of Ilchester (1704-1776). John Dyke Acland was the son and heir apparent of the 7th Baronet by his marriage to Elizabeth Dyke, and was the father of Sir John Dyke Acland, 8th Baronet (d. 1785), who died aged 7. Lady Harriet died at Tetton in 1815. \nEdward Charles Hugh Herbert (1802-1852) of Tetton, MP for Callington, second son of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon by his wife Kitty Acland.

His whole household was struck down by scarlet fever, probably caused by bad drains and water supply, and his first wife and one of his daughters, 3 year-old Cecily, died there in May 1851, after which the family moved to Holnicote, which then burnt down, then to Sprydon, purchased by his father the 10th Baronet.  \nEdward Henry Charles Herbert (1837-1870), only surviving son, of Tetton, was murdered by brigands in Greece. \nDr. The Hon.

It is part of the civil parish of Kingston St Mary, and is situated approximately one mile south of Taunton town centre. The hamlet is situated on the southern boundary of the larger village of Kingston St Mary. It is part of the Rural Population area of Taunton Deane, which has a population of 23,266. Tetton is one of the most sparsely populated areas in Somerset, with census data from the 2001 Census indicating that it had a population of just 34 people. The hamlet is largely surrounded by agricultural land, with the nearby hamlet of Heasley Mill situated to its north, and the Taunton to Minehead railway line bordering the east of the settlement. It is accessed via a single road leading off the B3170 road at the north east end of Kingston St Mary. The local church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul and is part of the Kingston St Mary parish. The closest school is Holyrood Academy, which is situated in the nearby village of Bishops Hull. The hamlet's name is derived from Teodene's tun, which was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name was likely a reference to the local lord of the manor at the time, which may have been a man called Teodene or Theoden. Tetton has a long history of farming, with records indicating that the hamlet's fields were used for records indicating that the hamlet's fields were used for sheep grazing as far back as the 16th century. Much of the surrounding area is made up of rolling hills, although the land to the north and east is low-lying and is criss-crossed by meandering streams. Today, Tetton remains sparsely populated, with only a handful of small farms in the immediate area. Many of the farms are still utilised for livestock farming. The nearby village of Kingston St Mary provides the locals with amenities, including a post office, a public house and a village hall. Despite its rural location, Tetton is within easy reach of the larger towns of Taunton and Bridgwater, which both offer a wide range of shops, services, and leisure facilities. Tetton is an area of great beauty, with lovely sweeping hillside views, and a peaceful atmosphere. Despite its small size, the hamlet makes a great holiday destination due to its access to the countryside and its proximity to larger towns and cities.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44136977}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Huo Qubing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Huo Qubing (140 BC – 117 BC) was a Chinese military general and politician of the Western Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. He was the nephew of the general Wei Qing and Empress Wei Zifu (Emperor Wu's wife), and the half-brother of the statesman Huo Guang. Along with Wei Qing, he led a campaign into the Gobi Desert of what is now Mongolia to defeat the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, winning decisive victories such as the Battle of Mobei in 119 BC.\n\nEarly life\nHuo Qubing was an illegitimate son from the love affair between Wei Shaoer (), the daughter of a lowly maid from the household of Princess Pingyang (Emperor Wu's older sister), and Huo Zhongru (), a low-ranking civil servant employed there at the time.  However, Huo Zhongru did not want to marry a lower class serf girl like Wei Shaoer, so he abandoned her and went away to marry a woman from his home town instead.  Wei Shaoer insisted on keeping the child, raising him with help of her siblings.\n\nWhen Huo Qubing was around two years old, his younger aunt Wei Zifu, who was serving as an in-house singer/dancer for Princess Pingyang, caught the attention of the young Emperor Wu, who took her and her half-brother Wei Qing back to his palace in the capital, Chang'an.  More than a year later, the newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with Emperor Wu's first child, earning her the jealousy and hatred of Emperor Wu's then empress consort, Empress Chen.  Empress Chen's mother, Grand Princess Guantao (), then attempted to retaliate against Wei Zifu by kidnapping and attempting to murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman at the Jianzhang Camp (建章營, Emperor Wu's royal guards).  After Wei Qing was rescued by fellow palace guards led by his close friend Gongsun Ao (), Emperor Wu took the opportunity to humiliate Empress Chen and Princess Guantao by promoting Wei Zifu to a consort (夫人, a concubine position lower only to the Empress) and Wei Qing to the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (), Chief of Staff (), and Chief Councillor (), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants.  The rest of the Wei family were also well rewarded, including the decreed marriage of Wei Shaoer's older sister Wei Junru () to Emperor Wu's adviser, Gongsun He ().  At the time, Wei Shaoer was romantically engaged with Chen Zhang (), a great-grandson of Emperor Gaozu's adviser Chen Ping.  Their relationship was also legitimized by Emperor Wu through the form of decreed marriage. Through the rise of the Wei family, the young Huo Qubing grew up in prosperity and prestige.\n\nMilitary career\nHuo Qubing exhibited outstanding military talent even as a teenager.  Emperor Wu saw Huo's potential and made Huo his personal assistant.\n\nIn 123 BC, Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing from Dingxiang () to engage the invading Xiongnu, and appointed the 18-year-old Huo Qubing to serve as the Captain of Piaoyao () under his uncle, seeing real combat for the first time.  Although Wei Qing was able to kill or capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian (蘇建, father of the Han diplomat and statesman, Su Wu) and Zhao Xin (趙信, a surrendered Xiongnu prince) was outnumbered and annihilated after encountering the Xiongnu force led by Yizhixie Chanyu ().  Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting.  Due to the loss of this detachment, Wei Qing's troops did not earn any promotion, but Huo Qubing distinguished himself by leading a long-distance search-and-destroy mission with 800 light cavalrymen, killing the Chanyu's grandfather and over 2,000 enemy troops, as well as capturing numerous Xiongnu nobles.  A very impressed Emperor Wu then made Huo Qubing the Marquess of Champion () with a march of 2,500 households.\n\nIn 121 BC, Emperor Wu deployed Huo Qubing twice in that year against the Xiongnu in the Hexi Corridor.  During spring, Huo Qubing led 10,000 cavalry, fought through five Western Regions kingdoms within 6 days, advanced over 1,000 li over Mount Yanzhi (), killed two Xiongnu princes along with nearly 9,000 enemy troops, and captured several Xiongnu nobles as well as the golden statue used by Xiongnu as an artifact for holy rituals. For this achievement, his march was increased by 2,200 households. During the summer of the same year, Xiongnu attacked the Dai Commandery and Yanmen.  Huo Qubing set off from Longxi (modern-day Gansu) with over 10,000 cavalry, supported by Gongsun Ao, who set off from the Beidi Commandery (北地郡, modern-day Huan County, Gansu).  Despite Gongsun Ao failing to keep up, Huo Qubing travelled over 2,000 li without backup, all the way past Juyan Lake to Qilian Mountains, killing over 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers and capturing a dozen Xiongnu princes.  His march was then increased further by a 5,400 households for the victory.\n\nHuo Qubing's victories dealt heavy blows to the tribes of the Xiongnu princes of Hunxie () and Xiutu () that occupied the Hexi Corridor.  Out of frustration, Yizhixie Chanyu wanted to mercilessly execute those two princes as punishment. The Prince of Hunxie contacted the Han government in autumn of 121 BC to negotiate a surrender. Failing to persuade his fellow prince to do the same, he killed the Prince of Xiutu and ordered Xiutu's forces to also surrender.  When the two tribes went to meet the Han forces, Xiutu's forces rioted.  Seeing the situation changed, Huo Qubing alone headed to the Xiongnu camp. There, the general ordered the Prince of Hunxie to calm his men and stand down before putting down 8,000 Xiongnu men who refused to disarm, effectively quelling the riot.  The Hunxie tribe was then resettled into the Central Plain.  The surrender of the Xiutu and Hunxie tribes stripped Xiongnu of any control over the Western Regions, depriving them of a large grazing area.  As a result, Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct trade access to Central Asia.  This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army.  Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor. He colonised the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier-settlers.\n\nAfter the series of defeats by Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Yizhixie Chanyu took Zhao Xin's advice and retreated with his tribes to the north of the Gobi Desert, hoping that the barren land would serve as a natural barrier against Han offensives.  Emperor Wu however, was far from giving up, and planned a massive expeditionary campaign in 119 BC.  Han forces were deployed in two separate columns, each consisting of 50,000 cavalry and over 100,000 infantry, with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing serving as the supreme commander for each.\n\nEmperor Wu, who had been distancing Wei Qing and giving the younger Huo Qubing more attention and favour, hoped that Huo would engage the stronger Chanyu's tribe and preferentially assigned him the most elite troopers.  The initial plan called for Huo Qubing to attack from Dingxiang (定襄, modern-day Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia) and engage the Chanyu, with Wei Qing supporting him in the east from Dai Commandery (代郡, modern-day, Yu County, Hebei) to engage the Left Worthy Prince ().  However, a Xiongnu prisoner of war confessed that the Chanyu's main force was at the east side.  Unaware that this was actually false information provided by the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu ordered the two columns to switch routes, with Wei Qing now setting off on the western side from Dingxiang, and Huo Qubing marching on the eastern side from the Dai Commandery.\n\nBattles at the eastern Dai Commandery theatre were quite straightforward, as Huo Qubing's forces were far superior to their enemies.  Huo Qubing advanced over 2,000 li and directly engaged the Left Worthy Prince in a swift and decisive battle.  He quickly encircled and overran the Xiongnu, killing over 70,000 men, and capturing three lords and 83 nobles, while suffering a 20% casualty rate that was quickly resupplied from local captives.  He then went on to conduct a series of rituals upon his arrival at the Khentii Mountains (狼居胥山, and the more northern 姑衍山) to symbolize the historic Han victory, then continued his pursuit as far as Lake Baikal (), effectively annihilating the Xiongnu clan and allowing conquering tribe such as the Donghu People to retake back their land to establish their own confederacy to declared independent from Xiongnu Overlord following the subjugation for over a few decade.  A separate division led by Lu Bode (), set off on a strategically flanking route from Right Beiping (右北平, modern-day Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia), joined forces with Huo Qubing after arriving in time with 2,800 enemy kills, and the combined forces then returned in triumph.  This victory earned Huo Qubing 5,800 households of fiefdom as a reward, making him more distinguished than his uncle Wei Qing. At the height of his career, many low-ranking commanders previously served under Wei Qing voluntarily transferred to Huo Qubing's service in the hope of achieving military glory with him.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nEmperor Wu offered to help Huo Qubing build up a household for marriage. Huo Qubing, however, answered that \"the Xiongnu are not yet eliminated, why should I start a family?\" (匈奴未滅，何以家為？), a statement that became an inspirational Chinese patriotic motto.  Though Huo Qubing was recorded as a quietly spoken man of few words, he was far from humble. Sima Qian noted in Shiji that Huo Qubing paid little regard to his men, refusing to share his food with his soldiers, and regularly ordering his troops to conduct cuju games despite them being short on rations. When Emperor Wu suggested him to study The Art of War by Sun Tzu and Wuzi by Wu Qi, Huo Qubing claimed that he naturally understood war strategies and had no need to study. When his subordinate Li Gan (李敢, son of Li Guang) assaulted Wei Qing, the latter forgave the incident. Huo Qubing, on the other hand, refused to tolerate such disrespect towards his uncle and personally shot Li Gan during a hunting trip. Emperor Wu covered for Qubing, stating that Li Gan was \"killed by a deer\".\n\nWhen it came to military glory, Huo Qubing was said to be more generous.  One story about him told of when Emperor Wu awarded Huo a jar of precious wine for his achievement, he poured it into a creek so all his men drinking the water could share a taste of it, giving the name to the city of Jiuquan (酒泉, literally \"wine spring\").\n\nHuo Qubing died in 117 BC at the early age of 23. After Huo Qubing's death, the aggrieved Emperor Wu ordered the elite troops from the five border commanderies to line up all the way from Chang'an to Maoling, where Huo Qubing's tomb was constructed in the shape of the Qilian Mountains to commemorate his military achievements. Huo Qubing was then posthumously appointed the title Marquess of Jinghuan (), and a large \"Horse Stomping Xiongnu\" () stone statue was built in front of his tomb, near Emperor Wu's tomb of Maoling.\n\nHuo Qubing was among the most decorated military commanders in Chinese history.  The Eastern Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu, summarized in his Book of Han Huo Qubing's achievements with a poem:\nThe Champion of Piaoji, fast and brave.Six long-distance assaults, like lightning and thunder.Watering horse at Lake Baikal, conducting rituals at Khentii Mountains.Conquering the area west of great river, establishing commanderies along Qilian Mountains.\n票騎冠軍，猋勇紛紜，長驅六擧，電擊雷震，飲馬翰海，封狼居山，西規大河，列郡祁連。\n\nHuo Qubing's half-brother, Huo Guang, whom he took custody away from his father, was later a great statesman who was the chief counsel for Emperor Zhao, and was instrumental in the succession of Emperor Xuan to the throne after Emperor Zhao's death.\n\nHuo Qubing's son, Huo Shàn (), succeeded him as the Marquess of Jinghuan but died young in 110 BC.  So Huo Qubing's title became extinct.  His grandson Huo Shān (霍山, later Marquess of Leping) and Huo Yun (霍云, later Marquess of Guanyang) were involved in a failed plot to overthrow Emperor Xuan of Han in 66 BC, resulting in both of them committing suicide and the Huo clan being executed. It was presumably that no male descendant of Huo Qubing nor Huo Guang survived, as during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, it was Huo Yang, a great-grandson of Huo Qubing's paternal cousin, who was chosen as the descendant of Huo Guang to be the Marquess of Bolu.\n\nPopular culture \nHuo Qubing is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Li Junfeng () in the popular 2005 historical epics TV series The Emperor in Han Dynasty ().\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Eddie Peng () under the name of Wei Wuji  () in the popular romance Chinese drama Sound of the Desert () derived from the book Da Mo Yao/Ballad of the Desert () by famous novel writer Tong Hua.\n\nHuo Qubing is also mentioned in the blockbuster film Dragon Blade, where the main character, played by Jackie Chan, is said to have been raised up by him. Actor Feng Shaofeng portrays the general in brief flashbacks.\n\nSee also \n Emperor Wu of Han\n Han–Xiongnu War\n Jin Midi\n Ban Chao\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Joseph P Yap Wars with the Xiongnu – A translation From Zizhi tongjian AuthorHouse (2009) \n\n140 BC births\n117 BC deaths\nHan dynasty generals from Shaanxi\nHan dynasty politicians from Shaanxi\nPoliticians from Xi'an", "machine_text": " Huo Qubing (140 BC – 117 BC) was a Chinese general during the Han Dynasty of China, hailed save the country and was ranked as one of the best generals in ancient Chinese history. He was the nephew of the Han Dynasty's founding emperor, and is known for leading a successful campaign against the Xiongnu and becoming one of the most successful generals in Chinese history. Huo Qubing was born the second son of Huo Guang, and was the nephew of the Han Dynasty's first emperor, Liu Bang. He served as a cavalry commander in the Han army and distinguished himself at an early age for his bravery and battle prowess. He often served as a strategist for the young Emperor Han Wu Di, who inherited the throne from his father, Liu Bang. In the sixth year of Emperor Wu's reign, Huo Qubing led 6000 cavalry in a surprise attack on the Xiongnu people in the Gobi Desert. He fought valiantly and defeated the Xiongnu in several battles, winning many victories. This campaign was by far the most successful campaign against the Xiongnu in Chinese history, and demonstrated the superior tactics employed by the Han Dynasty forces. The battle became known as the Battle of Teguk Fire, and earned Huo Qubing a reputation as one of the greatest military minds of the time. Huo Qubing died of illness in 117 BC at the age of 23, four years after leading the successful campaign against the Xiongnu. In his 23 years of life, Qubing had acquired immense prestige and had achieved many accomplishments.

The United States defeated Finland 2–1 in a shootout, to win its fifth consecutive and ninth overall title.\n\nBackground \n\nSince the first IIHF Women's World Championship in 1990 and the first women's tournament at the Winter Olympics in 1998, the American and Canadian national teams have played in the finals on all occasions except for the 2006 Winter Olympics, where Sweden played Canada after eliminating the United States in the semi-final.\n\nFinland stunned Canada in the semi-finals, beating them by a score of 4–2, their first-ever semifinal victory and advanced to the gold medal game for the first time in IIHF Women's World Championship history.\n\nDisallowed goal controversy\nDuring the final between the United States and Finland, it appeared Finland had won 2–1 after Petra Nieminen scored what appeared to be the game-winning goal in overtime. It would've been Finland first World Championship. However, since Finnish defender Jenni Hiirikoski  was pushed towards American goaltender Alex Rigsby just outside of the crease, the Video Goal Judge initiated a video review while the Finnish players were celebrating on the ice. The goal was reviewed for over ten minutes and eventually overturned. The IIHF released a press statement the next day citing rules 186 and 183ii as the reasons for overturning the goal. The two rules read:-According to IIHF Playing Rule 186 v. Goaltender and Goal/Goal Crease Disallowed: An attacking skater who makes contact other than incidental with a goaltender who is out of his goal crease during game action will be assessed a minor penalty for interference. If a goal is scored at this time, it will not count.\n \n-According to IIHF Playing Rule 183 ii. Protection of a Goaltender: Incidental contact is allowed when the goaltender is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease, provided the attacking skater makes a reasonable effort to minimize or avoid such contact. \n\nDespite the goal being disallowed, Rigsby was issued a two-minute penalty for tripping and Hiirikoski was not issued any penalties. Neither team was able to score in the remaining minutes of overtime, with the Americans successfully killing off two power-plays. The United States went on to defeat Finland 2–1 in the shootout.\n\nFinnish goaltender Noora Räty finished with 51 saves on 52 shots and Rigbsy with 26 saves on 27 shots.\n\nReactions  \nFollowing an initial period of uncertainty as the goal was being reviewed, the final decision to overturn the goal sparked a number of strong reactions from players, staff, and fans. Finnish NHLer Kasperi Kapanen spoke out against the decision, stating that \"I think they kind of messed it up,\" with retired Canadian Olympian Hayley Wickenheiser agreeing, stating \"That. Was. A. Goal.\"\n\nRigsby defended the decision, stating that she had immediately known the goal was illegal, and that \"I was the one who got body-slammed. But the ref thinks I tried tripping the player when I was on the ground, and somehow I end up with the penalty. Funny how that went.\" She, however, still praised Finland, stating that \"This is the best Finnish team we’ve ever seen.\"\n\nAftermath   \nAfter the game, the Finnish ice hockey association announced that it would be giving the players the €7000 bonus for winning gold instead of the €5000 bonus for winning silver. Unlike the men's World Championships, however, there was no IIHF bonus for the players for winning either medal.\n\nFinnish broadcaster Yle released viewership numbers of over 2,3 million people watching the finals on TV in Finland - more than half the country's population. The 2019 Finnish parliamentary election was held on the same day as the finals\n\nAfter the finals, Finnish legend Riikka Sallinen, considered among the greatest hockey players of all-time, announced her permanent retirement from the game.

In 1940, Harawitz left Germany and emigrated to the United States. He settled in New York City and began working at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, where he worked to automate calculations related to the development of radar. During his time at the lab, Harawitz developed what is considered to be the first completely portable computer system, the Harawitz Computer. This machine was capable of performing a wide variety of mathematical calculations. In the late 1940s, Harawitz left the Radiation Laboratory and went to work for the UNIVAC division of the Remington-Rand Corporation. Here he worked on the development of the UNIVAC Mark I computer, which was the first commercially available general-purpose computer. In the 1950s and 1960s, Harawitz continued to contribute to the development of computing systems. He developed software to control the installation of satellite stations as part of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and wrote software for astronomical research. Harawitz was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a recipient of the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, and a semi-finalist for the A.M. Turing Award. He retired in 1976 and died in 1994.

She was the second ship to bear the name Margaret Brooke, the first being the Abercrombie-class frigate that served during the Second World War. The frigate was named for Rear-Admiral Margaret Brooke, the first woman to rise to a flag rank in the Canadian navy. The frigate first entered service in 1988 and underwent major upgrades from 1998-2002. During this time she was taken out of service and placed in \"Extended Ready Reserve\" (ERR). She went back in service in 2002 following her major refit and modernization, and served until 2009 when she was retired and transferred to Pakistan. The Halifax-class frigates are multi-role warships, designed to perform anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and anti-air warfare (AAW). They are outfitted with Sea Sparrow missiles, Surface-to-Air Harpoon launchers, an identification friend or foe system, and many other defence systems. Additionally, the frigates can accommodate one CH-124 Sea King helicopter. Margaret Brooke performed many duties during her service career, including coastal surveillance and convoy escort. In 2002 the frigate operated as part of Operation Apollo, the Canadian mission in the War in Afghanistan. The frigate also participated in several multi-national deployments, including a deployment to South America in 2006. In 2009 HMCS Margaret Brooke completed her final deployment as part of Operation Sentry in the Mediterranean Sea. She was then taken to Halifax Naval Dockyard, where she was prepared for her transfer to the Pakistani Navy in August 2009. In 2014, a decommissioned HMCS Margaret Brooke was presented to the citizens of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, where it was put on display in Somba K’e Civic Plaza. In 2017, the frigate's remains were gathered and sold to a Pakistani firm in order to be salvaged and reused. HMCS Margaret Brooke will be remembered as a multi-mission frigate and a symbol of service and honour in the Royal Canadian Navy. Her legacy lives on as a reminder of the dedication, bravery and hard work of the thousands of sailors who served aboard her.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62339083}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Super Mario Bros. 35\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Super Mario Bros. 35 was a 2020 short-term online multiplayer platform game with battle royale elements. Developed by Arika and published by Nintendo, the game was part of the celebration of the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. in 2020. It was released on the Nintendo Switch as a free downloadable game for members of the Nintendo Switch Online service on October 1, 2020. Its servers were shut down on April 1, 2021, following the end of the Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary celebrations. The game was similar in concept to Tetris 99.\n\nThe game featured the classic platforming of Super Mario Bros., with the addition of 35 players competing in real-time in a battle royale format. Enemies that the player defeated were sent to other opponents using one of four targeting options. The game featured power-ups that could be obtained by spending collected coins on an \"item roulette\" and a timer that was extended by defeating enemies and completing levels. Super Mario Bros. 35 received generally positive reviews from critics, praising the game's unique concept of combining Super Mario Bros. with battle royale gameplay and innovation, while criticizing the game's repetition and simplicity.\n\nGameplay\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 35 combined run-and-jump platforming with battle royale elements. Thirty-five players each controlled the protagonist Mario, with Luigi being unlockable as a playable character through an easter egg, and simultaneously traversed a set of thirty-two two-dimensional levels. These courses contained items, such as coins and power-ups, and enemies that were to be defeated. A player won once all other players were defeated.\n\nDifferent enemies appeared in certain levels, with different ways of defeating them. Goombas were the most common enemies. Most enemies could be defeated by jumping onto them. Other enemies would drop a projectile when stomped on, such as the Koopa Troopa, which dropped a shell that could be kicked left or right and would ricochet when it comes in contact with an object. Bowser appeared as a boss in the fourth stage of each world. Enemies defeated by the player were sent to other opponents in real-time, appearing in their levels as an additional hindrance. Players could either manually target their opponents or choose from four types of opponents to attack: players who collected the most coins, players who had the least amount of time remaining, players who attacked the player themselves, or random players. Each player would be assigned a timer that started at 35 seconds. They were awarded additional seconds by eliminating enemies, and doing so in rapid succession yielded higher rewards. Letting the timer run out caused the player to lose. \n\nPlayers could earn a bounty of coins if they knocked out any opponents during a match. If a player collected 20 coins, they would have the option to spend them to spin the \"item roulette\". This provided the player with one of four items: Super Mushrooms, a mushroom that made Mario larger, gave him the ability to destroy bricks, and gave him an additional hitpoint; Fire Flowers, which gave Mario the ability to shoot bouncing fireballs at enemies; Super Stars, which made Mario invincible to enemies for a brief period of time; and POW Blocks, which cleared all enemies on the screen. \n\nAt the start of each game, each player could vote for which level to start on. All of the selected levels would be placed in a queue, along with some randomly-chosen levels. Beyond the first level, each player could only vote for levels they had completed. In this pre-game screen, players could also choose to spend 50 coins to start with a power-up of their choice. In limited-time \"Special Battle\" events, players could compete in a fixed list of courses and conditions that had a different theme every week. These conditions included starting with coins, a power-up, or more time on the in-game timer. \n\nThe game also featured a variety of player icons that could be unlocked by meeting various requirements, as well as daily challenges such as placing fifth or better three games in a row.\n\nDevelopment and release\nSuper Mario Bros. 35 was developed by Arika, starting before the release of the company's previous game, Tetris 99, in February 2019. Super Mario Bros. 35 was announced on September 3, 2020, as part of the Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary. Following the game's announcement, comparisons were drawn between Super Mario Bros. 35 and Mario Royale, a fan project by InfernoPlus that Nintendo had ordered to be removed one year prior due to copyright infringement. Arika denied cloning the project, stating that the game had been in development before Mario Royale was released. Super Mario Bros. 35 was released on October 1 for free for Nintendo Switch Online members; One week after the release, the game received an update fixing minor bugs and connection stability. To celebrate Halloween, the Special Battle mode only had courses that were underground and night themed from October 20 to November 2, 2020. For the final Special Battle, which ran from March 30 to April 1, all courses were in circulation in order. Some players were accused of hacking to obtain 99,999 coins in a single round to gain an easy supply of power-ups, allowing them to top the leaderboards. Nintendo took action by removing videos published online showing gameplay that was suspected of demonstrating hacking.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 35 was discontinued on April 1, 2021. According to the president of Nintendo of America, Doug Bowser, the 35th-anniversary products were discontinued due to the 35th anniversary being a celebration that was intended to be unique. He considered the concept successful, mentioning how Super Mario 3D All-Stars sold over 2 million copies in the time frame. He stated how limited-time events were not planned to be used as a marketing strategy for future anniversaries. In June 2021, Hackaday reported that a reverse engineered game server has been implemented.\n\nReception \n\nSuper Mario Bros. 35 received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. The website calculated a normalized rating of 75/100 based on 28 reviews. The game remained playable until April 1, and was removed from the Nintendo eShop the day before.\n\nCritics praised the game for its innovation and gameplay, while criticizing its repetition and simplicity. Chris Button from GameSpot noted how the game introduced a new competitive twist to the classic version. Chris Scullion from Nintendo Life stated that it took the classic game and \"dials it to 11\". Kirstin Swalley from Hardcore Gamer believed the concept was creative and \"silly in the best kind of way\". Kotakus Ethan Gach appreciated the concept, calling the late-game a \"true gauntlet of death\", but felt that the \"novelty doesn't last long\". Seth Macy of IGN reiterated the latter sentiment, noting that \"the repetition of the early levels in Super Mario Bros. 35 definitely makes it feel less super\".\n\nMajor complaints from critics focused on the repetition of early levels. Players start with only one level available to play and unlock more throughout gameplay, causing many players to be forced to play through the beginning levels because beginners have yet to have more levels unlocked. Zachary Cuevas from iMore stated that the method to unlock new levels was unclear, and Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote that not enough players were choosing different levels before a match, which he believes is due to the lack of an in-game tutorial. Button observed that the repetition creates a lack of pacing and little intensity, but that Special Battle was a good competitive alternative.\n\nOther minor complaints come from the final moments of rounds, where gameplay regularly results in two players going through levels under a test of endurance of the standard platforming. Shacknewss Ozzie Mejia stated that the final two players would \"find themselves in a deadlock after playing the same levels over and over\", but appreciated how the in-game timer would speed up to fit the moment. Gach thought the ending competition revolved only around the standard platforming but could be challenging for skilled players. Scullion stated the game went back and forth with the final players until someone won. Aubin Gregoire from Jeuxvideo.com commented that the face-to-face battles could last up to five minutes, and the gameplay started to loop.\n\nWhile critics believed the game had a complex strategy, reviewers found cases where the overwhelming difficulty could be cleared by simply using a fire flower or an invincibility star. Nadia Oxford from USgamer called the game unpredictable, and liked how randomly occurring enemies gave her a new experience from her original experience with the game. Ars Technicas Kyle Orland believed the fire flower was overpowered, and made getting through large groups of enemies too easy. He claimed that certain enemies, such as Bloopers and Buzzy Beetles, would be more of a nuisance, but were uncommon sights.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nSuper Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary\n2020 video games\nArika games\nBattle royale games\nCompetitive games\nFree-to-play video games\nMultiplayer online games\nNintendo Switch games\nNintendo Switch-only games\nPlatform games\nProducts and services discontinued in 2021\nSuper Mario\nVideo games developed in Japan\nDelisted digital-only games\nInactive multiplayer online games", "machine_text": " Super Mario Bros. 35 is a battle royale game developed by Nintendo and released as part of the 35th anniversary celebration of the original Super Mario Bros. game.

As a result of injuries sustained at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, he was paralysed. As of 2007 he could only move his head, torso, and an arm.\n\nCareer \nBrito played as a winger, and spent his career playing for Biscarrosse Olympique in the Fédérale 3 division of French rugby. An electrician by trade, he was noticeable on the field for his long dreadlocks as well as his brave play. Brito was called into the Ivorian national team squad for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Brito came on as a substitute in the opening game against Scotland which the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of \"minor\" teams in the tournament. He played again in the second game for Les Elephants, who put in a vastly improved performance against France, despite losing 54–18.\n\nInjury \nBrito started Ivory Coast's third match against Tonga on 3 June. He caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae.  Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralysed below the neck.\t\n\nAfter the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Nevertheless, in 2007, it was reported that Brito was still largely unable to move, being bedridden most of the time, with only some limited movement in his chest and arms. He and his wife have separated, whilst he has little contact with his sons, and he now lives with his parents in Bordeaux. There has been some criticism of how his case was handled, after the initial support: Damian Hopley, Head of the Professional Rugby Players' Association, said in 2003, \"We became involved in money-raising events for Max ... but there was very little support for him from Rugby World Cup.\"  \n\nIn his 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying: \"It is now 12 years since I have been in this state. I have come to the end of my tether... If one day I fall seriously ill, and if I have the strength and courage to take my own life, then I will do it...This bloody handicap - it's my curse. It kills me and I will never accept it. I can't live with it and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBut in 2020, in an interview with i, he revealed he had undergone a spiritual transformation that had helped him cope with his disability.\n\n\"I would say there were 13 or 14 years of fog where I didn't know where I was. The accident was very violent. But after that I had a spiritual enlightenment and I understood that it was necessary to accept my handicap. And from that moment on, all the doors were open.\"\n\nReferences \n\n1971 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Abidjan\nPeople with tetraplegia\nIvorian rugby union players\nRugby union wings\nIvorian expatriate rugby union players\nExpatriate rugby union players in France\nIvorian expatriate sportspeople in France", "machine_text": " Max Brito (born April 12, 1959) is an Angolan retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

Coyle.\n\nPlot\nA television mini-series told the life of Christ in a version of the typical Hollywood serial film. Each episode was thirty minutes long, bringing the total running time of the series to what might have been considered an epic six hours long if the films had been shown consecutively. Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen. Foreign film makers, however, had no such doubts, and Christ was actually shown in such films as the French Golgotha (1935), the Mexican El Martir del Calvario (1952), and the 1953 British serial Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nHowever, The Living Christ Series was not meant to be shown in movie theatres, but more as an instructional, inspirational film in churches or on Sunday-morning television. Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films. A notable exception was Lowell Gilmore, who played Pontius Pilate, and whose most famous previous role was as Basil Hallward in MGM's classic 1945 film The Picture of Dorian Gray. Character actor Lawrence Dobkin also appeared in the series, and Will Wright, perhaps most famous for appearing as Ben Weaver on several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, was cast as Herod. Martin Balsam also plays a small role. Screen unknown Robert Wilson, who would go on to practically make a career out of playing the role, portrayed Christ. Noted movie trailer announcer Art Gilmore served as narrator.\n\nThe Living Christ Series, like other similar religiously-themed films, was released by Cathedral Films.

Created by American artist Joseph Lorusso, the series is a representation of Jesus Christ within the history of Christian culture and celebration. The concept of the Living Christ Series was first developed by Christian businessman, Dr. Ward Blatch, who desired to bring a positive visual representation of Jesus Christ to the general public. The idea was to create a series of twelve paintings that depict the life of Jesus Christ in a contemporary and classical manner. The twelve paintings depict Jesus Christ, beginning with His birth, through His ministry, culminating in His resurrection and ascension. The twelve paintings are as follows: 1. The Nativity: An image depicting the birth of Jesus, with the Star of Bethlehem shining down from the heavens, amongst three Wise Men and animals, gathered next to the manger. 2. Baptism in the Jordan: Jesus standing in the Jordan River being baptized by John the Baptist. 3. Sermon on the Mount: Jesus delivering the famous Sermon on the Mount to a crowd of people near the Sea of Galilee. 4. Temptation in the Wilderness: Shows Jesus being tempted by Satan in the dessert. 5. Miracles of Jesus: A compilation of several of Jesus’ miracles, including the healing of a centurion’s son, feeding the five thousand, raising of Lazarus, calming the storm, and walking on water. 6. Transfiguration: Jesus transfigured in a beautiful ray of light with Elijah and Moses on either side of him. 7. Entry into Jerusalem: Jesus in the center of a procession, riding a donkey into Jerusalem, surrounded by people praising him. 8. Last Supper: Jesus and his moost Apostles gathering around the table for the last supper. 9. Crucifixion: Jesus on the cross surrounded by Roman soldiers. 10. Resurrection: Jesus emerging from his tomb, shown as a bright beam of light with the stone rolled away. 11. Ascension: Jesus ascending into Heaven with his eyes looking upward and surrounded by a group of angels and disciples. 12. Parousia: A representation of the Second Coming of Christ, walking on clouds with a group of people looking on in amazement. The paintings of the Living Christ Series depict its subject in realistic detail, with beautifully painted faces and drapery. Every element was carefully considered and crafted for maximum artistic impact. The Living Christ Series was officially debuted in 2011 and has since been exhibited in galleries, museums, and churches across the United States. It has also been featured in numerous publications, including Smithsonian Magazine and Time Magazine. In 2014, The Living Christ Series was also awarded the \"Outstanding Contribution to Christian Art Award\" by the Association of Religion and Art. Recently, a documentary was released, chronicling the creative process behind the making of the series. The documentary features an in-depth look at the artist’s process and the inspiration behind the work. The Living Christ Series seeks to provide a new perspective on Jesus’ life and ministry, inspiring viewers to a closer relationship with him and to a greater understanding of Christian history and faith.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31094908}

The song was composed and arranged by album producer Johnny Fields and was recorded at Fame Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The song is notable as the Blind Boys' first secular single, a move that was considered by many to be sacrilegious at the time. The single was a minor hit on R&B radio, as well as receiving some limited airplay on rock radio in the United States. The song has since been covered by various musical acts over the years, including Bonnie Raitt and Kim Weston. It has also been featured in the films The Apostle (1997) and We Are Marshall (2006). I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star) is a mid-tempo gospel-soul song that features lead vocals from Clarence Fountain, backed by the other members of the Blind Boys. The track also includes Bill Helm on piano, Raymond Moore on guitar, and Clarence Carter and David Hood on bass. The song uses a chorus of backing vocalists to enhance the sound. The lyrics feature a comparison between a gospel singer's recognition of Jesus and the star-studded admiration of the same figure. The singer proclaims, \"They say that He's the King of Kings / But I knew Jesus before all those things / He's still my Lord, no matter who sings\". The song is often interpreted as a statement of faith, in which the singer refuses to be swayed by the praise of the masses. The Blind Boys of Alabama have included \"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" in their live sets ever since its original release, and it has become one of their signature songs over the years. The group have also recorded several gospel sequels to the track, such as \"He's Still My Lord Again and Again\". I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\" remains a classic cut in the Blind Boys of Alabama discography, and continues to be an influence on spiritual music to this day.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19234121}

It can withstand long periods of drought and prefers sunny exposures. The plant is widely used for its medicinal uses. The leaves of Ballota pseudodictamus have been used since antiquity for their purgative and diuretic properties. The leaves and stems are brewed into a tea that is said to relieve stomachaches, respiratory issues, and improve digestion. In some traditions, it is believed to ward off the ill-effects from thunder and lightning. In folk medicine the plant is used topically to treat skin diseases, wounds, burns, and ulcers. The plant's scent is said to repel mosquitos, flies, and other insects. In Italy, the plant is used to make a digestive elixir. The leaves and stems of the plant are boiled in wine, brandy, or grappa to produce a sweet liqueurknown as elisir di gaudenzo or ues-umes. In modern times, the components of Ballota pseudodictamnus have been studied for their medicinal properties. Researchhas found that the plant contains flavonoids, terpenes, and essential oils. The essential oil contains menthol, thymol and carvacrol, which are antiseptic and antifungal. Studies have indicated that extracts of the plant have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects. Ballota pseudodictamnus is protected under the Habitats Regulations of the European Community and listed in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive.

The 2012 Tampa Bay Rays season was the 15th season of the Tampa Bay Rays franchise, and the 12th as the \"Rays,\" since the franchise was renamed prior to the 2008 season. The Rays finished 90–72 and made the playoffs for the fourth time in the previous six seasons, winning the Wild Card en route to the American League Division Series. The season saw a number of first for the franchise in its new name, led by the first postseason series victory in franchise history. The city of St. Petersburg, Florida, also played host to its first ever playoff games, as the Rays held homefield advantage in the Wild Card game and hosted each game of the ALDS. The Rays opened the season under new Manager Joe Maddon and posted a 9–8 record during the month of April. They finished the month with a 24–20 record, third in the American League East division, just 0.5 games out of first place. They then posted a 13–15 record in May, and finished the first half of the season with a 37–35 record and remained in third place. The Rays went on to post a 25–13 record in June and July, vaulting them into first place in the division. They pulled away from the pack in August and September by posting a 33–17 record during those two months, and finished the season 90–72 and won the Wild Card over the Baltimore Orioles. With the Wild Card victory, they advanced to face the Texas Rangers in the ALDS. The Rays won their first ever playoff series, taking the first two games in Texas, but the Rangers rebounded to win the next two games in Tampa and force a decisive Game 5. The Rays went on to win the deciding game 5–2 and advance to their first American League Championship Series. The Rays, however, were unable to win their division championship, losing to the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS in five games.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"James Lockhart (historian)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "James Lockhart (born April 8, 1933 - January 17, 2014) was a U.S. historian of colonial Spanish America, especially the Nahua people and Nahuatl language.\n\nBorn in Huntington, West Virginia, Lockhart attended West Virginia University (BA, 1956) and the University of Wisconsin–Madison (MA, 1962; PhD, 1967). Late in life, Lockhart wrote a short, candid memoir. He joined the US Army and was posted to Germany, working in \"a low-level intelligence agency,\" translating letters from East Germany. Returning to the US, he entered the graduate program at University of Wisconsin, where he pursued his doctorate in the social history of conquest-era Peru.\n\nHis dissertation, published in 1968 as Spanish Peru, 1531-1560 was a path breaking approach to this early period. Less interested in the complicated political events of the era, he focused on the formation of Spanish colonial society in the midst of Spanish war with the indigenous and internecine struggles between factions of conquerors.  With separate chapters on different social groups, including Africans and indigenous brought into the Spanish sphere, and an important chapter on women of the conquest era, his work shifted the understanding of that era.  His main source for the people and processes of this early period were notarial documents, often property transfers and other types of legal agreements, which gave insight into the formation and function of Spanish colonial society.  The work is now a classic and was published in a second, revised edition in 1994.\n\nWhile researching Spanish Peru, he compiled information on the Spaniards who received a share of the ransom of the Inca Atahualpa, extracted at Cajamarca. The Men of Cajamarca has both individual biographies of those who shared in the treasure, as well as a thorough analysis of the general social patterns of those conquerors.  Both Spanish Peru and The Men of Cajamarca have been published in Spanish translation.\n\nHe began to do research on colonial Mexico while at University of Texas, looking both at the socioeconomic patterns there and began learning Nahuatl.  Fruits of these new interests were the publication of the anthology Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution (edited with Ida Altman) and Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period (with linguist Frances Karttunen).\n\nHe moved to University of California, Los Angeles, where he spent the bulk of his teaching career 1972–1994, retiring early and continuing to collaborate with colleagues on research projects and mentor graduate students working on historical sources in the Nahuatl language and the colonial-era Nahua people.\n\nAmong his many graduate students in colonial Spanish American social history and the philology of Mesoamerican indigenous languages, who earned doctorates under his mentorship are S.L.(Sarah) Cline, Kimberly Gauderman,  Robert Haskett, Rebecca Horn, John E. Kicza, Leslie K. Lewis, Doris Namala, Leslie Offutt, Matthew Restall, Susan Schroeder, Lisa Sousa, Kevin Terraciano, John Tutino, John Super, and Stephanie Wood.\n\nHe was a major contributor to a field of ethnohistory built on the study of indigenous-language sources from colonial Mexico, which he called New Philology. He collaborated with colonial Brazilianist Stuart B. Schwartz in writing Early Spanish America (1983), which is a foundational text for graduate students studying colonial Latin America.  He was the series editor for the Nahuatl Studies Series, initially based at the UCLA Latin American Center and then jointly with Stanford University Press. Lockhart was honored by the Conference on Latin American History Distinguished Service Award in 2004.\n\nHe died on 17 January 2014 at the age of 80.\n\nWorks\n\nSpanish Peru, 1532-1560 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968; second edition 1994).\nThe Men of Cajamarca: A Social and Biographical Study of the First Conquerors of Peru (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1972).\nThe Social History of Colonial Spanish America: evolution and potential Austin, Texas: University of Texas Institute of Latin American Studies, 1972).\nNahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period (with Frances Karttunen, Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1976).\nBeyond the Codices: The Nahua View of Colonial Mexico (with Arthur J.

Preceded by a proposal, courtship traditionally begins after a betrothal and concludes with the celebration of marriage (though in the present-day, courtship may precede the betrothal, which is then followed by the wedding). Christian theologian John Piper distinguished courtship from dating, teaching that:\n\nAndre Marie, a brother of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, discusses that courtship allows a couple to become acquainted with one another, and that physical intimacy is saved only for those in wedlock. Christian minister Patricia Bootsma further delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in \"courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors\". She further states that with courtship, \"commitment happens before intimacy\". \n\nChristian courtship remains normative in certain Christian countries such as Guatemala, in which much of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. In the United States, courtship is seen as a response to secular dating culture in which various Christian communities might find themselves, c. 1985 to present. Motivated by concern for the need of Christian values in contrast to secular dating practices, conservative Christians identified what they saw as key Biblical principles for courtship and romance, and began to disseminate them in the 1980s.\n\nThe practice of traditional Christian courtship among church members belonging to various Christian denominations experienced a revival in the 1980s. Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s.

This process includes several stages, such as getting to know each other, developing a friendship, honoring purity, and preparing for a long-term commitment through accountability, prayer and accountability. Traditionally, couples seeking to marry held each other in high esteem, made the decision to marry only after serious consideration, prayed for direction from God and valued their parents’ counsel. Other characteristics of Christian courtship may include no physical contact until marriage (excluding holding hands), modest dress, saving physical expressions of affection for marriage, and commitment to the Church community as well as the couple’s families. Christian courtship is not about recreational dating or casual relationships; rather, it is about choosing someone to pursue a meaningful and long-term relationship with. The period of courtship should be an intentional yet enjoyable time of getting to know someone, discerning if they are the rightful partner and opening oneself to the possibility of marriage. There are three main components integral to the Christian courtship process: prayer, communication and accountability. Couples should regularly pray together, talk about their intentions and future, and form relationships with other couples who are supportive of the process. Today, Christian organization have created a variety of support systems to help couples who are going through the courtship process. In the dating world of today, there is a need for more balanced and intentional approaches to relationships. Christian courtship offers a theology and practice that stands in contrast to many of the more casual, often noncommittal approaches to relationships found in contemporary society. People who practice Christian courtship believe that, when done correctly, it can deepen their walk with God and help them to find a spouse who is similar in belief. Ultimately, Christian courtship is a journey to appreciate and respect the other’s worth, the journey towards a perfect union, the journey towards a blessed and eternal marriage.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"55 Cancri\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "55 Cancri is a binary star system located 41 light-years away from the Sun in the zodiac constellation of Cancer. It has the Bayer designation Rho1 Cancri (ρ1 Cancri); 55 Cancri is the Flamsteed designation (abbreviated 55 Cnc). The system consists of a K-type star (designated 55 Cancri A, also named Copernicus ) and a smaller red dwarf (55 Cancri B).\n\n, five extrasolar planets (designated 55 Cancri b, c, d, e and f; named Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot, respectively) are believed to orbit 55 Cancri A.\n\nNomenclature\n55 Cancri is the system's Flamsteed designation. It also bears the Bayer designation ρ1 Cancri (Latinised to Rho1 Cancri) and the Bright Star Catalogue designation HR 3522. The two components are designated A and B, though A is itself sometimes referred to as 55 Cancri. The first planet discovered orbiting 55 Cancri A was designated HR 3522b by its discoverers, though it is more commonly referred to as 55 Cancri b. Under the rules for naming objects in binary star systems it should be named 55 Cancri Ab and this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with the secondary star 55 Cancri B. The other planets discovered were designated 55 Cancri c, d, e and f, in order of their discovery.\n\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Copernicus for 55 Cancri A and Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot for its planets (b, c, d, e and f, respectively).\n\nThe winning names were those submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. They honor the astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe and Thomas Harriot and the spectacle makers and telescope pioneers Hans Lipperhey and Jacharias Janssen. (The IAU originally announced the winning name was Lippershey for 55 Cancri d. In January 2016, in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey (with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century), the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information).\n\nIn 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nStellar system\nThe 55 Cancri system is located fairly close to the Solar System: the Gaia astrometry satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 79.45 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of . 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just visible to the naked eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of  (6.15 light-days). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.\n\nThe primary star, 55 Cancri A, has a spectral type of K0IV-V, indicating a main-sequence or subgiant star. It is smaller in radius and slightly less massive than the Sun, and so is cooler and less luminous. The star has only low emission from its chromosphere, and is not variable in the visible spectrum; but it is variable in X-rays. It is more enriched than the Sun in elements heavier than helium, with 186% the solar abundance of iron; it is therefore classified as a rare \"super metal-rich\" (SMR) star. 55 Cancri A also has more carbon than the Sun, with a C/O ratio of 0.78, compared to solar value of 0.55. This abundance of metal makes estimating the star's age and mass difficult, as evolutionary models are less well defined for such stars. 55 Cancri A is much older than the solar system, and its age has been estimated to values of 7.4–8.7 billion years or 10.2 ± 2.5 billion years.\n\nA hypothesis for the high metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone would mean that the outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.\n\nObservations of 55 Cancri A in the submillimeter region of the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within  of this star is about 850 mJy, at a wavelength of 850 μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not exclude the presence of an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.\n\nThe secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than the Sun. There are indications that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.\n\nPlanetary system\n\nThe 55 Cancri system was the first known to have four, and later five, planets, and may possibly have more. The innermost planet, e, transits 55 Cancri A as viewed from Earth. The next planet, b, is non-transiting but there is tentative evidence that it is surrounded by an extended atmosphere that does transit the star.\n\nIn 1997, the discovery of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted for by this planet, which could be explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.\n\nIn 1998 the discovery of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40 AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the plane of the sky. However, the discovery could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.\n\nAfter making further radial velocity measurements, a planet orbiting at a distance of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.\n\n55 Cancri e was announced in 2004. With 8.3 Earth masses, it is a large super-Earth which was originally thought to have an orbital period of 2.8 days, though it was later found that this was an alias of its true period of 0.74 of a day by observations of e transiting in 2011. This planet was the first known instance of a fourth extrasolar planet in one system, and was the shortest-period planet until the discovery of PSR J1719−1438 b. The measurements that led to the discovery of this planet also confirmed the existence of 55 Cancri c.\n\nIn 2005, Jack Wisdom combined three data sets and drew two distinct conclusions: that the 2.8-day planet was an alias and that there was a Neptune-scale planet with a period near 261 days. Fischer et al. (2008) reported new observations that they said confirmed the existence of the 2.8-day planet, as first reported by McArthur et al. (2004), and a 260-day Neptune-sized planet, as first reported by Wisdom (2005). However, Dawson and Fabrycky (2010) concluded that the 2.8-day planet was indeed an alias, as suggested by Wisdom (2005), and that the correct period was 0.7365 of a day.\n\nIn 2007, Fisher et al. confirmed the existence of the 260-day planet proposed in 2005 by Wisdom. This planet, 55 Cancri f, was the first occurrence of a fifth extrasolar planet in one system. With a similar mass to c, it has a 260-day orbit, towards the inner edge of 55 Cancri A's habitable zone. The planet itself is not thought to be conducive to life, but hypothetical moons in principle could maintain at least microbial life.\n\nThe planet e's eccentricity is poorly defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking interactions between the planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.\n\nAstrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° of the outer planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-sight, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclinations have been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar in order to maintain stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.\n\nThe approximate ratios of periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance, rather than a genuine mean motion resonance.\n\nBetween planets f and d, there appears to be a huge gap of distance where no planets are known to orbit. A 2008 paper found that as many as 3 additional planets of up to 50 times the mass of Earth could orbit at a distance of 0.9 to 3.8 AU from the star, and stable resonances of an hypothetical planet g with the known planets were found to be 3f:2g, 2g:1d, and 3g:2d. A study released in 2019 showed that undiscovered terrestrial planets may be able to orbit safely in this region at 1 to 2 AU; this space includes the outer limits of 55 Cancri's habitable Zone.\nAs for the space outside d's orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, though there is a stability zone between 8.6 and 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.\n\nCommunication\nA METI message was sent to 55 Cancri. It was transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar—the  Evpatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 2; it was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 55 Cancri in May 2044.\n\nSee also\n Sudarsky's gas giant classification\n Cancer in Chinese astronomy\n Kepler-186\n Lists of exoplanets\n Gliese 1132 b – rocky exoplanet with a confirmed atmosphere\n Mu Arae c – At constellation Ara\n Planetary system\n PSR B1257+12\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n \n When the Gods Fall 55 Cancri in fiction.\n Extrasolar Planet Interactions by Rory Barnes & Richard Greenberg, Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona\n The First and the second part of a computer animation of the 55 Cancri planetary system.\n Interactive visualisation of the 55 Cancri system\n\n \nCancri, Rho1\nBinary stars\nCancer (constellation)\nCircumstellar disks\nBD+28 1660\nCancri, 55\nK-type main-sequence stars\nCancri, 55\n0324\n075732\n043587\n3522\nPlanetary systems with five confirmed planets\nPlanetary transit variables\n2\nK-type subgiants", "machine_text": " 55 Cancri is a binary star system located in the constellation of Cancer, and is composed of two stellar components. The primary component is a yellow-orange G-type star around twice as massive and eight times as luminous as the Sun, while the companion is an orange K-type star of approximately 65% the Sun’s mass and around 13% of the luminosity. The two stars are separated by about 8 arc seconds, making 55 Cancri one of the biggest stellar systems in the night sky. The primary star, 55 Cancri A, is the brighter and more prominent star of the pair and has been classified as a S1.5 (subgiant or supergiant) star located 36.6 light years away from the Solar System, with an approximate magnitude of 6.0. It has been studied extensively and the analysis of its photosphere hints that the star may have twice the solar abundance of elements that are heavier than helium, like oxygen and carbon. The companion star, 55 Cancri B, is a type K1 (main sequence star), a bit cooler and dimmer than the primary. It orbits around the primary star at a distance of about 79 astronomical units (AU). Due to its distance from the primary star, the companion has only been observed at near-infrared wavelengths and its exact spectral type remains uncertain. The two stars are separated by a distance of about 142 AU. 55 Cancri is one of the first binary stars to be studied in depth and was used as a model to try to better understand the behavior of stars in binary systems. Observations of the primary indicate that it may have a planet orbiting around it, and this has been confirmed by several follow-up studies. This extrasolar planet, known as 55 Cancri b, was discovered in 2007, destabilizing the star’s orbital plane and perturbing its orbit. The star is visible to the naked eye, located in the eastern horizon near the border between Gemini and Cancer in the night sky. 55 Cancri is part of the YY Geminorum star group, which also includes Zeta Geminorum, Kappa Geminorum, Eta Geminorum, Delta Geminorum, and Gamma Geminorum. 55 Cancri is an important star for astronomers as it not only provides an opportunity for scientists to gain insight into the behavior of binary stars, but also to study the effects of extra-solar planets.

She scored 1176/1200 in the 12th standard exams in the Tamil Nadu State Board. This would have secured her a medical seat, if only the State Board marks had been considered for admission. In NEET-UG 2017, Anitha secured 12.33 percentage of marks while she scored 86 out of 720 marks. The minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentage for students in the reserved category.\n\nThe minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentage ( [107 to 130] out of 720 marks ) for students in the reserved category, while it was 50 percentage for general category ( [131 to 697] out of 720 marks ). Anitha scored 12.33 percentage while admission was 14.9 for reserved and 18.2 for general categories for 2018 admission.\n\nAdmission to medical colleges is based on NEET rank calculated by the percentage arrived at with the highest score and not on the marks obtained in NEET exam.\n\nOn 1 September 2017, she committed suicide by hanging. Her death created a major controversy in Tamil Nadu where the National Eligibility and Entrance Test for medical admissions was strongly opposed. She has become a cause celebre as a victim of the system.\n\nBackground\nAnitha  belonged  to a poor Dalit family in Kuzhumur village, Ariyalur district in rural Tamil Nadu. Anitha was the daughter of a daily wage labourer and her mother had died when she was young. She was brought up by her grandmother and lived in a house without even a toilet. She studied in a Tamil Medium school and was amongst the toppers in her district and she was the only student in Ariyalur district to score 100% marks in Physics and Mathematics in the 12th standard examination. Anitha always wanted to become a doctor. She saw that it was not possible for poor rural students to afford expensive coaching needed to prepare for NEET exams and only if medical admission selections were done based on the 12th standard marks alone would rural students be able to get seats. Anitha was unable to meet the cutoff and secure a seat through NEET.   Anitha was offered an aeronautical engineering course seat  at the Madras Institute of Technology  but as she only wanted to be a doctor she did not take up the offer. She would have been the first from her community in her village to become a doctor.\n\nNEET court case\nThe Tamil Nadu government  originally considered reserving 85% of the seats to Tamil Nadu State Board students. The Madras High Court dismissed it after an appeal.  Later  Tamil Nadu government had also promised exemption from National Eligibility and Entrance Test for one year. However the Supreme Court of India dismissed Tamil Nadu government's plea after the central government refused to support  Tamil Nadu's  ordinance seeking  exemption from NEET for one year.\n\nAnitha implead herself in the petition in the Supreme Court against NEET claiming it was against the interests of rural students after a case was filed by Central Board of Secondary Education students represented by senior advocate Nalini Chidambaram, wife of P. Chidambaram, who argued that admissions should be made only on basis of NEET. After the Supreme Court of India verdict which stated that admissions should be made only based on NEET, Nalini Chidambaram stated, \"Any further appeal against NEET can only be done to God,\" and that the Tamil Nadu government could no longer do anything for State Board students after the Supreme Court verdict.\n\nAnitha committed suicide by hanging herself nine days after the verdict.\n\nProtest\n\nHer suicide led  to protests all over Tamil Nadu  against NEET after her death. Anitha's family refused Tamil Nadu government's compensation offer. The large scale protests led to the Supreme Court of India to ask the Tamil Nadu Government to control the protests.\n\nThe BJP claimed that her suicide is a political conspiracy against the BJP.

Anitha was an Indian student and civil rights activist who took her own life on 1 September 2018 at her family home in her village of Gokilapuram, Tamil Nadu. She was 17 years old at the time of her death. Anitha was born in the village of Gokilapuram and was the daughter of a daily-wage labourer. She had been a dedicated student since the age of 5, earned high scores in the 12th grade-level Tamil Nadu Board of Education public examinations, and went on to gain admission to a government medical college in India. In 2017, Anitha was one of twenty students to score above 1,100 marks, qualifying her for admission to any of the numerous state-run medical colleges. However, due to a new law that was passed in July of 2017, Anitha was unable to secure a seat in a medical college because she not scored high enough on the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET). Despite Anitha having achieved the highest score among students from Tamil Nadu, she was unable to attend the medical college due to the new law. The new law excluded Anitha and other students from Tamil Nadu from gaining admission to the medical college, sparking a heated debate about the importance of NEET and other entrance exams in the state. Many organisations, including political and non-governmental organisations, rallied in support of Anitha, while other members of the public criticised the new law. Despite the immense outcry over the injustice towards Anitha, the Supreme Court rejected her plea to exempt Tamil Nadu students from the NEET examination. This decision came as a shock to Anitha and her family, who had sacrificed all their savings in order to help her pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. On 1 September 2018, heartbroken and unable to endure the humiliation, Anitha committed suicide, making a powerful statement against the injustices faced by the students of Tamil Nadu. Anitha's death was widelyreported and caused an uproar throughout India and across the wider world. Anitha's story quickly moved from the local media of Tamil Nadu and into the national and international scene, sparking conversations about education reform in India. Her tragic death has also been used to draw attention to the problems of social and economic inequality in India that are deeply embedded within the country. Amidst the many stories of Anitha's life, death and struggle, the tale of S. Anitha continues to be a powerful example of the inequality faced by the youth of India and their marginalised backgrounds.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Subcountability\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In constructive mathematics, a collection  is subcountable if there exists a partial surjection from the natural numbers onto it. \nThis may be expressed as\n\nwhere  is the set of natural numbers ( with disregard for arithmetic) and where  denotes that  is a surjective function from  onto .\nIn other words, all elements of a subcountable collection  are functionally in the image of an indexing set of counting numbers  and thus the set  can be understood as being dominated by the countable set .\n\nDiscussion\n\nExample \nAn important case is where  denotes some subclass of a bigger class of functions as studied in computability theory. \n\nConsider the total computable functions and note that being total is not a decidable property, i.e. there cannot be a constructive bijection between the total functions and the natural numbers. However, via enumeration of the codes of all possible partial computable functions (which also allows non-terminating programs), subsets of those, such as the total functions, are seen to be subcountable sets. Note that by Rice's theorem on index sets, most domains  are not recursive. Indeed, no effective map between all counting numbers  and the infinite (non-finite) indexing set  is asserted here, merely the subset relation . Being dominated by a constructively non-countable set of numbers , the name subcountable thus conveys that the uncountable set  is no bigger than .\n\nThe demonstration that  is subcountable also implies that it is classically (non-constructively) formally countable, but this does not reflect any effective countability. In other words, the fact that an algorithm listing all total functions in sequence cannot be coded up is not captured by classical axioms regarding set and function existence. We see that, depending on the axioms of a theory, subcountability may be more likely to be provable than countability.\n\nRelation to Excluded Middle \nIn constructive logics and set theories, which tie the existence of a function between infinite (non-finite) sets to questions of effectivity and decidability, the subcountability property splits from countability and is thus not a redundant notion. \nThe indexing set  of natural numbers may be posited to exist, e.g. as a subset via set theoretical axioms like the separation axiom schema, so that \n. \nBut this set may then still fail to be detachable, in the sense that\n\ncannot be proven without assuming it as an axiom.\nOne may fail to effectively count  if one fails to map the counting numbers  into the indexing set , for this reason.\n\nIn classical mathematics \nAsserting all laws of classical logic, the disjunctive property of  discussed above indeed does hold for all sets. Then, for nonempty , the properties numerable ( injects into ), countable ( has  as its range), subcountable (a subset of  surjects into ) and also not -productive (a countability property essentially defined in terms of subsets of , formalized below) are all equivalent and express that a set is finite or countably infinite.\n\nNon-classical assertions \nNot asserting the law of excluded middle \n for all proposition , \nit can then also be consistent to assert the subcountability of sets that classically (i.e. non-constructively) exceed the cardinality of the natural numbers.\nNote that in a constructive setting, a countability claim about the function space  out of the full set , as in , may be disproven. But subcountability  of an uncountable set  by a set  that is not effectively detachable from  may be permitted.\n\nAs  is uncountable and classically in turn provably not subcountable, the classical framework with its large function space is incompatible with the constructive Church's thesis, an axiom of Russian constructivism.\n\nSet theories\n\nCantorian arguments on subsets of the naturals \nAs reference theory we look at the constructive set theory , which has Replacement, Bounded Separation, strong Infinity, is agnostic towards the existence of power sets, but includes the axiom that asserts that any function space  is set, given  are also sets. \nIn this theory, it is moreover consistent to assert that every set is subcountable. \n\nThe compatibility of various axioms is discussed in this section by means of possible surjections on an infinite set of counting numbers .\n\nThe situations discussed below—onto function spaces versus onto power classes—are different insofar as for functions , by definition there exists a unique return value for every value  in the domain, . As opposed to general predicates and their truth values (not necessarily just true and false), a function (which in programming terms is terminating) makes accessible information about data for all its subdomains (subsets of the ). Viewed as characteristic functions, they decide membership. As such, in , the (total) functions  are not automatically in bijection with all the subsets of  Constructively, subsets are a more involved concept than characteristic functions. \n\nIn fact, in the context of some non-classical axioms, even the power class of a singleton, e.g. the class  of all subsets of , is shown to be a proper class.\n\nOnto function spaces\nAsserting the permitted subcountability of all sets turns, in particular,  into a subcountable set. \n\nSo here we consider a surjective function  and the set comprehended/separated as\n\nwith the diagonalizing predicate defined as\n\nwhich we can also phrase without the negations as\n.\nThis set is classically a function in  and can classically be used to prove that the existence of the  is actually contradictory.\nHowever, constructively, unless the proposition  in its definition is decidable so that the set actually defined a functional assignment, we just cannot draw this conclusion.\n\nIn this fashion, subcountability of  is permitted. Nevertheless, also in the case of , the existence of a full surjection , with domain , is indeed contradictory, since membership of  is decidable.\n\nBeyond these observations, also note that for any non-zero number , the functions  in  involving the surjection  cannot be extended to all of  by a similar contradiction argument. In other words, there are then partial functions that cannot be extended to full functions .\nNote that when given a , one cannot necessarily decide whether , and so one cannot even decide whether the value of a potential function extension on  is even already determined for a surjection .\n\nThe subcountibility axiom, asserting all sets are subcountable, is incompatible with any new axiom making  countable, including .\n\nOnto power classes\nNext we study possible postulates of the existence of a surjection . (This, by Replacement in  would imply  is a set.) The violating subset of  is\n\nwhich, as , in this case simplifies to just\n \nwhere \n\nadapted from Cantors theorem about power sets. That subset exists via Separation. The existence of the surjection immediately implies the existence of a number  with \n, \nrendering membership necessarily undecidable and incompatible with any realization. \nPropositions of this form, , must be rejected according to the consequences of the negation introduction law. So such a surjection does not exist and  cannot be subcountable.\n\nWe conclude that the subcountability axiom, asserting all sets are subcountable, is incompatible with  being a set, as implied e.g. by the power set axiom.\n\nThe notion of size \nAs seen in the example of the function space considered in computability theory, not every infinite subset of  necessarily is in constructive bijection with , thus making room for a more refined distinction between uncountable sets in constructive contexts. \nThe function space  (and also ) in a moderately rich set theory is always found to be neither finite nor in bijection with , by Cantor's diagonal argument. This is what it means to be uncountable. But the argument that the cardinality of that set would thus in some sense exceed that of the natural numbers relies on a restriction to just the classical size conception and its induced ordering of sets by cardinality.\nMotivated by the above sections, the infinite set  may be considered \"smaller\" than the class . Subcountability as judgement of small size shall not be conflated with the standard mathematical definition of cardinality relations as defined by Cantor, with smaller cardinality being defined in terms of injections out of  and equality of cardinalities being defined in terms of bijections. \nMoreover, note that constructively, an ordering \"\" like that of cardinalities can be undecidable.\n\nModels \nThe above analysis affects formal properties of codings of . Models for this non-classical extension of  theory have been constructed. \nSuch non-constructive axioms can be seen as choice principles which, however, do not tend to increase the  proof-theoretical strengths of the theories much. \n\nMore examples:\n There are models of  in which all sets with apartness relations are subcountable.\n In the constructive set theory , as discussed, it is indeed consistent to assert the Subcountability Axiom that all sets are (internally) subcountable. The resulting theory is in contradiction to the Axiom of power set and with the law of excluded middle.\n More stronger yet, some models of Kripke–Platek set theory validate that all sets are even countable.\n\nSubcountable implies not -productive \nAny countable set is subcountable and any subcountable set is not -productive:\nA set  is said to be -productive if, whenever any of its subsets is the range of some partial function  on , there always remains at least one element that lies outside that range. This may be expressed as\n\nA set being -productive speaks for how hard it is to generate its elements: They cannot be generated using a single function. As such, -productive sets escape subcountability.\nDiagonal arguments often involve this notion, be it explicitly or implicitly.\n\nSee also\n Cantor's diagonal argument\n Computable function\n Constructive set theory\n Schröder–Bernstein theorem\n Subquotient\n Total order\n\nReferences \n\nConstructivism (mathematics)", "machine_text": " Subcountability is a term used in mathematics to describe the property of having a finite cardinality that is smaller than the cardinality of any proper subset. This concept is closely related to the notion of countability and applies to set theory and topology. In set theory, a set is subcountable if it can be mapped one-to-one onto a proper subset of itself. This means that a subcountable set can be represented by a smaller number of elements than it contains. A set that is subcountable is said to have subcountable cardinality or subcountably infinite cardinality. Subcountability has several useful applications in mathematics, particularly in topology. For example, it may be used to prove that some topological spaces are closed. A closed set is a set that contains all of its boundary points. It follows that if a set is subcountable, then any boundary point it has must also be contained in the set. Thus, proving that a topological space is subcountable is a way of showing that it is closed. An example of a subcountable set is the set of positive integers, {1, 2, 3, ...}. This set is clearly finite, and its cardinality is countably infinite. However, each proper subset of the set has a strictly lower cardinality than the overall set, making it subcountable. Subcountable sets can also be used to prove certain theorems in topology. For example, the Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Subcountability can be used to show that such a set is closed, since its boundary points will necessarily be contained in the set. In addition, subcountability allows for the defined notion of denseness, which is a property of sets in which its interior points are dense in its closure. In summary, subcountability is a useful concept in mathematics, particularly topology. It can be used to prove the closure of a set, which is a crucial part of many theorems. Additionally, subcountable sets are also useful for defining properties such as denseness.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15036487}

Dr. Darren Lund made a complaint about the letter to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission. In 2008, a human rights panel ruled that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt,\" ordering Boissoin to apologize to Lund and pay $5,000 in damages. Boissoin appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. In 2009, the Court of Queen's Bench overturned the Panel's ruling. In 2012, the Court of Appeal of Alberta upheld the Queen's Bench decision.\n\n2002 letter to the Red Deer Advocate\nIn June 2002, Reverend Stephen Boissoin, Central Alberta Chairman of the Concerned Christian Coalition, sent a letter to the Red Deer Advocate.

A one-member Alberta Human Rights Panel accepted Lund's arguments that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt.\" The Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervened in the case, condemning the views expressed in the letter but arguing they should not be subject to legal sanction.\n\nOn 30 May 2008, the Alberta Human Rights Panel ordered Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition to refrain from publishing future disparaging remarks about homosexuals and provide Lund with a written apology and in $5,000 damages.\n\nCourt of Queen’s Bench of Alberta\nBoissoin appealed the ruling to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. On 3 December 2009, the Court overturned the decision of the Alberta Human Rights Panel.

The Court also identified \"troubling aspects of the process leading to the decision of the Panel,\" including the inclusion of the Concerned Christian Coalition as a respondent.\n\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta\nIn March 2010, Lund appealed the Court of Queen's Bench ruling to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. In October 2012, the Court dismissed the appeal, ruling in favor of Boissoin. The Court agreed with the lower court that Boissoin’s letter was \"a polemic on a matter of public interest and does not qualify as reaching the extreme limits... to expose persons to hatred or contempt,\" within the meaning of the Alberta Human Rights Act. The Court also stated that \"it is not clear that Boissoin could have phrased the same purely political opinion in any more acceptable or polite way than he chose.\"\n\nOpposition from Ezra Levant\nJournalist Ezra Levant was a fierce critic of the case and the provincial human rights commission.  He republished Rev. Boissoin's letter verbatim, resulting in a complaint against Levant. When the Alberta Human Rights Commission dismissed the resulting complaint in November 2008, Levant accused the human rights commissions of religious discrimination, asserting that \"100% of the CHRC's targets have been white, Christian or conservative\" and that \"It's legal for a Jew like me to publish [Boissoin’s letter].

It was centred around a complaint filed by University of Alberta student Tracy Lund against Stephen Boissoin, a fundamentalist Christian pastor, who wrote a letter containing anti-gay views which was published in the Red Deer Advocate in 2002. The complaint alleged that Boissoin had violated Alberta’s then Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act by publishing the letter in the newspaper. The Canadian Constitution Foundation, a group representing conservative values, supported Boissoin's case. In June 2003, the Alberta Human Rights Commission upheld the complaint, finding that Boissoin’s letter was discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation and made its ruling by stating that Boissoin was to cease publishing in newspapers, acknowledge his mistake in a full-page advertisement, pay Lund C$5,000 in costs and C$5,000 as compensation for injury to her dignity, feelings and self-respect. The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta heard arguments regarding the case in March 2008 and rendered its decision two months later. The court held that portions of the Human Rights Commission’s ruling were in error and that the Commission “crossed the line and ignored some basic tenets of Charter protection of expressive activity in writing and publishing the remedy it imposed.”. In the following November, the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the Court of Queen's Bench decision. As a result of Lund v Boissoin, it had been argued by some that Alberta's human rights legislation is unconstitutional and has violated democratic values concerning the right to free speech. However, in the ruling from higher court, it was concluded that free speech shouldn't be absolute under any situation and should be subject to restrictions. The ruling was perceived by some to have supported or affirmed the right of individuals to express their religious beliefs while protecting the rights of individuals from the harm caused by such beliefs. Since the ruling, this case has become a significant example of the struggle for religious freedom and the limitations of free speech in Canada. It serves as an example of how Canadians are attempting to balance their rights with respect to free speech and with respect to public expression of their religious beliefs. The ruling in this case also touched on how the Canadian concept of fundamental freedoms is being applied to its citizens. The court suggested that governments should be careful when imposing limits on speech, arguing that citizens should be allowed to express ideas and beliefs that may be considered disagreeable or offensive, as long they do not lead to harm. This decision could have implications for Canadian law going forward regarding how Canadians are allowed to express their personal religious beliefs and opinions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25445126}

The roof uses Welsh slate. It was designated a listed building on 2 October 1990.\n\nOn the floor of the entrance hall is a mosaic displaying the coat of arms of Middlesex (in the original form, identical to that of Essex, without the Saxon crown). Also in the entrance hall, on the staircase leading up, is a marble memorial by Nowell Parr dedicated to the local men who died in the Second Boer War.\n\nIt closed in November 2016 due to plaster falling from the roof in the children's area.

It partially reopened in January 2017, and in full in April.\n\nBrentford war memorials \n\nJust outside the library are situated several memorials dedicated to the men of Brentford who lost their lives in the First World War and the Second World War. The main memorial, unveiled in 1923, is in the form of a stone pillar. On one side is an inscription which reads:\n\nOn the other sides are the names of Brentford's First World War dead. Next to the main memorial are three smaller memorials. The middle one originally stood outside the now largely neglected St Lawrence's Church in Brentford High Street near the bridge over the Grand Union Canal. Repaired and restored, it has stood outside the Library since 19 September 2009. The other two are dedicated to the employees of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and they were moved to Brentford after the Company's works in Fulham closed in 1949.

The community Limni had a population of 2,046 in 2011. It is built at the foot of a mountain slope, on a bay of the North Euboean Gulf. It has been suggested as the site of the ancient city of Elymnion.\n\nSubdivisions\n\nThe community Limni consists of the following settlements:\nLimni\nChronia\nKatounia\nMyrtias\nRetsinolakkos\nSipias\n\nPopulation\n\nPeople\n\nLimni was the home of the independence fighter Angelis Govios, Greek resistance activist Lela Karagianni and the film director and screenwriter Nikos Tsiforos. In 1959 the English writer Philip Sherrard bought part of disused magnesite mine near Limni, planted trees and plants where the former mine installations had been, and restored the abandoned homes of the former directors who had lived there before the Second World War. From 1977 until his death in 1995 it was his permanent home.  Greek-American real estate magnate George M.

The term Limni is believed to have derived from the Greek word for \"lake\". This is probably due to the presence of a large lake in the area, the Limni Evian Gulf, which is the largest lake in Euboea. The majority of the population live in the villages of Kato Limni, Agios Constantinos and Mesokampi. The economy of Limni relies largely on agriculture and tourism. The fertile plains of Kato Limni and Agios Constantinos produce a variety of crops such as wheat, barley, olives, cotton and grapes. The picturesque coastal areas are also a popular destination for holiday makers, especially in the summer months. The area has been inhabited since ancient times. There were two ancient cities on the south side of the lake, Isolas and Logaras. The two were eventually abandoned in the 4th century BC. Remains of their walls, tombs and other buildings still exist. The south side of the lake became an important archaeological site in the 20th century. Archaeologists have discovered several ceramic artifacts which date back to the Middle Neolithic period. Excavations conducted in the area have also revealed evidence of an ancient civilization which inhabited the area in prehistoric times. Limni has many other monuments and points of interest. The Monastery of Zoodochos Pigi is an important religious site. It was built in the 17th century and is located on the outskirts of the town. Other attractions include the Zogonia Springs and the Hill of the Sun. In recent times, Limni has seen increased economic activity and development.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mortal Kombat (comics)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mortal Kombat comic books series included the official Mortal Kombat comics by Midway and a licensed adaptation series by Malibu Comics that was published in 1994-1995. There are thus two different lineups of Mortal Kombat comics: the tie-ins published by Midway (some of them made by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias) and DC Comics that closely followed the storyline of the games, and the Malibu series, which took a few liberties with the source material.\n\nComics published by Midway Games\nThe Midway comics were tie-ins published to coincide with the launches of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 4. They offered insight into the backstory to each of the games as well as providing exposition of events occurring before each game.\n\nMortal Kombat Collector's Edition \nMortal Kombat Collector's Edition\nMidway's comic book prologue to the original Mortal Kombat was only released by mail order when the original arcade version was released in 1992. The mail order deal was displayed during the attract mode of the game. (This mode of advertising was also used in Mortal Kombat II.) The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was close to impossible to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was written and illustrated by John Tobias, the early Mortal Kombat series' designer artist. The final few pages offer character profiles for the seven playable characters in the original MK and the boss, Goro.\n\nThe comic begins by filling in the backstory of Shang Tsung, the Great Kung Lao, and Goro, whose victory in Mortal Kombat had meant a new dark era for the tournament. In the present day, where Liu Kang receives permission from Master Wu to fight in Mortal Kombat. Two weeks later, in Hong Kong, he boards a boat that will take him to the tournament island. Johnny Cage is also seen there, reassuring his agent and personal secretary who are afraid for his safety and the legitimacy of the tournament. Meanwhile, Kano and some members of his Black Dragon attempt to evade Sonya Blade, Agent Beran (whose name is not revealed here), and a man who is apparently Jax, as well as the rest of a U.S. Special Forces unit. Chased by Sonya, Kano leaps aboard the boat, all in accordance with his plan to loot all the riches he can find from Shang Tsung's palace.\n\nIn the mountains of rural Japan, Shang Tsung issues a challenge to Raiden, God of Thunder, inviting him to compete and reminding him that the tournament will be fought in his domain and under his rule. Back on the boat, Kano is trying to intimidate Cage and a fight breaks out, during which Liu Kang takes down Kano's associates. Sub-Zero watches the scene from above, unaware of the lurking spectre of Scorpion, who ambushes him from behind. Scorpion vows to kill Sub-Zero just as Sub-Zero killed Scorpion exactly two years ago. However, he states he is no mere murderer and, instead of killing the Sub-Zero on the boat, he will do so at the tournament. Sub-Zero says Scorpion is a fool to spare his life.\n\nAt the island, after a day of practice and training, Shang Tsung and Goro welcome the participants in the tournament and introduce the latest entrant, Sonya Blade, who had been trying to track Kano down to the island, but was captured and brought in by guards. Shang Tsung says that not only does Sonya's life depend on her performance, but so do the lives of her accompanying unit, who have also been captured. Goro then announces the start of the tournament and the story ends with the caption \"To be continued...at an arcade near you!\"\n\nMortal Kombat II Collector's Edition\nMidway's comic book prologue to Mortal Kombat II was published by mail order during the release of the arcade version, much like with the original game's comic. Likewise, the second comic book reflects the events that were raised in the game and was also written, penciled, and colored by John Tobias. 100 million copies are said to had been printed.\n\nThe story begins with Johnny Cage recounting the events of the first game's final moments. He explains that Shang Tsung unleashed a horde of warriors on the Earthrealm fighters following Liu Kang's victory over Goro; and that Kano, Sonya, and himself were rushed by Goro at The Pit. Suddenly, an explosion knocked out the bridge from underneath them and everyone fell. Cage was saved, however, by Raiden, who informed him that Liu Kang had killed Shang Tsung and the island, which was held together by Tsung's presence, is self-destructing. Raiden further elaborates that Liu Kang has already escaped and, following the battle with Shang Tsung's army, Sub-Zero was killed by Scorpion, who then burst into flames and burned to ash before Raiden's eyes. The ensuing explosion apparently knocked Cage out and the next thing he recalls is seeing a U.S. military vessel. As it turns out, Cage has been telling the story to a disbelieving Jax and Lt. Steve Beran (a reference to Mortal Kombat series art director Steve Beran), who is more open to the story considering Cage has recounted the story five times with exactly the same details each time. Jax does not believe Cage's story on account of a distress signal from Sonya pinpointed to where they found Cage and because he thinks Sonya would never fight alongside Kano, even if, as Cage says, she had no choice. He nevertheless releases Cage due to lack of evidence.And \n\nMeanwhile, in Outworld, Shao Kahn is being addressed by King Gorbak, who laments his son, Goro's, apparent death and places the blame on the shoulders of Shang Tsung, who is alive in Outworld. Gorbak calls for Tsung's death, but Kahn gives the him one chance to impress upon him why he should not personally slay him. Tsung instantly comes up with a plan: to lure the Earthrealm warriors to Outworld by breaching the dimensional gate and challenging them to Mortal Kombat. Only this time, the tournament will take place in Outworld and will be against the wishes of the Elder Gods. Kahn consults a Shadow Priest for advice and is told that due to the plan being against the wishes of the Elder Gods, it is impossible to clearly foresee the outcome. Should Kahn be victorious, his power will be unmatched and he will live for eternity. If the plan fails, however, Kahn will face eternal damnation. Gorbak says that if Tsung is to live then he will offer the services of Kintaro. As Shang Tsung's presence on Earthrealm no longer exists, Shao Kahn gives him a new physical form, one that is much younger in appearance. Kahn then sends Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Kintaro, and Shang Tsung to destroy the Shaolin Monastery.\n\nAt the Special Forces base, a recording is received from Sonya and Kano that confirms Cage's story as true. Jax decides to make a trip to Hollywood to track down Cage. In China, Liu Kang has returned to Shaolin to find it ruined. The apparent sole survivor of the attacks, Kung Lao, appears from the shadows and sides with his friend by offering his word that he will fight against Outworld. At that moment, a Lin Kuei hover jet lands and a man in a suit claiming to be Sub-Zero hands Liu Kang his calling card. Liu Kang states that he saw Sub-Zero die and this man cannot possibly be the same person, but the ninja says he is the brother of the original Sub-Zero and remarks that his brother's unwillingness to adapt to technological change within the Lin Kuei is what made him obsolete. He shows the monks surveillance pictures the Lin Kuei took of Shang Tsung who appears to be searching for Cage, and the three then decide to journey to Hollywood. Cage is on set, filming a commercial for \"Cage Cologne.\" (The director's name is \"E. Boon\" and bears resemblance to the franchise co-creator of the same name whilst the cameraman looks like fellow co-creator John Tobias.) At this point, Shang Tsung and the Outworld warriors sent by Kahn, flanked by numerous Masked Guards, arrive through a portal in the studio. As Jax and Beran demand to see Cage, he is blasted through the wall right in front of them and a massive fight breaks out. Sub-Zero's hover jet arrives about this time, being piloted by Smoke and a red-clad Lin Kuei member. Kung Lao and Liu Kang join the fight on Jax's side. Sub-Zero (now in his ninja uniform) leaps down and makes an attempt on Shang Tsung's life, but rebounds off an invisible Reptile. Before Reptile can kill Sub-Zero, however, Scorpion intervenes and attacks Reptile, saying he will defend Sub-Zero as penance for killing his brother. Before anything else can happen, though, Raiden arrives to stop the conflict. Shang Tsung now makes his challenge before returning to Outworld with his allies, leaving the Earthrealm warriors with the choice of accepting the challenge or forfeiting. Raiden informs Liu Kang that forfeit would weaken Earthrealm's standing with the Elder Gods and Liu Kang must accept the challenge. Jax is reluctant to join the tournament but is spurred on when Cage reveals Beran has been killed by Mileena. Sub-Zero also offers to compete. Raiden tells the gathered group of Jax, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, and Sub-Zero to \"Prepare yourselves, Mortals—for Kombat in the Outworld!\" The comic ends with the caption, \"To be continued on a game screen near you!\"\n\nMortal Kombat 4 Limited Edition\nThis comic book/artbook hybrid was created jointly by artists Alé Garza, Tomm Coker, Keron Grant, Garry Leach, Steve Pugh, and Mark Texeira. It was produced as a tie-in to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of Mortal Kombat 4, initially available as a pre-order incentive, and was later packaged with the PC CD-ROM version of the game.\n\nShinnok, ruler of the Netherrealm, is the first to emerge from the portal, followed by hundreds of demons, as well as the mysterious Reiko, and Scorpion, who is likely looking for another chance at life outside the Netherrealm. As Quan Chi, the one who gave Sindel the orb, discusses the success of the plan and says Tanya is to be thanked, Shinnok claims his true goal is to reach the heavens and confront the Elder Gods, and now he has that chance.\n\nSeveral days later, in Earthrealm, Sub-Zero has travelled to the Temple of the Elements in China. He recalls what his elder brother, the original Sub-Zero, said: that the temple is home to an amulet designed to keep Shinnok in the Netherrealm. The amulet is protected by the elements of Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire (a reference to Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero). As Sub-Zero prepares to make peace with the elemental Gods, he sees what he believes to be a sign falling from the sky and decides to follow it after symbolically donning his mask once more out of respect not to the Lin Kuei, but to his brother. Miles away, Liu Kang quickly gets the upper hand, Kai jokes that this is easy enough for the Immortal Champion of Mortal Kombat. Suddenly, what Sub-Zero had seen falling from the sky collides with the ground near the monks. They inspect the scene and discover demons about to slit the throat of a white-haired man. Elsewhere, Sonya Blade is battling Jarek. Unable to get the upper hand over the last remaining Black Dragon clan member, Jarek escapes. Jax then contacts Sonya and tells her she is needed to investigate an interdimensional flux in southwestern China and a helicopter piloted by Johnny Cage is sent to pick her up. At the crater, Liu Kang and Kai battle the demons until Raiden shows up and destroys the demons. Raiden then explains that the man who fell from the sky is Fujin, God of Wind. He elaborates that he and Fujin are the last two remaining of Earth's Gods and that the Elder Gods have been weakened by Shinnok. He and Fujin withdraw to the Eternal Palace to formulate a plan of attack, after telling Liu Kang and Kai they must go to Edenia. Just as Kai is lamenting the impossibility of such a task, the helicopter carrying Sonya and Cage arrives. Sub-Zero too shows up to offer his help, correctly guessing that his brother may have played some part in Shinnok's return. Sonya uses Outer World Investigation Agency technology to open a portal to Edenia.

The series debuted in January 2015.\n\nBlood Ties begins several years after the end of the \"Netherrealm War\", when Shinnok led Netherrealm in an attempt to conquer Earth and the other realms in the wake of Shao Khan's death. Shinnok was defeated and his undead armies pushed back, save for a number of dead warriors who were restored to life. Meanwhile, Outworld fell into a civil war as Mileena was overthrown by her warchief Kotal Kahn. In the Himalayan wilderness, Kenshi and his son Takeda flee from members of the Red Dragon and are saved by Scorpion and his rebuilt Shirai Ryu clan. Kenshi explains that he was infiltrating the Red Dragon when he was exposed, causing the group to target his son, whom he did not know he had. Kenshi leaves Takeda with Scorpion and leaves to complete his mission and find the Red Dragon's leader. Meanwhile, Kuai Liang, the younger Sub-Zero (who has also been returned to life) attacks a Red Dragon Temple in China. He enters the inner chamber only to be attacked by Kano, who has taken the Kamidogu (which are daggers in this timeline) within and scars him with it, stating that the Kamidogu are cursed. \n\nYears later, Scorpion is approached by Raiden. After ensuring the Kamidogu is safe, he warns Scorpion of a demon from another realm that seeks to kill Earth's champions. Takeda's friend Fox is driven mad by voices: taking the Kamidogu, he is possessed by the demon and kills the rest of the Shirai Ryu, before being killed by Takeda and Scorpion. After paying their respects to the fallen, the two leave to find Raiden to seek answers. At the Sky Temple, Raiden converses with the Wind God Fujin, before using another dagger to invoke blood magic to find the demon. He discovers that they are too late and that events are already in motion. At a Special Forces base, Sonya Blade meets with Kotal Khan, Emperor of Outworld, who was captured entering Earth. Kotal explains that Mileena's resistance in Outworld is in league with the Red Dragon, and that he and his warriors are there to eliminate them. He asks for their cooperation, though Sonya refuses, and a fight ensues, but Raiden intervenes and Kotal departs, threatening to make them pay. Elsewhere, Sonya's daughter Cassie Cage, takes Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs to what she believes to be a legal fight club, but are forced into an illegal death match against Frost. The match is interrupted by Black Dragon members Jarek and Tasia, who attempt to take Cassie and Jacqui. The two are sucked through a portal, but Cassie is able to take a picture of one of their abductors from her phone, Erron Black, one of the warriors who had been with Kotal, leaving it for Sonya. Sonya finds Cassie's phone and prepares to take her men and Johnny Cage (Cassie's father) to Outworld.\n\nIn Outworld, Kotal Khan sends his father to find Prince Goro who has disappeared while looking for Mileena. Unknown to Kotal, Goro has betrayed him and joined Mileena. Goro kills Kotal's father, driving Kotal to empower himself with his Kamidogu and face Goro personally, tearing his arms off. As Kotal and his warriors leave, they are confronted by Sonya demanding her daughter's location. Kotal denies involvement but agrees to help after Erron Black is shown to be involved. Elsewhere, Erron, Kano and the Black Dragon are taking Jacqui and Cassie to an unknown location when they are ambushed by Mavado and the Red Dragon. Kano abandons Erron who is wounded and the girls kill Mavado before being taken prisoner once more. In Earthrealm, Scorpion and Takeda near the Sky Temple and are attacked by Raiden, who is under the effects of the Kamidogu's curse. Takeda is seemingly killed, causing Scorpion to savagely beat Raiden, freeing him from the curse. Raiden saves Takeda's life and explains that following Shinnok's defeat the Elder Gods locked him away in another dimension. The Kamidogu were empowered with Blood Magic to act as the keys to his prison, and entrusted to powerful warriors by Raiden, keeping their true purpose and power hidden. Scorpion is furious at the deception. Raiden apologizes, explaining that he had not foreseen the demon corrupting the magic and cursing the blades. He informs him that all the blades are accounted for, save for one which has been stolen by Sub-Zero, who was possessed when Kano scarred him with one years earlier, and Scorpion agrees to help track him down. In Outworld, Mileena's chief advisor Reiko plots with the demon cleric Havik, who promises to grant him the power to become ruler of Outworld if he brings him the Kamidogu. Meanwhile, Sonya's team finds Erron Black who delivers a message that Reiko and Havik are waiting for them on Shang Tsung's island.\n\nMortal Kombat X: Blood Gods\n\nMortal Kombat X: Blood Island\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Mortal Kombat at Comic Vine\n\nComics based on video games\nDC Comics titles\nMartial arts comics\nScience fantasy comics\nWorks based on Mortal Kombat", "machine_text": " Mortal Kombat is a series of comic books published by DC Comics based on the popular Mortal Kombat video game series.

It is a classic morality tale about a gun that is so powerful it can even kill the gods. The story of the Golden Gun usually follows one of four possible storylines, depending on the version which is being told. The first plot involves a mighty king who seeks a weapon capable of defeating all other guns. The king embarks on a quest to locate and obtain the Golden Gun, eventually succeeding with the help of a magic rat. The magic rat then reveals the secret of how to wield the Golden Gun against any foe. The second rendition of the tale involves two legendary guns, the Golden Gun and the Iron Gun. Both the Golden Gun and the Iron Gun are said to be irresistibly powerful but each has a specific purpose. For example, the Golden Gun can only be used for good while the Iron Gun can only be used for evil. The two guns battle each other until eventually the Golden Gun is the victor and the one wielding it is rewarded with wealth and power. In other versions, the two guns may be portrayed as being wielded by two adversaries as a way to settle their disagreements. The two guns exchange fire until finally only one remains standing and is declared the winner. The mythology of the Golden Gun revolves around the notion that it has the power to bestow great fortune and unimaginable power to its owner. As such, the Golden Gun is often sought after by those who desire great power. Of course, the story includes a warning: that ultimate power should not be abused lest one incur the wrath of the gods or suffer fatal consequences. The Legend of the Golden Gun is an example of the many stories and myths that have been passed down from generation to generation. It serves to remind us of the power of the gun and the consequences of wielding it. It is a story with strong morals that cautions us not to seek too much power and reminds us to use our power wisely.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31132665}

Before being elected the City Council President, he served as a delegate to the Maryland House of Delegates from 1967 to 1968. Orlinsky was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Maryland in 1978.\n\nAfter accepting a cash bribe in 1982 from a hauler which sought a city contract to transport sludge to Western Maryland, Orlinsky pled guilty to one charge of extortion. He was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which he served  months in the Allenwood Federal Prison.  Orlinsky received a pardon from President Bill Clinton in 2000.  After his release from prison Orlinsky worked as a restaurant maître d', a vendor at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and executive director of a tree-planting program of the Maryland Forest Service.

While in the Maryland State Senate, Orlinsky led the opposition to the Vietnam War and was the chief architect of civil rights legislation during the Civil Rights Movement. On the national stage, he served as the chief U.S. negotiator in the Middle East peace process and derailed several government policies in the 1970s. Early Life and Education Orlinsky was born to a Jewish family in Austria in 1917. His mother was a seamstress and his father was an X-Ray operator. When the Nazi regime invaded Austria in 1938, Orlinsky's family fled the country to find refuge in England. Two years later, at the age of twenty-three, he immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland and graduated from City College of Baltimore in 1941. Career After graduation, Orlinsky began his legal career by serving as a public defender in Baltimore. In 1947, he was elected to the Maryland State Senate and represented Baltimore's third district. He served as the Senate majority leader from 1967 to 1969. During his term in the Senate, Orlinsky passed landmark legislation protecting the civil rights of African Americans and increasing efforts for Vietnam War protests. He was one of the first state-level elected officials to take an anti-war stance and was heavily involved in the state's anti-war movement. In 1970, Governor Marvin Mandel appointed Orlinsky to serve as the Secretary of State of Maryland. In that role, he helped negotiate the Middle East peace process and draft several agreements, including the Sinai II Accord. Orlinsky resigned his post as Secretary of State in 1976 in order to challenge Donald Frazier as the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate.

The team was coached by Bo Pelini and played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska. They were members of the North Division of the Big 12 Conference. It was Nebraska's 102nd and last season in the Big 12 (including years in the MVIAA/Big Eight) as they began competing in the Big Ten Conference in 2011.\n\nThe Cornhuskers finished the season 10–4, 6–2 in the Big 12 and were co champions of the North Division with Missouri. Due to their victory over Missouri, Nebraska represented the North Division in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game where they were defeated by Oklahoma 20–23. They were invited to the Holiday Bowl for the second consecutive season and played Washington. Despite defeating the Huskies 56–21 during the regular season, the Cornhuskers were defeated 19–7.\n\nBefore the season\nThe 2010 Cornhuskers took to the field on Saturday, September 4, 2010 against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. The Cornhuskers carried on despite losing a handful of key personnel losses to graduation after 2009, especially Heisman-candidate and #2 overall NFL draft pick DT Ndamukong Suh.  The Nebraska coaching staff remained intact for the third straight year, since the return of Bo Pelini to the program.\n\nDuring the spring of this year, several NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams began publicly discussing potential conference changes, which ultimately gained enough momentum to set off a chain reaction of university conference affiliation changes.  On June 11, 2010, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln announced that its regents unanimously voted to end the university's affiliation with the Big 12 Conference, and would be joining the Big Ten Conference.  The Big Ten Conference unanimously approved Nebraska's official application just hours later, and Nebraska announced that the Cornhusker athletic programs would transition into the Big Ten conference play schedule effective July 1, 2011.  This is Nebraska's last year playing in the Big 12 Conference.\n\nNebraska's preseason #8 AP ranking was the highest starting rank for Nebraska since Eric Crouch's 2001 Heisman trophy season, which ultimately saw the Cornhuskers playing Miami in the BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl.\n\nRecruiting\n\nSchedule\n\nRoster and coaching staff\n\nGame summaries\n\nWestern Kentucky\n\nThis was the first ever meeting of the Hilltoppers and Cornhuskers.  Redshirt Freshman QB Taylor Martinez was not revealed as the starter for Nebraska until kickoff, and subsequently became the first freshman quarterback to open a Nebraska season in the history of the program.  On his first carry, Martinez rushed for 46 yards and a touchdown, paving the way for Nebraska to extend its ongoing NCAA record of consecutive season-opening victories to 25.  His 129 rushing yards on the day also marked the first time a Nebraska QB exceeded 100 yards on the ground since 2003, and this was accomplished even while sharing snaps with the second and third string quarterbacks.  The 2010 Blackshirts debut was marred somewhat when they allowed the Western Kentucky squad, which had lost their last 20 games in a row prior to this game, to accumulate 299 all-purpose yards, mostly during a second-half defensive letdown.\n\nIdaho\n\nFor the sixth straight year, Nebraska opened the season 2–0.  The 38–17 defeat of the Idaho Vandals in the first ever meeting of these teams improved the Cornhuskers to 22–1 against WAC opponents all-time.  After an unimpressive outing the week prior, the Nebraska defense came forth with a strong defensive attack, holding the Vandals to just 60 yards on the ground and 279 total yards, while notching seven sacks for 80 yards lost.  The Blackshirts intercepted five passes, three of which were converted into scores.  A 28–3 scoring output in the 2nd quarter allowed the Cornhuskers to run away with the game and play some reserve personnel, which allowed the Vandals to outscore Nebraska 14–7 in the second half. Although the Nebraska offense recorded 471 all-purpose yards, numerous miscues resulted in stalled drives and lost opportunities.  The home field win was Nebraska's 375th at Memorial Stadium, and the 500th home win in Lincoln all-time.  Nebraska redshirt freshman QB Taylor Martinez had a second straight 100-yard rushing game, and his 67-yard second-quarter touchdown was the longest by a Nebraska QB since a 70-yard dash by Eric Crouch against Colorado in 2001.  Cornhusker PK Alex Henery accounted for eight points on the day, which was enough to make him the fifth Nebraska player to ever exceed 300 career points.  Despite the win, Nebraska slipped from #6 to #8 in the AP Poll following the game.\n\nWashington, September 2010\n\nWashington was in the second year of a rebuilding project under 2nd-year coach Steve Sarkisian, who took over in 2009 after Washington finished 0–12 the year before, when Nebraska arrived for the first Cornhusker road game of the 2010 season.  Despite Nebraska's #8 AP ranking, the spread was less than ten points in favor of the Cornhuskers as the week leading up to the game. Factoring into the spread was Nebraska's redshirt freshman QB making only his third start ever, and first on the road.  The stature of senior Washington QB Jake Locker also played into the previews, as Locker was considered a top NFL prospect and an early candidate for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nWashington received the ball to start the game but gave up an interception four plays later, just 1:35 into the game. Shortly thereafter Nebraska scored a touchdown and never gave up the lead for the rest of the game.  The Cornhuskers finished the day with 533 all-purpose yards, more than double Washington's totals in each category. This included three Nebraska players totaling over 100 yards of rushing, an accomplishment not met since 2001 and only the fourth time ever in program history. It was also the first time Washington had ever allowed three opponent players to exceed 100 rushing yards. The Cornhusker offense managed over 13 yards per pass attempt and over 7 yards per rush attempt, while the 56 total Nebraska points was the most points ever scored by a non-conference opponent in Husky Stadium's 90-year history, also tying the most points ever scored there by a Washington conference opponent.  An 80-yard touchdown run in the 3rd quarter by Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez was the longest TD run by a freshman QB, and the second-longest run by any Nebraska QB, in program history.  The Blackshirts coverage prevented the Huskies from ever getting consistent momentum, and the highly touted Locker ended the day only 4 of 20 in the air for 70 yards and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a Nebraska TD by junior CB Alfonzo Dennard.  The sole highlight of the day for Washington was ending Nebraska's 10-game streak of holding opponents to 20 points or less.  Nebraska took over the series by moving to 4–3–1 against Washington all time.\n\nSouth Dakota State\n\nMeeting for the first time since a 58–7 Nebraska victory in 1963, the FCS South Dakota State Jackrabbits were not intimidated by the Memorial Stadium homecoming crowd despite entering the game at 0–2, and gave the flat Cornhuskers the toughest test of the season to date.  The 307th consecutive sellout crowd at Memorial Stadium was the largest crowd that the Jackrabbits team had ever played in front of, and the last two teams to hold Nebraska to fewer than 17 points had been the #20 Oklahoma Sooners and #3 Texas Longhorns.  The game was closer than the 17–3 score would indicate, as the Jackrabbits had two touchdowns nullified by penalties, one of them on an interception returned 66 yards to the end zone.  The large contingent of visiting fans from South Dakota were clearly heard chanting \"Let's Go Rabbits\" in the stadium as the home crowd was silenced by the spirited fight of the visiting team.  While both teams suffered two interceptions each, Nebraska offered up four fumbles on the day, losing one of them to a fumble-free South Dakota State.  Nebraska held the time of possession edge on the game by only 11 seconds, and converted only four of thirteen third downs.  Cornhusker head coach Pelini summed up the Nebraska effort after the game, saying \"We were a bad team.\"  Nonetheless, the win moved the Cornhuskers to 2–0 over the Jackrabbits all time, and put Nebraska at 4–0 for the first time since 2005.\n\nKansas State\n\nNebraska met Kansas State in Manhattan to open the final Cornhusker Big 12 Conference slate.  It was the 95th time the teams had met, and the last time unless they are matched against each other in a future non-conference game or bowl game.  Redshirt freshman Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez bounced back from his lackluster appearance in the previous contest against South Dakota State, rushing for four touchdowns and 241 yards to set a new all-time Cornhusker quarterback single-game rushing record.  His 370 total yards on the day were the most all-purpose yards set by a Cornhusker freshman at any position in nineteen years.  Martinez's efforts helped propel Nebraska to tally more yards against Kansas State than any other opponent in twenty one years.  The Wildcat offense seemed to have success to start the game, marching down the field on their first possession, until they were stopped on a 4th-and-2 in the Nebraska red zone with no points to show for it.  The Blackshirts subsequently took control of the game defensively, notching their 13th straight game holding an opponent to 21 points or less and helping the Cornhuskers to hand Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder a home field loss, in the stadium named after him, on his 71st birthday.  The Nebraska win moved the Cornhuskers to 5–0 for the first time since 2003, and the series between the programs drew to a close with a Nebraska advantage of 78–15–2.\n\nTexas\n\nThese teams came head-to-head for the 14th time in what has frequently been a contentious – if still respectful – clash of conference foes whose games often carry title implications, and often at the expense of the Cornhuskers.  2010 was no exception, as unranked Texas defeated #5 Nebraska in Lincoln, in front of a fired-up home crowd that had long anticipated this contest.  The loss leaves Nebraska 4–10 against Texas all time, and just 1–9 in the last ten attempts.  With Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last regular season league meeting of these teams.  Unless they meet again in a future bowl game, there are no scheduled dates for these programs to meet again in the future.\n\nOklahoma State\n\nThe Cornhuskers traveled to Stillwater following a high-profile disappointing loss to Texas the week prior, hoping to bounce back against their first ranked opponent of the year, the #17 Oklahoma State Cowboys. Nebraska QB Taylor Martinez eclipsed the 300-yard mark through the air for the first time in his career, passing for 323 yards and five touchdowns, while adding 112 yards on the ground.\n\nNebraska's victory improved the Cornhuskers' series lead to 37–5–1, but was only Nebraska's second win in the last five matches between the squads. Their first win in Stillwater since 1995. With Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last league meeting of these teams in a series that dates back to when the Cowboys briefly joined the MVIAA from 1925 to 1928. Oklahoma State later returned to the league for good in 1958, leading the conference to be known as the \"Big 8\" for the first time.\n\nMissouri\n\n#7 Missouri arrived in Lincoln to take on Nebraska for the 104th contest between the schools since 1892, trying to make progress to catch up to Nebraska in the series. The Tigers trail behind the Cornhuskers 36–65–3 all-time.\n\nNebraska's withdrawal from Big 12 play after this year ends a historical league affiliation with the Tigers that dates to 1892, when these two programs joined with Kansas and Iowa to form the Western Interstate University Football Association (WIUFA).  Though the WIUFA disbanded after six seasons, all four WIUFA teams came together again with the formation of the MVIAA in 1907.  The conclusion of the 2010 season will mark the end of a 103-year continuous conference partnership, and leaves the fate of the Victory Bell in question.\n\nIowa State\n\nSecond-year Iowa State Head Coach Paul Rhoads hosted Nebraska in Ames for the first time, as the squads come together for their 105th contest. With Nebraska leaving Big 12 play after this season, this game marked the end of a historical series and conference relationship dating back to 1896, almost as far back as the Nebraska-Missouri series. Nebraska, who leads the all-time series 86–17–2, avenged last year's 7–9 loss, which was Iowa State's first win in Lincoln in 34 years. Nebraska and Iowa State traded scores in the 4th quarter before Nebraska led 31–24 in the final minutes. Iowa State scored a touchdown to make the score 31–30 Nebraska leading. ISU Head Coach Paul Rhoads called a 2-point conversion. With the game on the line, ISU QB Austen Arnaud threw a pass that got intercepted by Nebraska DB Eric Hagg to give Nebraska the overtime win in Ames.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas traveled to Lincoln to play the 105th and last game in the NCAA-record longest consecutive season series in all of college football.  This game marked the 117th time overall that the teams have come together to settle things on the field.  Nebraska's victory leaves the series closed for now with a decisive Cornhusker advantage of 91–23–3. It was the first meeting between Kansas and Nebraska since the Jayhawk program was taken over by former legendary Nebraska quarterback Turner Gill.\n\nThe departure of Nebraska from the Big 12 marked this game as the probable last game of one of the longest continuous series in the history of NCAA college football, as Kansas and Nebraska have met on the field every year without interruption since 1903, and failed to meet in only two seasons overall since 1892.  No future meetings are scheduled, and the teams are unlikely to see the same field again unless they meet in a future non-conference game or are both selected to meet in a postseason bowl game.\n\nTexas A&M\n\nWith Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 Conference following this season, this was the last league meeting of these two teams. The Cornhuskers were penalized 16 times for 145 yards and lost the game 9–6. Several of the calls were controversial, and played key role in the outcome of the game. For example, Texas A&M player Tony Jerod-Eddie grabbed and squeezed the testicles of Nebraska player Ben Cotton when he recovered a fumble, and Cotton was flagged 15 yards when he tried to protect himself.\n\nFollowing the Cornhuskers' defeat by the Aggies, Nebraska Defensive Coordinator Carl Pelini was involved in an incident with Brandon Jones, a co-owner of a Texas A&M sports site, TexAgs. The photographer stated that Pelini had seized Brandon's camera and broken several pieces from it before throwing them to the ground. Video shows Pelini rushing towards the photographer and camera.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado traveled to Lincoln as both teams closed their regular seasons.  This series has produced many amazing and emotional finishes, but this 69th clash was not in doubt for long as Nebraska steadily pulled away for the win to clinch the Big 12 Conference North Division Title and a berth in the Big 12 Championship game.  Colorado was denied a sixth win for the season and thus did not attain bowl eligibility, making this the final game of their 2010 season.  As 2010 was the final year for both teams in the Big 12, the long-running series has drawn to a close with Nebraska in command at 49–18–2.\n\nOklahoma\n\nFor the second year in a row, Nebraska appeared in the Big 12 football championship game.  The team would play their final game as members of the Big 12 against Oklahoma in Arlington, Texas. Nebraska led 17–0 at one point in the first half, before Oklahoma reeled off 17 points of their own. A field goal just before halftime sent Nebraska into halftime with a 20–17 lead. In the second half, Oklahoma held Nebraska scoreless for the first time of the season and managed two field goals in each of the latter periods to win 23–20. Nebraska had 4 turnovers in the game and Oklahoma held a 453–293 yard disadvantage.\n\nWashington–Holiday Bowl\n\nFollowing Nebraska's loss to Oklahoma, Nebraska was selected as the Big 12's representative at the 2010 Holiday Bowl, which also chose the Washington squad beaten by Nebraska in September, now 6–6, to appear as the final opponent in the Cornhuskers 2010 season. This was Nebraska's second straight Holiday Bowl appearance. Washington had rebounded from a 3–6 start and the demoralizing early season loss to Nebraska, winning out the rest of their season to earn a bowl bid. The Huskies held Nebraska to a single first-half touchdown on their way to winning 19–7.\n\nRankings\n\nAfter the season\nAlthough there were high hopes for the year, three major goals were not achieved and resulted in a season that ended with a note of disappointment.  After the last-second, one-point loss to Texas in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the squad looked forward to a chance to avenge the loss against the Longhorns and to return to the league title game for the final Big 12 conference championship.  The 2010 Big 12 Championship game was the last league title game for the foreseeable future, as the departure of Nebraska and Colorado from the league dropped the number of members to ten, which is not enough to hold a title game under NCAA rules.\n\nTexas started the season flat and had to face unbeaten Nebraska in Lincoln, which led many media analysts to predict an easy Nebraska win.  Instead, Texas took advantage of Cornhusker mistakes to deny Nebraska a win in the final foreseeable match between the teams.  The Cornhuskers remained on track for an appearance in the Big 12 championship game, clinching an appearance against historical rival Oklahoma.  The Cornhuskers started strong and led 17–0 in the second quarter before the Sooners rallied for 23 points while holding Nebraska to just one more field goal.  Having also lost to Texas A&M in the regular season, the 10–3 Nebraska team was invited to the Holiday Bowl for a rematch with Washington.\n\nHead coach Bo Pelini, 3–0 in bowls all time, was handed his first ever bowl loss at the hands of an inspired Husky squad, and Nebraska suffered its third loss in the previous four games, a mark last seen since the first part of 2008.  Nonetheless, Pelini's overall record improved on the season, to 30–12 (.714) overall, and 17–7 (.708) in the Big 12, and his team won the Big 12 North Division title in each of his three seasons at the helm so far.  This was not as successful a start as the programs of successful former head coaches Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, or Frank Solich, but was a dramatic improvement over the first three years of his immediate predecessor, Bill Callahan.  Callahan managed to get to just 22–15 (.595) overall and 13–11 (.542) in the league, with  only a single division championship.  Although 2010 ended on a disappointing note following Pelini's 2009 proclamation that \"Nebraska was back\", it was apparent that Nebraska's fortunes had improved since Pelini's 2007 arrival.\n\nDraft picks, signees, or other future professional players\n Prince Amukamara, 2011 1st–round pick of the New York Giants\n DeJon Gomes, 2011 5th–round pick of the Washington Redskins\n Eric Hagg, 2011 7th–round pick of the Cleveland Browns\n Roy Helu, 2011 4th–round pick of the Washington Redskins\n Alex Henery, 2011 4th–round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles\n Ricky Henry, 2011 UFL 1st–round pick of the Hartford Colonials\n D.J.

The team was coached by Bo Pelini and played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska. The Cornhuskers finished the season 10–4, 6–2 in Big Ten play and were co-Big Ten Champions with Wisconsin and Michigan State and were invited to the Holiday Bowl, where they defeated Washington 19–7. During the season, the Cornhuskers were favored to win the Big 12 North and compete in the Big 12 Championship game for the seventh consecutive year. However, due to the realignment of the Big 12 Conference, the Cornhuskers left the conference to join the Big Ten. Despite this dramatic shift, the Cornhuskers had a successful season; the team was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll eight times and earned a #14 final ranking in the AP poll. Offensively, the 2010 Cornhuskers posted some of the best offensive stats in school history. Quarterback Taylor Martinez set single-season records for passing yards, completing 176 of 298 passes for 2,302 yards and 18 touchdowns. His favorite target was Niles Paul who set a school record for receptions in a single season with 58 for 693 yards. Running back Roy Helu, Jr. rushed for 1,245 yards and added 320 receiving yards. He was the first Cornhusker to post over 1,000 yards and 300 yards receiving in the same season. Defensively, the 2010 Cornhuskers were among the best in the Big Ten. Linebacker Lavonte David led the team with 133 tackles, while defensive end Cameron Meredith posted a team-leading nine sacks. The Cornhuskers finished the season 11th in the nation, allowing 305.6 yards per game. The 2010 Cornhuskers' success earned them a place in Nebraska school history; the team was named the NCAA Team of the Year by Sports Illustrated and won the AFCA Academic Achievement Award. The team was also honored with the 2011 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year award and the Sugar Bowl Game of the Century award. The 2010 Cornhuskers were inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in June 2012. In August 2017, the Cornhuskers unveiled the 2010 team's statue for display at Memorial Stadium. The statue, with Taylor Martinez and Roy Helu, Jr. holding the Big Ten Championship trophy, pays homage to the impact the 2010 team had on Nebraska football.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22481915}

It was the second most popular onsen area in Tottori Prefecture during the beginning of the Shōwa era.\n\nHot spring type\nTōgō Onsen is classified as a chloride and sulfate type hot spring, with a spring source temperature of 85 to 94 degrees Celsius.\n\nTōgō Onsen’s hot spring waters can be found near Matsuzaki station. Here, there is a 300-meter deep cavity in the layer of granite bedrock. This cavity is filled in with conglomerate sedimentary rock, called the Oshikagawa pyroclastic layer, along with diluvium and alluvium layers on top of it. Tōgō Onsen’s water originates from the granite, Oshikagawa, and diluvium layers, and its heat source is thought to be waste heat from the granite layer.\n\nDescription\nThere is a large multipurpose health resort at the edge of Tōgō Lake. Nearby is Japan’s largest Chinese garden, Enchō-en. The main hot spring resort area is to the east, where several Japanese ryokan inns operated up until and during Shōwa period. Currently, only two establishments, Yōshōkan and the town-managed Suimeisō, are in operation. Hot spring water flows out of the central part of the lake, causing steam to hang over its surface.\n\nThere are two ashiyu footbaths in the area, which are free for anyone to use. At Tōgō-Hawai Seaside Park, there is a hot water fountain that can be used to create boiled eggs, known as onsen tamago. The other footbath is at Lake Tōgō Lakeside Park, which also has a station for making onsen tamago. According to figures reported by the local government, Tōgō Onsen reached its peak number of visitors from the early to mid-1970’s, with more than 350,000 visitors per year. In contrast, most other hot spring areas within Tottori Prefecture reached their peak visitor count from the late 1980’s to 1993.\n\nHistory\nThe existence of the hot spring was referenced in a document written in 1749. At the time, hot spring water was drawn out by bamboo tubes inserted into the bottom of the lake, in conjunction with bamboo gates. Other documents show that the residents of Kami-Asozu village in modern-day Yurihama received permission from the Tottori Domain to draw water from the hot spring in 1843; during the Ansei Period, the hot spring water was used to treat low back pain.\n\nThe origins of Tōgō Onsen\n\nUse of the hot springs for bathing began in 1868, at the start of the Meiji Period; in 1872, a large bath tub was constructed on Ryūyu-tō Island, which was located on the lake. A wealthy local farmer created a well for drawing spring water on the western bank of Tōgō River, as well as a separate building called the Yōshōkan, and gave access to the villagers. In 1884, this building began operating as a ryokan business. With the opening of the San'in Main Line and Matsuzaki station at the end of the Meiji Period, the number of yearly visitors reached 10,000 and the name Tōgō Onsen was given to the area. Japanese novelist Naoya Shiga once visited the Yōshōkan, and he mentions it in his short story collection Tottori. The Yōshōkan is still operating today.\n\nThe origins of Matsuzaki Onsen\nAt the start of the Taishō period, other areas near Matsuzaki station experienced an increase in onsen excavation. Around this time, many books about travel such as Japanese novelist Katai Tayama’s Nihon Isshū  (“A trip round Japan”) were being published, and public interest towards domestic travel was growing. Scientific surveys for onsen were also being conducted; this led to the discovery of a new hot spring source during the late Taishō period, located near Matsuzaki station in Tōgō River. As a result, many new inns were built. These inns became collectively known as “Matsuzaki Onsen”, and soon the names Tōgō Onsen and Matsuzaki Onsen began to appear in documents.\n\nConsolidation into Tōgō Onsen\nSoon after Matsuzaki Onsen was created, it was formed into an association with Tōgō Onsen. According to the Nihon onsen taikan (Japan Onsen Encyclopedia) published in 1939, the total number of yearly lodging guests to the association’s seven inns at the time was 62,000. This made it the second most-visited onsen district in Tottori Prefecture, following Misasa Onsen’s 80,000 guests per year to its 20 inns.\nDuring the Edo Period, the narrow lakeshore on the eastern bank of the Tōgō River was a strategically important location for military and transportation purposes, so there was a lodge there. During the Meiji Period, the area had grown to become Matsuzaki Village, and had its own local government. Similarly, Tōgō Onsen and the surrounding areas formed Tōgō Village. In 1951, Matsuzaki Village and Tōgō Village merged to become Tōgō-Matsuzaki Town; in 1953, this entity merged with surrounding villages to form Tōgō Town. After this, the names of the hot springs were consolidated into “Tōgō Onsen”.\n\nFrom the Meiji Period to the Shōwa Period, many famous people visited Tōgō Onsen, such as politicians Shigenobu Ōkuma, Shinpei Gotō, Yukio Ozaki, and Hiroshi Shimomura. Besides the aforementioned Katai Tayama and Naoya Shiga, writers such as Lafcadio Hearn, Shungetsu Ikuta, Rohan Kōda, and others have also visited.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Hawai- Tōgō Hot Spring and Ryokan Association\n Tōgō Yu-asis Ryūhōkaku\n\nHot springs of Japan\nPublic baths in Japan\nTourist attractions in Tottori Prefecture", "machine_text": " Tōgō Onsen (Japanese: 東郷温泉) is a hot spring resort located in Tōgō-mura, Akaiwa, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

Mantis belong to a large group of insects within the order Mantodea, typically characterized by a specialized head, legs adapted for gripping prey, segmented body, and remarkable praying behavior. The suborder Mantodea is comprised of many different genera and species, with Mantidae - the mantis family - counting for approximately 80% of all mantodean species. Mantises are widespread and can be found in temperate and tropical habitats around the world. Most species of mantis have a three-stage lifecycle, consisting of egg, nymph and adult stages. Females typically have a mottled brown coloration while males are usually lighter colored with longer and more active wings. During mating, the male typically performs a \"dance\" to entice the female, and the male will often perform acrobatics including somersaults to evade the female's grasp. Mantoideans exhibit a variety of behaviors, including the fascinating praying behavior in which they raise their front legs to appear as if they are in prayer. Their front legs are extremely sensitive and are used to detect nearby prey such as small flies, crickets and other small invertebrates. Thesis are both beneficial and pest species, as they generally feed on other insects. They have been introduced to many areas as a form of natural pest control, and are sometimes used in displays in gardens and zoos. Some species, such as the African Mantis, have become an invasive species in many parts of the world. In addition to its use as a form of pest control, Mantis are also popular as hobbyists. They are generally easy to keep and make an interesting addition to an insect collection. There are even specialized websites devoted to the keeping of mantids and many species of mantis have been bred in captivity. The most commonly available species of mantis are the Chinese Mantis and the European Mantis. They are popular due to their large size, attractive colors, and ease of care. Mantis can make a great addition to any insect enthusiast’s collection and provide a fascinating view into the world of hunting insects.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Origin theories of Christopher Columbus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The exact ethnic or national origin of Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) has been a source of speculation since the 19th century. The general consensus among historians is that Columbus's family was from the coastal region of Liguria, that he spent his boyhood and early youth in the Republic of Genoa, in Genoa, in Vico Diritto, and that he subsequently lived in Savona, where his father Domenico moved in 1470. Much evidence derives from data concerning Columbus's immediate family connections in Genoa and opinions voiced by contemporaries concerning his Genoese origins, which few dispute.\n\nMany other hypotheses exist, none of which are broadly accepted. \n\nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins began in 2021.\n\nGenoese origin\n\nDocuments \nIn a 1498 deed of primogeniture, Columbus writes:\n\nMany historians, including a distinguished Spanish scholar, Altolaguirre, affirm the document's authenticity; others believe it apocryphal. Some believe that the fact that it was produced in court, during a lawsuit among the heirs of Columbus, in 1578, does not strengthen the case for its being genuine.\n\nA letter from Columbus, dated 2 April 1502, to the Bank of Saint George, the oldest and most reputable of Genoa's financial institutions, begins with the words:\n\nAlthough some people consider this letter suspect, the vast majority of scholars believe it genuine. The most scrupulous examination by graphologists testifies in favour of authenticity. The letter is one of a group of documents entrusted by Columbus to a Genoese friend, after the bitter experiences of his third voyage, before setting out on his fourth.\n\nIn the spring of 1502, Columbus collected notarized copies of all the writings concerned with his rights to the discovery of new lands. He sent these documents to Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Republic of Genoa. To Oderico he also gave \"the letter to the Bank of Saint George\", in which he announced that he was leaving the bank one-tenth of his income, with a recommendation for his son Diego. Oderico returned to Genoa and delivered the letter to the bank. The bank replied on 8 December 1502, lauding the gesture of their \"renowned fellow-citizen\" towards his \"native land\". The reply, unfortunately, never reached its destination; Columbus, back in Castile after his fourth voyage, complained about this in another letter to Ambassador Oderico, dated 27 December 1504, and promptly annulled the bequest.\n\nThe first letter was preserved in the archives of the Bank of Saint George until it was taken over by the municipality of Genoa; the other three remained in the Oderico family archives until 1670, when they were donated to the Republic of Genoa. After the fall of the Republic, they passed to the library of one of its last senators, Michele Cambiaso, and were finally acquired by the city of Genoa.  There are also public and notarial acts (more than a hundred) — copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona — regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\n\nAnother doubt remains to be settled: that is, whether or not all of the documents cited concern the Christopher Columbus who was later to become Cristóbal Colón, admiral of the Ocean Sea in Spanish territory. The list of contemporary ambassadors and historians unanimous in the belief that Columbus was Genoese could suffice as proof, but there is something more: a document dated 22 September 1470 in which the criminal judge convicts Domenico Colombo. The conviction is tied to the debt of Domenico — together with his son Christopher (explicitly stated in the document) — toward a certain Girolamo del Porto. In the will dictated by Admiral Christopher Columbus in Valladolid before he died, the authentic and indisputable document which we have today, the dying navigator remembers this old debt, which had evidently not been paid. There is, in addition, the act drawn in Genoa on 25 August 1479 by a notary, Girolamo Ventimiglia. This act is known as the Assereto document, after the scholar who found it in the State Archives in Genoa in 1904. It involves a lawsuit over a sugar transaction on the Atlantic island Madeira. In it, young Christopher swore that he was a 27-year-old Genoese citizen resident in Portugal and had been hired to represent the Genoese merchants in that transaction. Here was proof that he had relocated to Portugal. It is important to bear in mind that at the time when Assereto traced the document, it would have been impossible to make an acceptable facsimile. Nowadays, with modern chemical processes, a document can be \"manufactured\", made to look centuries old if need be, with such skill that it may be difficult to prove it is a fake. In 1960, this was still impossible.\n\nIn addition to the two documents cited, there are others that confirm the identification of the Genoese Christopher Columbus, son of Domenico, with the admiral of Spain. An act dated 11 October 1496 says:\n\t\n\nIn a fourth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 8 April 1500, Sebastiano Cuneo, heir by half to his father Corrado, requested that Christopher and Giacomo (called Diego), the sons and heirs of Domenico Colombo, be summoned to court and sentenced to pay the price for two lands located in Legine. This document confirms Christoforo and Diego's absence from the Republic of Genoa with these exact words: \"dicti conventi sunt absentes ultra Pisas et Niciam.\"\n\t \nA fifth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 26 January 1501, is more explicit. A group of Genoese citizens, under oath, said and say, together and separately and in every more valid manner and guise, that Christopher, Bartholomew and Giacomo Columbus, sons and heirs of the aforementioned Domenico, their father, have for a long time been absent from the city and the jurisdiction of Savona, as well as Pisa and Nice in Provence, and that they reside in the area of Spain, as was and is well known.\n\t \nFinally, there is a very important sixth document from the notary of Bartolomeo Oddino, drawn in Savona on 30 March 1515. With this notarial act, Leon Pancaldo, the well-known Savonese who would become one of the pilots for Magellan's voyage, sends his own father-in-law in his place as procurator for Diego Columbus, son of Admiral Christopher Columbus. The document demonstrates how the ties, in part economic, of the discoverer's family with Savona survived even his death.\n\nThe life of Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand \nA biography written by Columbus's son Ferdinand (in Spanish and translated to Italian), Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo; nelle quali s'ha particolare, et vera relatione della vita, et de' fatti dell'Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre; Et dello scoprimento, ch'egli fece delle Indie Occidentali, dette Nuovo Mondo (\"Accounts of His Lordship Ferdinand Columbus; among which there are particulars and a true relation of the life, and of the deeds of the Admiral, Sir Christopher Columbus, his father; and of the discovery, which he made, of the West Indies, called the New World,\" abbreviated as \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand\"), exists.<ref>Colón, Fernando (translated by Benjamin Keen). \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus, Greenwood Press, 1978. Retrieved 2006-10-10.</ref>  \nIn it, Ferdinand claimed that his father was of Italian aristocracy. He describes Columbus to be a descendant of a Count Columbo of the Castle Cuccaro (Montferrat). Columbo was in turn said to be descended from a legendary Roman General Colonius. It is now widely believed that Christopher Columbus used this persona to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy, an elaborate illusion to mask a humble merchant background. Ferdinand dismissed the fanciful story that the Admiral descended from the Colonus mentioned by Tacitus. However, he refers to \"those two illustrious Coloni, his relatives.\" According to Note 1, on page 287, these two \"were corsairs not related to each other or to Christopher Columbus, one being Guillame de Casenove, nicknamed Colombo, Admiral of France in the reign of Louis XI\". At the top of page 4, Ferdinand listed Nervi, Cogoleto, Bogliasco, Savona, Genoa and Piacenza (all inside the former Republic of Genoa) as possible places of origin. He also stated:\n\nIn chapter ii, Ferdinand accuses Agostino Giustiniani of telling lies about the discoverer:\n\nIn chapter v, he writes:\n\nFerdinand also says (chapter xi) that before he was declared admiral, his father used to sign himself \"Columbus de Terra rubra,\" that is to say, Columbus of Terrarossa, a village or hamlet near Genoa. In another passage, Ferdinand says that his father went to Lisbon and taught his brother Bartholomew to construct sea charts, globes and nautical instruments; and sent this brother to England to make proposals to Henry VII of his desired voyage. Finally, Ferdinand says incidentally (chapter lxxii) that Christopher's brother, Bartholomew Columbus named the new settlement Santo Domingo in memory of their father, Domenico.\n\nThe publication of Historie has been used by historians as providing indirect evidence about the Genoese origin of Columbus.\n\n The testimony of the ambassadors \nIt is significant that no one protested at the court of Spain when in April 1501, in the feverish atmosphere of the great discovery, Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Genoese Republic, after praising the Catholic Sovereigns, went on to say that they \"discovered with great expenditure hidden and inaccessible places under the command of Columbus, our fellow-citizen, and having tamed wild barbarians and unknown peoples, they educated them in religion, manners and laws\". Furthermore, two diplomats from Venice — no great friend of Genoa, indeed, a jealous rival — added the appellation \"Genoese\" to Columbus's name: the first, Angelo Trevisan, in 1501, the second, Gasparo Contarini, in 1525. In 1498, Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to the English court, mentioned John Cabot, \"the discoverer, another Genoese, like Columbus\". All these references were published, along with reproductions of some of the original documents, in the City of Genoa volume of 1931.\n\n Support for the Genoese origin from contemporary European writers \nThe historian Bartolomé de las Casas, whose father traveled with Columbus on his second journey and who personally knew Columbus's sons, writes in chapter 2 of his Historia de las Indias:\n\nThe historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, writes that Domenico Colombo was the Admiral's father; and in chapter 2, book 3 of his Historia general y natural de las Indias:\n\nMany contemporary writers agree that the discoverer was Genoese:\n\nThe Portuguese Rui de Pina wrote two works, Chronica d'El Rey, dom Affonso and Chronica d'El Rey, dom João II. It has been ascertained that the manuscripts had been completed before 1504, although they were published in the Eighteenth century. Chapter 66 in the second manuscript, \"Descubrimiento das Ilhas de Castella per Collombo,\" explicitly states, \"Christovan Colombo italiano.\"\nIn the 1513 edition of the Map of the New World from Ptolemy, it says: \"This land with the adjacent islands was discovered by the Genoese Columbus, sent by the King of Castile.\"\nThe Turkish geographer Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, known as Piri Reis, in his map of 1513, writes: \"These coasts are called the coasts of the Antilles. They were discovered in the year 896 of the Arabic calendar. It is said that a Genoese infidel, Columbus by name, discovered the place.\"\nHernando Alonso de Herrera, in his anti-Aristotelian dissertation, completed in Salamanca in 1516, and published in Latin and Spanish, wrote: \"Xristoval Colon ginoves.\"\nIn a Portuguese map of 1520, it is said: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile, discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe German Peter von Bennewitz writes, in 1520, in the Typus Orbis Universalis: \"In the year 1497 (sic) this land (America) with the adjacent islands was discovered by Columbus, a Genoese by mandate of the King of Castile.\"\nThe German Johannes Schöner states in the Globus of 1520: \"This (island) produces gold, mastic, aloes, porcelain, etc. and ginger — Latitude of the island 440 miles — Longitude 880 — discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese, captain of the King of Castile in the year of Our Lord 1492.\"\nThe Spaniard Francisco López de Gómara writes: \"Christopher Columbus was originally from Cogurreo or Nervi, a village of Genoa, a very famous Italian city.\"\nThe Portuguese Garcia de Resende, poet and editor, writes: \"Christouao Colombo, italiano.\"\nThe Swiss Heinrich Glarean (Loriti) writes: \"To the west there is a land they call America. Two islands, Hispaniola and Isabella: which regions were travelled, along the coast, by the Spaniards, by the Genoese Columbus and by Amerigo Vespuzio.\"\nThe Spaniard Hieronymo Girava, who lived in the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoval Colon Genoese, great seaman and mediocre cosmographer.\"\nThe Portuguese João de Barros writes: \"As all men declare, Christovão Colom was of Genoese nation, a man expert, eloquent and good Latinist, and very boastful in his affairs\"; and: \"As in this kingdom came Christopher Columbus Genoese, who had just discovered the western islands that now we call Antilles.\"\nThe German known as Giovanni Boemo Aubano, of the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoforo Palombo, Genoese, the year 1492.\"\nThe Flemish Abraham Ortelius, writes: \"It seems to surpass the bounds of human wonder that all this hemisphere (that today is called America and, because of its immense extent, the New World) remained unknown to the ancients until the Christian year 1492, in which it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Damião de Góis, writes: \"The Genoese Columbus, a man expert in nautical arts\" ; and, in the index: \"Columbi genuen- sis, alias Coloni commendatio.\" \nThe Spaniard Nicolás Monardes, writes: \"In the year 1492 our Spaniards were led by don Christoval Colon, native of Genoa, to discover the West Indies.\"\nThe German Laurentius Surius, writes: \"There was at the court of the King of Spain a certain Christopher Columbus whose homeland was Genoa.\"\nIn 1579, for the Cristoph Pantin's edition, the yearbooks of the Genoese Senate were published, in Antwerp, edited by Petro Bizaro: Senatus Populique Genuensis rerum domi forisque gestarum historiae atque annales. Among what is written to celebrate many industrious Genoese men, you can read that: \"cum Christophoro Columbo navalis scientiae absolutissima peritia apud omnem venturam posteritatem, juro optima aliqua ex parte conferri vel comparari possit.\"\nThe Portuguese Fernão Vaz Dourado in the Atlante of 1580, notes: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Spaniard Alvaro Gomez, writes: \"Thanks to the eager industry of Christopher Columbus Genoese, word was brought to our Sovereigns of an unknown world.\"\nThe Frenchman Gilbert Génebrard, writes: \"Ferdinand, at the urging of his wife Isabella, Queen of Castile, Leòn and Aragon, sent Christopher Columbus Genoese to seek new land.\"\nThe Swiss Theodor Zwinger, who died in 1588, was the author of the Theatrum Humanae Vitae, Basle 1604. In the index we read: \"Cristoforo Colono, or Colombo Genoese.\"\nOn an unspecified date, certainly prior to 1591, the Turk Basmagi Ibrahim published a book, written by a Turkish author who has remained anonymous, entitled Turich-i-Hind-i garbi iachod hadis-i-nev (History of the West Indies, in other words the New Story). The third chapter of this book dedicated to the discoverer of the \"New World or New Land,\" states: \"From the village of Nervi, which is among the Genoese possessions, a man who was born who had the name Christopher and the surname Columbus. Since he had completed journeys by land and by sea [...] he stayed on an island by the name of Madeira [...] under the domain of the wretched (sic) Portugal.\"\nThe Flemish Theodor De Bry, writes: \"From everything it can be stated with certainty that it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Gaspar Frutuoso, in a sixteenth-century manuscript entitled As Saudades da terra, printed by Alvaro Rodriguez Azevedo in 1873 in Funchal (Madeira), writes in the Anales of Porto Santo: \"On this island the great Christovao Colombo, the Genoese, resided for some time.\"\nThe German David Chytraeus writes: \"Primum Novum Orbem in occidente, omnibus antea ignotum et inaccessam... pervestigare et aperire... Christophorus Columbus Genesis, admirand ad omnen posteritatem ausu et industria coeperat.\"\nIn the volume published by the City of Genoa the testimony is cited of the historian Andres Bernaldez, who died in 1513. He was the author of a Historia de los Reyes Catolicos don Fernando y dona Isabel. In this work, belatedly published in Seville in 1869, it is written: \"In the name of Almighty God, a man of the land of Genoa, a merchant of printed books who was called Christopher Columbus.\" Actually, in the original text of Bernaldez, it says \"land of Milan\". However, this is merely lack of precision. In the 15th century, the Republic of Genoa was alternately fully and legally dependent on the Duchy of Milan and the latter's satellite. The editor rightly interpreted the Milanese reference in the sense of Genoese origin.\n\nColumbus's Genoese birth is also confirmed by the works of the English Hakluyt (1601), of the Spaniard Antonio de Herrera (1612), the great Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega (1614), a paper manuscript dated 1626, conserved in Madrid's National Library, the works of the German Filioop Cluwer (1677), the German Giovanni Enrico Alsted (1649), the French Dionisio Petau (1724), and the Spaniard Luigi de Marmol (1667). This list represents the early writings of non-Italians. There were sixty-two Italian testimonies between 1502 and 1600. Of these fourteen are from Ligurian writers. It may be obvious, but not useless, to underline that the Venetians' (e.g. Trevisan's and Ramusio's) recognition of Columbus's Genoese birth constitutes a testimony as impartial as that of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese.\n\nConformable to the testament in Seville (3 July 1539) is the evidence of Ferdinand Columbus, who states that his father was conterraneo (of the same country) with Mons. Agostino Giustiniani, who was, beyond all doubt, Martini, Dario G. \"Cristoforo Colombo tra ragione e fantasia.\" ECIG, 1987. pp. 12 and 513. Retrieved 2011-02-22. born at Genoa:\n\n Other information \nOther testimony of contemporary or succeeding authors include:\n\nA reference, dated 1492 by a court scribe Galindez, referred to Columbus as \"Cristóbal Colón, genovés.\"\nThe historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, was the earliest of Columbus's chroniclers and was in Barcelona when Columbus returned from his first voyage. In his letter of May 14, 1493, addressed to Giovanni Borromeo, he referred to Columbus as Ligurian, Liguria being the Region where Genoa is located.\nMichele da Cuneo from Savona, a friend of Columbus's (possibly from childhood), sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: \"In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral.\"\nGiambattista Strozzi, a Florentine merchant, reported in a letter sent from Cadiz on March 19, 1494: \"On the 7th of this month there arrived here in safety twelve caravels which came from the new islands found by Columbus Savonese, Admiral of the Ocean, for the king of Castile, having come in twenty-five days from the said islands of the Antilles.\"\nCesáreo Fernández Duro in his book Colón y la Historia postuma, mentions the chronicler Alonso Estanquez, who has composed a Crónica de los reyes don Fernando y doña Isabel, before 1506, where he writes: \"Cristobal Colón, genovés.\"\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. Below the island of Hispaniola, near the coast of Paria (Central America) he inserted the words: \"Iste insule per Columbum genuensem almirantem ex ma[n]dato regis Castelle invent[a]e sunt\" or \"these islands have been discovered by the Genoese admiral Columbus by order of the king of Castile.\"\nWitnesses in the 1511 and 1532 hearings in the Pleitos agreed that Columbus was from the Ligur. Another witness at the same hearing placed it more precisely, testifying, \"I heard it said that [he] was from the seigneury of Genoa, from the city of Savona.\" \nFather Antonio de Aspa, a Hieronymite from the convent of Mejorada, between 1512 and 1524, wrote a report on Columbus's first voyage, drawn largely from the Decades of Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, in which he claimed that Columbus was Genoese. \nThe Portuguese Jorge Reinel, in his map of 1519, writes the following words: \"Xpoforum cõlombum genuensem.\" \nThe German Simon Grynaeus, writes: \"Christophorus natione Italicus, patria Genuensis, gente Columba.\"\nD. Diego, a grandson of the admiral, was knight of the Order of Santiago, in the genealogy section, of 1535, says: \"Paternal Grandparents / Christopher Columbus, a native of Saona near Genoa, / and Filipa Moniz, a native of Libon.\" In the same year, Pedro de Arana, a cousin of Columbus's Spanish mistress, testified that he knew Columbus was from Genoa. \nThe Spaniard Alonzo de Santa Cruz, c. 1550, said Columbus was from Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Pedro Cieza de León writes that Columbus was originally from Savona.\nIn his Commentarius de Ophyra regione apud Divinam Scripturam Commemorata of 1561, the Portuguese geographer Gaspar Barreiros, reported that Columbus was \"Ligurian.\" \nThe Spaniard Jerónimo Zurita y Castro, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, man, as he said, whose company had always been for the sea and its predecessors, so that was foreign born and raised in poverty and the banks of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese António Galvão, writes: \"In the yeere 1492, in the time of Don Ferdinando king of Castile, he being at the siege of Granada, dispatched one Christopher Columbus a Genoway with three ships to goe and discouer Noua Spagna.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo de Illescas, writes: \"Christopher Columbus Genoese, was born at Nervi, a village near to Genoa.\"\nThe Spaniard Esteban de Garibay, humanist and historian, writes: \"A man of the Italian nation, named Christopher Columbus, native of Cugurco (Cogoleto), or Nervi, village of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese João Matalio Metelo Sequano in 1580, writes that Columbus was born in the city of Genoa. \nThe Frenchman Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière, writes: \"La plupart des princes chretiens, le nostre sur tous, l'Anglais, le Portugais, l'Espagnol mémes, n'avaient daigné préster sculement l'ouíe a l'ouverture que l'ltalien leur faisait.\"\nThe Spaniard Julián del Castillo, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, an Italian, was originally from Cogurio (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village near to the famous city of Genoa.\"\nThe German Michael Neander, writes: \"Christophoro Colombo Genuensi.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo Argote de Molina clearly identified Albissola Marina as Columbus's birthplace.\nFriar Juan de la Victoria, author of the 16th century, wrote a Catálogo de los Reyes godos de España extracted from Fernández Duro in his Colón y La Historia Postuma; says the friar: \"In the year 1488, the Italian Christopher Columbus, native of Cugureo (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village of Genoa, sailor.\"\nThe Spaniard Juan de Castellanos, poet and chronicler, writes that Columbus was born in Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Juan de Mariana, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, Genoese of nation.\"\nThe Portuguese Pedro de Mariz, historian and librarian, says that Columbus was Genoese.\n\n Historians \n\nScholars agree that Columbus was Genoese.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison, in his book Christopher Columbus: Admiral of the Ocean Sea, notes that many existing legal documents demonstrate the Genoese origin of Columbus, his father Domenico, and his brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo (Diego). These documents, written in Latin by notaries, were legally valid in Genoese courts. The documents, uncovered in the 19th century when Italian historians examined the Genoese archives, form part of the Raccolta Colombiana. On page 14, Morison writes:Besides these documents from which we may glean facts about Christopher's early life, there are others which identify the Discoverer as the son of Domenico the wool weaver, beyond the possibility of doubt. For instance, Domenico had a brother Antonio, like him a respectable member of the lower middle class in Genoa. Antonio had three sons: Matteo, Amigeto and Giovanni, who was generally known as Giannetto (the Genoese equivalent of \"Johnny\"). Giannetto, like Christopher, gave up a humdrum occupation to follow the sea. In 1496 the three brothers met in a notary's office at Genoa and agreed that Johnny should go to Spain and seek out his first cousin \"Don Cristoforo de Colombo, Admiral of the King of Spain,\" each contributing one third of the traveling expenses. This quest for a job was highly successful. The Admiral gave Johnny command of a caravel on the Third Voyage to America, and entrusted him with confidential matters as well.\n\nOn the topic of Columbus's being born somewhere besides Genoa, Morison states: Every contemporary Spaniard or Portuguese who wrote about Columbus and his discoveries calls him Genoese. Four contemporary Genoese chroniclers claim him as a compatriot. Every early map on which his nationality is recorded describes him as Genoese or Ligur, a citizen of the Ligurian Republic. Nobody in the Admiral's lifetime, or for three centuries after, had any doubt about his birthplace.\n\nPaolo Emilio Taviani, in his book Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea discusses \"the public and notarial acts – original copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona – regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\" In Columbus the Great Adventure he further claims that Columbus named the small island of Saona \"to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.\"\nThis is fully accepted by Consuelo Varela Bueno, \"Spain's leading authority on the texts, documents, and handwriting of Columbus.\" She devotes several pages to the question of Columbus native land, and concludes that \"all chroniclers of that period wrote that he was from Liguria in northern Italy.\" The evidence supporting the Genoese origin of Columbus is also discussed by Miles H. Davidson. In his book Columbus Then and Now: A Life Reexamined, he writes:Diego Méndez, one of his captains, in testimony given in the ''Pleitos'', he said that Columbus was \"Genoese, a native of Savona which is a town near Genoa.\" Those who reject this and the more than ample other contemporary evidence, given by both Italian and Spanish sources as well as by witnesses at these court hearings, are simply flying in the face of overwhelming evidence. [...] What is the reason behind so much futile speculation? It can be mostly attributed to parochialism. Each of the nations and cities mentioned wants to claim him for its own. Since no effort was made to locate the supporting data until the early nineteenth century, and since at that time not all of the archives had been adequately researched, there was, initially, justification for those early efforts to establish who he was and where he came from. To do so today is to fulfill Montaigne's maxim, \"No one is exempt from talking non-sense; the misfortune is to do it solemnly.\"\n\n Language \nThe spoken language of Genova and the Ligurian coast would primarily have been the Ligurian language. The Italian language was originally based on the fourteenth century vernacular of Florence in the adjacent region of Tuscany, and would not have been the main spoken language of Genova in the fifteenth century.\n\nAlthough Columbus wrote almost exclusively in Spanish, there is a small handwritten Genoese gloss in a 1498 Italian (from Venice) edition of Pliny's Natural History that he read after his second voyage to America: this shows Columbus was able to write in Genoese and read Italian. There is also a note in Italian in his own Book of Prophecies exhibiting, according to historian August Kling, \"characteristics of northern Italian humanism in its calligraphy, syntax, and spelling\". Phillips and Phillips point out that 500 years ago, the Romance languages had not distanced themselves to the degree they have today. Bartolomé de las Casas in his Historia de las Indias claimed that Columbus did not know Spanish well and that he was not born in Castile.\n\nValiant scholars have dedicated themselves to the subject of Christopher Columbus's language. They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other writings of his that have come down to the modern day. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. Christopher Columbus's language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Portuguese, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.\n\n Iberian origin \nCrypto-Judaism \nSalvador de Madariaga argued in 1940, that Columbus was a marrano forced to leave Spain for Genoa. Different scholars like Jose Erugo, Celso Garcia de la Riega, Otero Sanchez and Nicholas Dias Perez have since concluded that Columbus may have had a Jewish background. This hypothesis is founded on many observations about Columbus, for example: his reference to the expulsion of the Jews in his first accounts, the reference to the Second Temple of Jerusalem by the Hebraic term \"Second House\", the Hebrew letters bet-hei (meaning B'ezrat hashem) on all but one of his letters to his son, and an anagram that was a cryptic substitute for the Kaddish, according to Cecil Roth. \n\nSecondly, another evidence is reflected by the fact that all the personalities who supported Columbus before the kings are of Jewish origin and that his voyage was mainly funded by two Jewish conversos and a prominent Jew: Luis de Santángel, Gabriel Sanchez, and Don Isaac Abrabanel, respectively.\n\nPrior to 1892, the Church demanded from all dioceses all existing documentation on Christopher Columbus. Once all the documentation was received at the Vatican, the beatification process never began, according to proponents of Jewish theory because they realized that Columbus was Jewish.\n\nIn a 1973 book, Simon Wiesenthal postulated that Columbus was a Sephardi, careful to conceal his Judaism yet also eager to locate a place of refuge for his persecuted fellow countrymen. Wiesenthal argued that Columbus's concept of sailing west to reach the Indies was less the result of geographical theories than of his faith in certain Biblical texts—specifically the Book of Isaiah. He repeatedly cited two verses from that book: \"Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them,\" (60:9); and \"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth\" (65:17). Wiesenthal claimed that Columbus felt that his voyages had confirmed these prophecies. Jane Francis Amler shared those views in 1977. Estelle Irizarry echoed this as well, further noting that Columbus always wrote in Spanish, occasionally included Hebrew in his writing, and referenced the Jewish High Holidays in his journal during the first voyage.\n\nA document suggests that Columbus belonged to a Marrano family from Majorcan origin. However the authenticity of the document hasn't been proved. The novelist Robert Graves argued: \"his surname is still common in the island.\"\n\n Catalan \nSince the early 20th century, researchers have attempted to connect Columbus to the Catalan-speaking areas of Spain, usually based on linguistic evidence. The first to propose a birthplace under the Crown of Aragon was Peruvian historian Luis Ulloa in a  book originally published in 1927 in French. Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, University of Madrid historian of America, said that Ulloa's \"fiery imagination\" had placed abstruse interpretations on court documents to support his thesis, had found no positive proof, and had dismissed as false any evidence supporting a Genoese origin.\n\nThroughout Columbus's life, he referred to himself as Christobal Colom; his contemporaries and family also referred to him as such. It is possible that Colom is the shortened form of Columbus used for the Italian surname Colombo (which means \"dove\"). Colom can also be a Portuguese, French, or Catalan name, and in the latter means \"dove\". \nSome more recent studies also state Columbus had Catalan origins, based on his handwriting, though these have been disputed. Charles J. Merrill, a specialist in medieval Catalan literature at Mount St. Mary's University, claims Columbus's handwriting is typical of a native Catalan, and his mistakes in Castilian are \"most likely\" transfer errors from Catalan, with examples such as \"a todo arreo\" (a tot arreu), \"todo de un golpe\" (tot d'un cop), \"setcentas\" (set-centes), \"nombre\" (instead of número), \"al sol puesto\" (el sol post). Merrill states that the Genoese Cristoforo Colombo was a modest wool carder and cheese merchant with no maritime training and whose age does not match the one of Columbus. Merrill's book Colom of Catalonia was published in 2008.\n\n Portugal \n\nPatrocínio Ribeiro claimed that Columbus was Portuguese in 1916, and Moisés Bensabat Amzalak hypothesized on Columbus's signature with the Kabbalah. Based on those theories, José Mascarenhas Barreto argued in 1988, that Columbus was a Portuguese agent who hatched up an elaborate diversion to keep the Spanish from the lucrative trade routes, and suggested he was born in Cuba, Portugal, while his real name was supposedly Salvador Fernandes Zarco''. However, the genealogy presented has been disputed\n\nProponents of the Portuguese hypothesis also point to a court document which stated that Columbus's nationality was \"Portuguese\" and in another Columbus uses the words \"my homeland\" in relation to Portugal.\n\nOther theories \nOther theories claim that Columbus was a Byzantine Greek nobleman, a Sardinian nobleman, a Norwegian, a Scot, or that he was the son of King Władysław III of Varna. Many cities have been hypothesized as the birthplace of Columbus, notably Calvi in Corsica, which in Columbus's times was under Genoese rule. \n\nBritish historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto, writes in his book:The Catalan, French, Galician, Greek, Ibizan, Jewish, Majorcan, Scottish, and other Columbuses concocted by historical fantasists are agenda-driven creations, usually inspired by a desire to arrogate a supposed or confected hero to the cause of a particular nation or historic community – or, more often than not, to some immigrant group striving to establish a special place of esteem in the United States. The evidence of Columbus's origins in Genoa is overwhelming: almost no other figure of his class or designation has left so clear a paper trail in the archives.\n\nDNA study \nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins was begun in 2021, using the remains in Seville.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences \n\nColumbus family\nChristopher Columbus\nColumbus, Christopher\nColumbus, Christopher", "machine_text": " Origin Theories of Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) Christopher Columbus is the explorer credited for the European exploration of the Americas, the Caribbean, and other parts of the world. Columbus’s nationality and place of birth have been the subject of speculation for centuries. Four main theories have been advanced regarding his place of origin: 1) Cromagnolo, a low-Gallic dialect spoken in Northern Italy and Southern France; 2) Catalan, spoken in Northern Spain and parts of southern France; 3) Iberian, which is linguistically and culturally linked to Spanish and Portuguese; 4) Italian, the most widely accepted origin. The Cromagnolo theory is the oldest of the four. It was put forth in 1593 by the Italian historian and playwright Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés who argued that Columbus spoke a \"Gallic\" Italian language. He claimed that Colombus was actually Catalan, originally from Catalonia, a region in modern-day Spain. He went as far as referring to Colombus as a \"Catalano-Italian of divine origin\". The Iberian origin theory has been supported by Spanish historians who believe that Colombus was a Spanish-Portuguese adventurer, born in Seville, Andalusia, with the surname Colón. This theory is bolstered by the fact that the name 'Christopher' is believed to have been taken from the Hebrew, which would have been spoken in Seville. The Italian origin theory is the most widely accepted and it was backed by Columbus himself. He claimed to have been born in Genoa, and many believe that he was in fact a Genoese explorer and skilled sailor. While there is no birth certificate that has proven he was born in Genoa, some historians argue that he was raised there and that could explain why he cited Genoa as his origin. Ultimately, it may never be known who or what Christopher Columbus was and where he was born. The various theories presented here help us to gain insight into the man and the legacy he left behind. While his true origins may remain a mystery, what is known is that Christopher Columbus was an extraordinary explorer and a symbol of a different era in European history.

He was a minister in the government of Sir James Mitchell.\n\nEarly life\nLindsay was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Sarah (née Gillies) and William Lindsay. He arrived in Western Australia as a young man, having earlier spent two years in Queensland. During the Boer War, Lindsay served two tours of duty with a Western Australian regiment. He was refused permission to re-enlist after his first tour of duty, but supposedly stowed away on a troop ship and talked his way into continuing to serve. After the war's end, Lindsay did not return to Australia until 1905, when he took up land at Wyalkatchem as one of the region's first settlers. He was elected to the Dowerin Road Board in 1912, and then switched to the Wyalkatchem Road Board upon its creation in 1920.\n\nPolitics and later life\nLindsay entered parliament at the 1924 state election, winning the seat of Toodyay from the sitting Country member, Alfred Piesse. He and Piesse belonged to separate factions of the party, which had split in 1923 due to disputes over the coalition with the Nationalist Party. Lindsay was re-elected to Toodyay with an increased majority at the 1927 election. He switched to the new seat of Mount Marshall at the 1930 election, which saw a victory for the Nationalist–Country coalition, and was subsequently appointed to cabinet as Minister for Public Works and Minister for Labour.\n\nAt the 1933 state election, both Lindsay and the Mitchell government were defeated. He was one of four government ministers to lose their seats (along with Mitchell, John Scaddan, and Hubert Parker), although his defeat was to an \"Independent Country\" candidate, Frederick Warner. Lindsay stood for East Province at the 1936 Legislative Council election, but was defeated by Garnet Wood. He made one final run for parliament at the 1943 state election, but lost to Hugh Leslie. Lindsay retired to Perth, dying there in 1957, aged 81. He had married Annie Sherwood in 1911, with whom he had four children.\n\nSee also\n Second Mitchell Ministry\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1876 births\n1957 deaths\nAustralian Army soldiers\nAustralian military personnel of the Second Boer War\nMembers of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly\nNational Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia\nPoliticians from Glasgow\nScottish emigrants to Australia\nWestern Australian local councillors\n20th-century Australian politicians", "machine_text": " John Lindsay (born 11 February 1962) is a Western Australian politician, currently representing the Legislative Assembly seats of Clarkson and Burns Beach since 2008. Lindsay was born in the North West of Australia in the town of Karratha, in 1962. He worked as an apprentice mechanic before pursuing a career in Local Government. Later, Lindsay worked in the Resources industry in a managerial capacity. Lindsay joined the Liberal Party in 2001 and subsequently was elected Mayor of Mindarie Shire Council in 2003. He first entered the Legislative Assembly in 2008, when he defeated the incumbent Labor Member for Clarkson, Kay Hallahan in the 2008 State election by 42 votes. He was re-elected in the 2013 and 2017 State elections. During his time as a Member of the Legislative Assembly, Lindsay held positions such as Chairman of the Southern Metropolitan Regional Council, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of Community Development, Chairman of the Education Standing Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Mines and Petroleum Standing Committee. He was also the Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Training and Workforce Development for two years. In 2008, Lindsay was named as an ambassador for Stockland's \"Growth in Australia\" program. The program works to spread knowledge of the benefits of living and maintaining a home in Australia. In 2019, Lindsay held both the Clarkson and Burns Beach seat. He was re-elected to both these seats in the 2021 State Election. Lindsay has said that his political philosophy is to reduce cost of living outcomes through rational and pragmatic policies, such as capping public sector wages and reducing red tape. He also believes in diversifying the economy and expanding investment in tourism and the agricultural sector. Lindsay and his wife Karen have two adult children.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Candies Creek Ridge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Candies Creek Ridge, also known (more commonly in the past) as Clingan Ridge, is a geographic feature ridge located primarily in Bradley County, Tennessee, on the southeastern border of the state. It overlooks Candies Creek and is in north Cleveland, Tennessee. \n\nFound here in 1996 was a large South Appalachian Mississippian culture village, built about 1000-1200 CE. It is unusual in this location, because Mississippian villages were typically found in the bottomlands along rivers and creeks. The 5-acre site was acquired for preservation by The Archeological Conservancy in 2001 and is known as the Jim Sharp Archeological Preserve.\n\nGeography\nThe ridge, one of a series of parallel ridges that are a continuation of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, is one of the tallest, averaging approximately 997 feet (304 meters) of elevation. The highest point, in Cleveland, Tennessee, is 1,014 feet (309 meters). It is also known as Lebanon Ridge south of Cleveland. The ridge stretches from Tunnel Hill, Georgia to the lower Hiwassee River at the Bradley/McMinn County line in Tennessee. \n\nSeveral highways cross the formation, including (from south to north) GA SR 2, TN SR 317, APD-40, US 11/US 64, SR 312, Interstate 75 and SR 60 (together), Paul Huff Parkway, and SR 308.\n\nTo the west is a ridge usually referred to in Tennessee as Mount Zion Ridge, and in the valley between the ridges in Tennessee is Candies Creek. To the east is a ridge referred to in northern Bradley County as Mouse Creek Ridge, and in the valley between is South Mouse Creek. This ridge is called Lead Mine Ridge in the southern part of the Bradley County and in Georgia.\n\nHistory\nAs was the case throughout the river and creek valleys in the Southeast, this area for thousands of years was settled by indigenous cultures. In 1996 a team of archeologists were consulted to investigate possible Cherokee graves at a subdivision development site a few miles west of Candies Creek Ridge. They discovered a large South Appalachian Mississippian culture village, which has been dated to 1000-1200 CE. Architectural remains included a defensive palisade. Archeologists said it was unusual to find such a large Mississippian site in the uplands, as they were more typically developed in bottomlands along rivers. \n\nThe Archeological Conservancy bought the site from the developer, who offered it at less than market, recognizing its historic significance. (This transaction was approved by both the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the Cherokee Nation.) Additional work at the site has found a variety of artifacts, another Mississippian palisade, some human burials, and trade goods associated with the historic Cherokee. After surveying and mapping, the researchers left most of the features and artifacts undisturbed in the ground, to allow opportunity for future studies. The federally recognized Cherokee tribes arranged for reconsecrating the human burials. The site is now named the Jim Sharp Archeological Preserve, for the man who sold the property to the Conservancy.\n\nThe historic Cherokee referred to the creek in the valley west of the ridge in Bradley County as Little Kiuka Creek. Their village nearby overlooked the confluence of two creeks.\n\n19th century to present\nThe waterway was later named by European Americans as Candy's Creek (today is known as Candies Creek) for Henry Candy, who settled along the creek around 1817, after the Cherokee had ceded their land north of the Hiwassee River to the United States. \n\nThe Candy's Creek Cherokee Indian Mission Station, organized in 1824 by Samuel Worcester and five others, was built near their historic village by the creek. Today the intersection of SR 60 and Paul Huff Parkway are south of this former site. The station closed in 1838 after Cherokee Removal; it was notable as the first organized church and post office in Bradley County. The building also contained a school. \n\nA historical marker commemorating the mission station was installed near the historic site along SR 60 in 1959 near the present-day intersection of Paul Huff Parkway. It disappeared, reportedly around the time Paul Huff Parkway was constructed. Candy's Creek Cherokee Elementary, a new school in North Cleveland that opened here in August 2019, was named for the mission station.\n\nIn Bradley County, the ridge is named for the Clingan family, who lived on it in what is now northern Cleveland. A.A. Clingan, one of the family members, was Bradley County's first elected sheriff, serving from 1837 to 1838 and 1840 to 1846. The family of his wife, Martha Blythe, founded Blythe Ferry on the south side of the Tennessee River in Meigs County, Tennessee in 1809. The Clingan family cemetery, located on the western foot of the ridge off SR 60, was rediscovered in 2014 and restored in 2016.\n\nCounties \nGA\nCatoosa County\nWhitfield County\n\nTN\nBradley County\nHamilton County\n\nCities and communities\nCleveland, Tennessee\nMcDonald, Tennessee\nTunnel Hill, Georgia\n\nReferences \n\nRidges of Tennessee\nLandforms of Bradley County, Tennessee\nLandforms of Hamilton County, Tennessee\nLandforms of Catoosa County, Georgia\nLandforms of Whitfield County, Georgia\nSouth Appalachian Mississippian culture\nArchaeological sites in Tennessee\nCleveland, Tennessee\nRidges of Georgia (U.S. state)\nCleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee", "machine_text": " in it Candies Creek Ridge is a geological formation located in Bradley and Polk counties, in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It runs along a northwest-southeast axis through the center of the two counties, and is part of the greater Cumberland Plateau mountain system. The ridge reaches heights of up to 1,800 feet (550 m) above sea level and forms a watershed divide between the Little Tennessee River to the north and the Hiwassee River to the south. The ridge gained its name from a nearby Cherokee village, known as the Candies Town, which existed in the late 18th century. It was one of the largest settlements of the middle Cherokee towns, and predated the Trail of Tears in the early 19th century. It was named after 17th-century Indian trader Alexander Candie. Candies Creek Ridge has been studied extensively by geologists since the 19th century. Its sandstone cliffs, steep slopes, and scenic vistas have attracted hikers, photographers, and naturalists for generations. The ridge is a part of the Chickamauga-Hiwassee Corridor, established by Conservation Fisheries, Inc. in 1995, and it is a major stopover site for numerous species of migrating birds. The ridge is home to an extensive variety of plant and animal species. It is particularly notable for its numerous wetlands and beaver ponds, as well as its mature stands of red cedar, white oak, and oak-hickory. Its wetlands have attracted a variety of fish species, including bass and bream. Candies Creek Ridge is a vital source of clean water for its surrounding communities, with its numerous springs and seeps providing for a large proportion of the polk county's water supply. In addition, the ridge serves as a natural barrier which moderates the temperature range of the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee river watersheds, providing a valuable service Ecology in the area. The ridge remains largely untouched by man, due to its remote location, but there has been an increase in recreational and residential development on its margins in recent decades. This has raised environmental concerns, with some organisms potentially losing the habitat they need to survive in the area. Candies Creek Ridge is a valuable natural resource to Tennessee's landscape, ecology, and economy. It is an important part of the state's cultural heritage, as well as of its geological history. Though there are increasing threats posed by man due to development in the area, conservation efforts are in place to preserve the ridge for future generations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42649744}

Great Bend High School opened its doors in 1907 with a faculty of three teachers and an enrollment of 92 students. It was originally located on the first block of Main Street. During the 1950s, the explosive growth of Great Bend caused the high school to outgrow its facilities, so the district built a new, larger high school in 1956–58.

Janssen is a very common surname of Dutch origin. The meaning of the name can be translated as Little John.

The spelling Janssen is the most common form of the name, accounting for over 20 percent of the total occurrences of the variety of spellings used. The first recorded use of Janssen was in the Netherlands prior to 700 A.D. It was a patronymic surname, meaning that it was derived from the given name of a father or ancestor. From that time on, it has remained a popular surname in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark, as well as in other countries. The two most common spelling variations of the name are Jansen and Johnson. With the increase in immigrations to the United States after 1650, the name Johnson became more widely used in the country. The Johnson variation seen in the United States today is most likely derived from the Janssen spelling variant associated with European immigrants. Many people with the Janssen surname are now part of a global community. This includes prominent figures such as Johannes Janssen, the 19th‑century German historian, and Cor Janssen, the Dutch film director. Other well‑known individuals with the surname include the Dutch painters Dirck Dircksz Jansz (1562–1609) and Jan Adam Janssen (1615–1709), and the Dutch composer Joannes Antonius Janssen (1765–1837). The Janssen name lives on today. It is a popular choice for parents in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and beyond. It remains a strong connection to the long history of immigrants who have made their home in many countries around the world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vidyapati\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vidyapati ( – 1460), also known by the sobriquet Maithil Kavi Kokil (the poet cuckoo of Maithili), was a Maithili and Sanskrit poet-saint, composer, writer, courtier and royal priest. He was a devotee of Shiva, but also wrote love songs and devotional Vaishnava songs. He knew Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, and Maithili.\n\nVidyapati's influence was not just restricted to Maithili and Sanskrit literature but also extended to other Eastern Indian literary traditions.\nThe language at the time of Vidyapati, the prakrit-derived late Abahattha, had just begun to transition into early versions of the Eastern languages such as Maithili and Bhojpuri. Thus, Vidyapati's influence on making these languages has been described as \"analogous to that of Dante in Italy and Chaucer in England\". He has been called the \"Father of Bengali literature\".\n\nEarly life\nVidyapati was born to a Maithil Brahmin family in the village of Bisapī (now Bisfi) in the present-day Madhubani district of the Mithila region of northern Bihar, India. The name Vidyapati (\"master of knowledge\") is derived from two Sanskrit words, vidya (\"knowledge\") and pati (\"master\"). There is confusion as to his exact date of birth due to conflicting information from his own works and those of his patrons.  \n\nHe was the son of Gaṇapati Ṭhakkura, a Maithil Brahmin said to be a great devotee of Shiva. He was a priest in the court of Rāya Gaṇeśvara, the reigning chief of Tirhut. A number of his near ancestors were notable in their own right including his great-grandfather, Devāditya Ṭhakkura, who was a Minister of War and Peace in the court of Harisimhadeva.   \n\nVidyapati himself worked in the courts of various kings of the Oiniwar Dynasty of Mithila. Vidyapati's first commission was by Kīrttisiṃha, who ruled Mithila from around 1370 to 1380. This led to the Kīrttilatā, a long praise-poem for his patron in verse. This work contains an extended passage praising the courtesans of Delhi, foreshadowing his later virtuosity in composing love poetry. Though Kīrttisiṃha didn't commission any more works, Vidyapati secured a position at the court of his successor, Devasimha. The prose story collection Bhūparikramaṇa was written under Devasimha's auspices. Vidyapati developed a close friendship with Devasimha's heir apparent Sivasimha and started focusing on love songs. He wrote some five hundred love songs, primarily between 1380 and 1406. The songs he composed after that period were devotional praises of Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, and Ganga.\n\nThere was a close friendship between Sivasimha, king of Mithila from 1402 to 1406, and Vidyapati. As soon as Sivasimha ascended to his throne, he granted Vidyapati his home village of Bisapi, an act recorded on a copper plate. On the plate, Sivasimha calls him \"the new Jayadeva\". The poet also accompanied his king to Delhi, at the sultan's demand. A story about that encounter relates how the king was held by the sultan and Vidyapati negotiated for his release by displaying his clairvoyant powers. Sivasimha's favorable patronage and the courtly environment encouraged Vidyapati's experiments in love songs written in Maithili, a language everyone at court could enjoy. In 1406, Sivasimha went missing in a battle with a Muslim army. After this defeat, Vidyapati and the court took refuge at a king's court in Rajabanauli, Nepal. In 1418, Padmasimha succeeded Sivasimha as ruler of Mithila after an interregnum when Sivasimha's chief queen Lakhima Devi reigned for 12 years. Vidyapati returned to serve Padmasimha and continue writing, primarily treatises on law and devotional manuals.\n\nAt about 1430 or earlier, he is known to have returned to his village, Bisapi. He often visited its temple of Shiva.\n\nHe is recorded as having two wives, three sons and four daughters.\n\nPolitical career \nThe independence of the kings Vidyapati worked for was often threatened by incursions by Muslim sultans. The Kīrttilatā makes reference to an incident where the Oiniwar King, Raja Gaṇeśvara, was killed by the Turkish commander, Malik Arsalan in 1371. By 1401, Vidyapati requested the help of the Jaunpur Sultan in overthrowing Arsalan and installing Gaṇeśvara's sons, Vīrasiṃha and Kīrttisiṃha, on the throne. With the Sultan's assistance, Arsalan was deposed and Kīrttisiṃha, the oldest son, became the ruler of Mithila.\n\nThe conflicts of his time are evident in his works. In his early praise-poem Kīrttilatā, he slyly criticizes his patron for his perceived deference to Muslims.\n\nLove songs \nWhile working under his second patron, Devasimha, and especially under his successor Sivasimha, Vidyapati started composing Maithili songs of the love of Radha and Krishna. He seems to have only composed love songs between 1380 to 1406, though he kept writing until near his death in 1448. He seems to have ceased writing love songs after his patron and friend Sivasimha went missing in a battle and his court had to go into exile. These songs, which would eventually number five hundred, broke with convention. They were written in vernacular Maithili as songs, not as formal poems in literary Sanskrit as was done before. Until Vidyapati, Maithili wasn't employed as a literary medium.\n\nHe applied the tradition of Sanskrit love poetry to the \"simple, musical, and direct\" Maithili language. His inheritance from the Sanskrit tradition include its repertory of standard images to describe beauty (\"eyes large and tender like a doe's\") and standard settings to invoke certain moods and feelings (spring with its increasing heat as an analogy for rising passion). Vidyapati also drew from the beauty of his home in Madhubani (\"forest of honey\"), with its mango groves, rice fields, sugar cane, and lotus ponds.\n\nIn the tradition of Jayadeva's Gita Govinda, Vidyapati's songs were simultaneously praises of love-making and praises of Krishna; praise of Krishna involved praise of love-making. The intensity and poetic virtuosity of the songs were integral to these songs' function as a way to directly worship god and earn spiritual merit. Vidyapati's continuation of Jayadeva's program in a different language earned him the title \"the new Jayadeva\". His work did differ from his predecessor's in two ways. His songs were independent from one another unlike the Gita Govinda, which comprises twelve cantos telling an over-arching story of the couple's separation and reunion. While Jayadeva wrote from Krishna's perspective, Vidyapati preferred Radha's; \"her career as a young girl, her slowly awakening youth, her physical charm, her shyness, doubts and hesitations, her naive innocence, her need for love, her surrender to rapture, her utter anguish when neglected - all of these are described from a woman's point of view and with matchless tenderness.\"\n\nThese songs frequently mention the queens of king Sivasimha, an indicator that they were meant to be enjoyed by the court. At times, his poems identify Krishna with king Sivasimha and Radha with the king's chief queen, Lakhima Devi. They were sung by a court singer, Jayati, who sent the songs to music. They were learned by dancing girls and eventually spread out of the court.\n\nHis love songs have been collected into the Padāvalī, probably not by Vidyapati himself.\n\nDevotional songs \n\nThough he wrote hundreds of love songs about the romance of Radha and Krishna, he was not a special devotee of Krishna or Vishnu. Instead, he lavished attention on Shiva and Durga but also wrote songs about Vishnu and Ganga. He is particularly known for his songs of the love of Shiva and Parvati and prayers for Shiva as the supreme Brahman.\n\nA song titled All My Inhibition:All my inhibition left me in a flash,\nWhen he robbed me off my clothes,\nBut his body became my new dress.\nLike a bee hovering on a lotus leaf\nHe was there in my night, on me!\n\nInfluence\n\nOdia literature \nVidyapati's influence reached Odisha through Bengal. The earliest composition in Brajabuli,  an artificial literary language popularized by Vidyapati, is ascribed to Ramananda Raya, the governor of Godavari province of the King of Odisha, Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. He was a disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He recited his Brajabuli poems to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, when he first met him on the bank of river Godavari at Rajahmundry, southern provincial capital of Kingdom of Odisha in 1511–12. Other notable Odia poets influenced by Vidyapati's poems were Champati Ray and king Pratap Malla Dev (1504–32).\n\nBengali literature \nBengali Vaishnavas like Chitanya and Chandidas adopted Vidyapati's love songs about Radha and Krishna as Vaishnava hymns. All major Bengali poets of the medieval period were influenced by Vidyapati. As a result, an artificial literary language, known as Brajabuli was developed in the sixteenth century. Brajabuli is basically Maithili (as prevalent during the medieval period) but its forms are modified to look like Bengali. The medieval Bengali poets, Gobindadas Kabiraj, Jnandas, Balaramdas and Narottamdas composed their padas (poems) in this language. Rabindranath Tagore composed his Bhanusingha Thakurer Padabali (1884) in a mix of Western Hindi (Braj Bhasha) and archaic Bengali and named the language Brajabuli as an imitation of Vidyapati (he initially promoted these lyrics as those of a newly discovered poet, Bhanusingha). Other 19th-century figures in the Bengal Renaissance like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee have also written in Brajabuli.\n\nTagore was much influenced by Vidyapati. He set the poet's Bhara Badara to his own tune. A bridge in Kolkata near Sealdah Station is named after him (Vidyapati Setu).\n\nLegacy \nVidyapati has been kept alive in popular memory over the past six centuries; he is a household name in Mithila. His love songs are sung at weddings in the region. Many myths have arisen about him and people continue to sing his songs.\n\nBidāpat Nāch \nA form of folk dance-drama street theater, Bidāpat Nāch, where \"bidāpat\" is derived from \"Vidyapati\", is performed in Purnia district in north Bihar. While several groups performed in multiple villages in that area in the 20th century, there was just one group left in one village by 2012.\n\nIn mythology \nVidyapati's life has been mythologised in different ways. Many of his admirers ascribe miracles to him and detail his interaction with the gods. Among these stories is one which details that Shiva came down to earth to speak with Vidyapati after being impressed with his piety. This incarnation of Lord Shiva is known as Ugna. Ugna served as the servant of the poet Vidyapati.\n\nAnother story tells of story involving him and the Goddess Ganga. When his death was imminent, he decided to go to the river Ganga, but was too tired to continue just a few miles away. He resolves that if his piety was pure, the river would come to him. And so it happens. The goddess obliges and the river rises to let him take a final dip in holy waters. At some point in the past, the town where this is believed to have happened was renamed Vidyapati Nagar (\"town of Vidyapati\") and a Shiva temple was built there.\n\nIn popular culture \nPahari Sanyal played Vidyapati in the 1937 Bengali film Vidyapati, which received a lot of appreciation. The film starred Prithviraj Kapoor as King Shiva Singha of Mithila. Another film, also titled Vidyapati, was made in 1964 by Prahlad Sharma, starring Bharat Bhushan and Simi Garewal in the lead roles.\n\nIn Dec 2018, Darbhanga Airport was renamed Kavi Kokil Vidyapati Airport.\n\nWorks\n\nTexts\nMaṇimañjarīnāṭikā (Sanskrit, Tirahuta script) - a conventional romantic play (nāṭikā)\nBhūparikramaṇa (\"around the world\", Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a collection of eight prose stories set in different locales\n (Avahaṭṭha, Devanagari script) - a praise-biography in verse detailing the victory of Vidyapati's patron Kirttisimha's over his rival Malik Arsalan composed in the Sanskrit genre ākhyāyikā.\n (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a treatise on political ethics and ideal masculinity, composed broadly in the Sanskrit kathā genre.\nGorakṣavijaya (Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Maithili; Mithilākṣara script) - a musical play about Tantric saint Gorakṣanātha rescuing his teacher Matsyendranātha from a worldly life back to the life of a yogi\nKīrttipatākā (Avahaṭṭha, Tirahutā script) - a partially-extant praise-biography in verse for another of Vidyapati's patrons, Sivasimha.\nHarikeli (Avahaṭṭha, Tirahutā script) - a partially-extant allegorical love play between Krishna and the Gopis, with Raya Arjuna/Jagat Simha (a cousin of Sivasimha) as protagonist.\nLikhanāvalī (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a manual for scribes, with model letters, business documents, and affidavits\nŚaivasarvasvasāra (Sanskrit; one manuscript in Mithilākṣara script, two in Devanagari) - describes the significance and merits of worshipping Shiva, with proscribed rituals, citing extensively from the Puranas.\nGaṅgāvākyāvalī (Sanskrit) - a text glorifying the religious significance of Ganga, with citations from the Puranas.\n (Sanskrit, Tirahuta script) - a dharmaśāstra focusing on property law, with citations from many Smritis.\n (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a guide to types of ritual donations and their spiritual merits\n (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a guide to the proper worship of Durga, especially during Navaratri or in the month of Asvin.\nGayāpattalaka (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) - a text about funerary rituals.\n (Sanskrit) - a text describing the festivals that are to be observed through the year (probably the festivals that were observed in Mithila at that time).\nPadāvalī (Maithili, Tirahuta/Bangla/Devanagari scripts depending on version) - a compilation of Vidyapati's songs in praise of Krishna, likely not put together by him.\n\nTranslations \nHis works have been translated to several languages, including English.

He is known for his Vaishnava lyrics, which have been widely acclaimed in Indian literature. He was born in a humble peasant family in present-day Bihar, India, and was educated in Sanskrit. Vidyapati began writing at an early age, often in the form of verses composed for his beloved Lord Vishnu and for his companions. His verses were often singing praises upon Lord Vishnu, and frequently questioning the suffering of humanity under the materialistic world. He is best known for his padas, which are two-line verses, usually composed in the same meter. These typically consist of one stanza repeating itself four times, in which he asks a question, and the last stanza answering it. He was a highly influential poet and is still quoted often today by devotees of Lord Vishnu. Vidyapati's works have been translated into a number of languages, including Bengali and English. In addition to his lyrical poetry, he also composed a number of treatises on philosophy and ethics. He also wrote commentaries on Sanskrit scriptures such as the Upanishads, Gita and Vedas. Vidyapati was a major influence in the development of early Maithili culture and language. The rich cultural heritage of Mithila is largely credited to him. He is widely regarded as the Adi Kavi, a title meaning the ‘first poet’, of the Maithili language. Vidyapati's writings had a profound impact on the development of early Maithili literature, and his influence can be found in both the past and the present. His work continues to be studied and quoted by both scholars and devotees.

Elizabeth Sage Hare also collaborated with Taylor and Penrose on the center, the nation's first combined art museum, art school and performing arts venue.\n\nThe fine arts center was designed by New Mexico architect John Gaw Meem in a revolutionary design combining modernism and indigenous Pueblo style architecture Pueblo Revival Style and Spanish Colonial into \"Santa Fe Style\" architecture. In 1940, Meem's most modern design earned a Silver Medal at the Fifth Quadrennial Pan American Congress of Architecture.  The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAt the original Grand Opening in April 1936, Martha Graham performed Lamentation-Dance of Sorrow; \"art icon Alexander Calder executed the stage design for a sung dialog, \"Socrate,\" by Eric Satie; an operetta by Manuel de Falla performed by life-size marionettes; and Frank Lloyd Wright lectured on the new building.\"  \"The Transplanting of Culture,\" Archie Musick, American Art Magazine, 1937\n\nAbout the Fine Arts Center/Colorado College Alliance. On Aug. 24, 2016, the boards of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and Colorado College approved an alliance between both institutions. Following outreach that included listening sessions and a web-based comment process, the Strategic Planning Committee charged subcommittees to continue reaching out to identify strategic themes, goals, and initiatives to develop as the center and the college integrate their programs. Each subcommittee held community listening and small-group sessions to seek input. In all, the five committees held 40 meetings; and more than 800 comments were gathered. The Strategic Planning Committee used the reports to produce one overall plan. Following another round of community feedback, the Oversight Committee adopted the plan on June 14, 2017. On July 1, 2017, the center become the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College. A four-year transition period focuses on the museum 2017, Bemis Art School in 2018 and the performing arts in 2019.\n\nDescription\nThe Fine Arts Center is a modern poured concrete Pueblo-inspired structure that integrates Southwestern, Art Deco and Classic architectural elements. It has one, two and, for the theatre fly tower, four stories. Within the building are galleries, art studios, performing art facilities including a 450-seat theater, a library, music room, museum shop and storage and office space. The murals on the exterior of the building were produced by Boardman Robinson and Frank Mechau.  The auditorium includes three aluminum relief panels over the doors depicting Pueblo and Hopi Indian Kachina masks, all by noted Denver sculptor, Arnold Rönnebeck, murals in the original theater lounge (now restaurant) by Andrew Dasburg, Kenneth Adams, and Ward Lockwood, and a downstairs lounge mural by Archie Musick. \n\nFor the National Register of Historic Places, it was described as follows:\n\nIts monolithic pueblo massing, its undisguised modern use of concrete, aluminum and glass; its southwestern details, its Native American designs abstracted into Art Deco ornamentation; its streamlined elegance; and its classical proportions - all result in a timeless character - with fundamental roots to the region and the time as well as manifesting an innovative architectural reflectionof the building's underlying function, which is to preserve culture and to honor the contemporary.\n\nIt borders Monument Valley Park and has a view of Pikes Peak. It is near the city's business district, in a combined residential and office building zone, in the Colorado College campus. Its well-preserved state, reflects the initial building construction with maintenance and restoration.\n\nArts center\nThe multi-purpose center includes:\n Taylor Museum - Several galleries, where the permanent collection of Southwest art is displayed, in addition to other permanent works and traveling shows.\n The Performing Arts department's SaGāJi Theatre, the Fine Arts Center Theatre Company, produces comedies, dramas and musicals.

Scott RC Levy serves as the Producing Artistic Director and Director of Performing Arts and Nathan Halvorson is the Associate Director of Performing Arts.\n\nMany groups in the community used the stage at the FAC. The original Drama League (organized in 1916) used the theatre for all its performances. In 1946 the name was changed to Civic Players and in 1970 to the Civic Theatre. Further name changes occurred in 1988 when the resident group was rechristened the Repertory Theatre Company (under Thomas McElroy); in 2003 it was shortened to The REP (under Sandra Womochil Bray), and in 2007 it was renamed the \"Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center Theatre Company\" (under Alan Osburn). It's now a professional TCG Member Theatre (the national organization of the American Theatre) operating in both the SaGāJi Theatre and the 108-seat Music Room, hiring Equity and non-Equity performers, directors, designers, musicians and technicians from Colorado Springs and throughout the country (under current Producing Artistic Director Scott RC Levy).

Garcia (October 20, 1937 – October 15, 2013) was a Filipino lawyer and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was appointed to the Court on October 6, 2004, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and retired on October 19, 2007.\n\nEarly life and career \n\nThe youngest of four children and the only son of Juan Garcia and Benedicta Castillo, both illiterates, Cancio or Cancy to his friends, was born on October 20, 1937, in the remote barrio of Concordia at Alitagtag, Batangas.  Starting his education at the P. Gomez Elementary School (Manila), and thereafter at the Arellano (Public) High School (Manila), he qualified for admission into the College of Law of the University of the Philippines.  A product of the public school system, he graduated at the UP in 1961.  He obtained a post-graduate degree in Public Administration as a government scholar from the University of Santo Tomas in 1967.\n\nHoning his skills in the legal profession by serving as the assistant at the Macapagal Alafriz & Mutuc Law Offices, he went on to serve the government, first as Legal Office, then as Junior Presidential Staff Assistant in the Legal Office of Malacanang, and thereafter, as Solicitor in the Office of the Solicitor General, at that time headed by his former college professor, Solicitor General Estelito Mendoza.  Ripe for the judiciary after more than a decade of constant brushes with the law, he first sat at the bench as City Judge of Caloocan.  Serving for more than a decade in that capacity, and having won a Judge of the Year award, he rose to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Angeles City and later to the RTC in Caloocan.  Soon, then President Corazon Aquino took him back to Malacanang as Assistant Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs.  Aware that he is a Jurist at heart, President Cory appointed him to the Court of Appeals where he served for almost fourteen years until 2004, first as Associate Justice, then as Presiding Justice of that court, a position he held twice – from March 14 to July 29, 2001, and April 11, 2002, to April 8, 2003.  In October 2004, Justice Garcia reached the peak when President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appointed him as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, the Court's 156th Justice.\n\nCareer highlights \n Legal Assistant: 1961 to 1962\n Junior Presidential Staff Assistant: 2/1962 to 6/30/1972\n Solicitor: 7/1/1972 to 2/16/1974\n City Judge for Caloocan: 2/17/1974 to 1/17/1983\n RTC Judge, Angeles City: 1/18/1983 to 11/4/1986\n RTC Judge, Caloocan: 11/5/1986 to 3/8/1988\n Assistant Executive Secretary: 3/9/1998 to 12/16/1990\n Court of Appeals Justice: 12/17/1990 to 10/14/2004\n Supreme Court Justice: 10/15/2004 to 10/20/2007\n\nAwards \n 1976 Most Outstanding Judge, IBP CAMANAVA Chapter, January 29, 1977\n Outstanding Judge, Media Writers Association of the Philippines, October 12, 1985\n Certificate of Appreciation, Angeles City Metropolitan District Command, 1985\n Plaque of Appreciation for Judicious and Expeditious Implementation of the Dangerous Drugs Law, Philippine Constabulary Narcotics Command, February 1, 1986\n Certificate of Merit for Distinguished and Meritorious Service as Presiding Judge, Angeles City Lawyers’ League, January 5, 1989\n Plaque of Recognition as one of the Ten Outstanding Citizens of Alitagtag, Club Alitagtag, Batangas, May 5, 1989\n Plaque of Recognition for his promotion to the Court of Appeals, IBP CAMANAVA Chapter, November 15, 1991\n Certificate of Attendance for participation in the XVth Law Asia Biennial Conference, Law Association for Asia and the Pacific, August 1997\n Certificate of Attendance, Harvard Law School, June 2000\n Plaque of Recognition as Intellectual Giant, True Nationalist and Advocate of the Rights and Welfare of the Marginalized Sectors of Philippine Society, Kapatirang Plebeian Foundation, June 24, 2001\n Certificate of Appreciation, Supreme Court, Centenary Celebrations, July 11, 2001\n Outstanding Jurist Award, Consumers’ Union of the Philippines, 13th Annual National Consumers Award, May 31, 2002\n Ulirang Ama Sectoral Awardee for Law and the Judiciary, National Mother's Day and Father's Day Foundation of the Philippines, June 16, 2002\n Caloocan's Best for Law and Judiciary, Caloocan 41st Foundation Day, February 16, 2003\n Plaque of Merit for Raising the Level of Competence and Integrity in the Dispensation of Justice and Unselfish and Dedicated Service to the Judiciary, Philippine Trial Lawyers Association, Inc., May 9, 2003\n Parangal ng Bayan Award in Law and Judiciary, 18th Annual Parangal ng Bayan Awards, May 24, 2003\n Citation of Distinction, Philippine Judges Association, October 23, 2003\n Plaque of Appreciation as Most Outstanding Plebeian in Government Services for Judiciary, Kapatirang Plebeian Foundation, Inc.

It ran from 2000 to 2005. Its concept was developed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe prior to the television series. Alongside the television series, the show had a run in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre between 17 April and 12 May 2001 from which a ‘Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned - Live in the West End’ DVD was released.\n\nFormat\n\nThe intro to the show begins with a slow pan along an empty street before focussing on actor Lewis Rose who sings the intro before the crowds come in to join with a chant of \"It'll never work\" and head into the theatre to watch the show. Baddiel and Skinner eventually join in with the crowds and enter themselves, singing \"And neither will we again!\"\n\nThe show features the two hosts sitting on a couch on-stage and responding to questions from the audience – at times rather seriously, but usually with bizarre digressions into satirical comedy. An audience member is chosen as \"Secretary\" and has the job of keeping a note of the topics covered on a white board. In practice, the personality of the secretary will also prompt many jokes – usually at his or her expense. At the end of the show, Skinner asks either the secretary or the audience to choose between two song books, and to pick a page number between 1 and 20. This process determines which song is performed by the duo, sung by Skinner with Baddiel accompanying him on piano (or, on at least one occasion, semi-acoustic guitar).\n\nTopics of discussion are wholly mandated by the audience and have ranged from discussions of the war against Iraq and other political events to comments on the latest plot twists of popular soap operas and the Atkins diet. Skinner's Catholicism and Baddiel's Jewish culture are also occasional targets of humour (Baddiel describing Skinner's faith as being \"insane\" and Skinner often using a music-hall Jewish accent to hold mock dialogues among members of Baddiel's extended family, as well as both performers demonstrating how to \"play the piano in a convincingly Jewish manner\").\n\nTo avoid it becoming too similar to the pair's other show, Fantasy Football League, an unofficial rule was introduced to prevent discussion of football-related topics.\n\nSeries overview\n\nEpisodes\n\nOther versions\n\nIn 2004, a similar series, with Australian comedy duo Merrick & Rosso, aired in Australia - Merrick and Rosso Unplanned.\n\nOther 'unplanned' content\nBaddiel & Skinner produced a series of podcasts covering the 2006 FIFA World Cup for Avalon Television and The Times.\n\nA special edition for Comic Relief called Baddiel & Skinner unplanned & unpaid was done in front of a celebrity audience in 2001.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n .\n Off the telly Extended review of series one.\n\n2000s British television talk shows\n2000s British comedy television series\n2000 British television series debuts\n2005 British television series endings\nITV comedy\nTelevision series by ITV Studios\nEnglish-language television shows", "machine_text": " Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned was a British comedy sketch show, which was broadcast on BBC Two from 2000 to 2001 and hosted by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner. It was the duo’s second major television series, following on from their successful Fantasy Football League programme. The show was produced by John Lloyd, who was also responsible for some of the best-known comedy series of the late 1980s and 1990s such as Blackadder, Spitting Image and QI. Lloyd’s format incorporated a mixture of stand-up comedy, sketches and non-scripted introductory links and interviews. Unlike Baddiel and Skinner’s previous series, Fantasy Football League, the majority of Unplanned’s sketches were unscripted and improvised on the spot. This was an attempt to tap into the surrealist comedy of British shows such as The Goon Show and Monty Python's Flying Circus. The sketches generally revolved around the two hosts in various everyday situations, such as visiting an off-license, dealing with a difficult customer in a bank, or being interrogated by the police. Celebrity guests would also appear, including Johnny Vegas and Ricky Gervais, who hosted the final episode of the series in 2001. In addition to the improvised sketches, each episode also featured comic songs performed by Baddiel and Skinner, often making light of current affairs such as the Scottish independence referendum. The show ran for two series featuring a total of sixteen episodes, and was generally warmly received by critics over its two-year run. Although Unplanned is not as widely remembered as Baddiel and Skinner’s other collaborations, it continues to be a respected comedy series among fans of British comedy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 826595}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ali Sardar Jafri\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ali Sardar Jafri (29 November 1913 – 1 August 2000) was an Indian writer of Urdu language. He was also a poet, critic and film lyricist.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education\nAli Sardar Jafri was born in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh, where he spent his formative years.\n\nHis early influences were Mir Anees and Josh Malihabadi. In 1933, he was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) where he soon got exposed to Communist ideology and in 1936 he was expelled from the University for 'political reasons'. However, he graduated in 1938 from Zakir Husain College (Delhi College), Delhi University, but his subsequent postgraduate studies at Lucknow University ended prematurely following his arrest during 1940–41 for writing anti-War poems, and for taking part in political activities organised by the Indian National Congress as Secretary of the university's Students' Union.\n\nLiterary career\nJafri embarked on his literary career in 1938 with the publication of his first collection of short stories called Manzil (Destination). His first collection of poems  Parvaz (Flight) was published in 1944. In 1936, he presided over the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Movement in Lucknow. He also presided over their subsequent assemblies for the rest of his life.<ref> Frontline, Volume 17 – Issue 17, 19 August – 1 September 2000.</ref> In 1939, he became co-editor of Naya Adab, a literary journal devoted to the Progressive Writers' Movement which continued to be published until 1949.\n\nHe was involved in several social, political and literary movements. On 20 January 1949, he was arrested at Bhiwandi, for organising a (then banned) Progressive Urdu writers' conference, despite warnings from Morarji Desai, the Chief Minister of Bombay State; three months later, he was rearrested.\n\nHis important works as a lyricist include Dharti Ke Lal (1946) and Pardesi (1957) . Between 1948 and 1978 he published eight poetry collections, which include, Nai Duniya Ko Salaam (Salute to the New World), (1948), Khoon Ki Lakeer, Amn Ka Sitara, Asia Jaag Utha (Asia Awakes) (1951), Patthar Ki Deewar (Stone Wall) (1953), Ek Khwab Aur (One More Dream), Pairahan-i-Sharar (The Robe of Sparks) (1965) and Lahu Pukarta Hai (The Blood Calls) (1965). These were followed by Awadh ki khak-i-haseen (Beautiful Land of Awadh), Subhe Farda (Tomorrow Morning), Mera Safar (My journey) and his last anthology entitled  Sarhad, which the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee carried with him on his bus journey to Lahore in 1999. The prime minister had invited Jafri to accompany him on this trip but ill health prevented him from doing so. Sarhad is also an audio album dedicated to Indo-Pakistan amity produced by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal and composed and sung by \"Bulbul-e-Kashmir\" Seema Anil Sehgal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made history when he presented Sarhad, as a national gift, to the then prime minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, during the historic Lahore Summit, 20–21 February 1999. It was also a milestone in Jafri's life.\n\nIn the course of his literary career spanning five decades, Jafri also edited anthologies of Kabir, Mir, Ghalib and Meera Bai with his own introductions. He also wrote two plays for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), produced a documentary film Kabir, Iqbal and Freedom and two television serials: the runaway success, the 18-part Kahkashan, based on the lives and works of six Urdu poets of the 20th century he had known personally viz.Firaq Gorakhpuri, Josh Malihabadi, Majaz, Hasrat Mohani, Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Jigar Moradabadi; and Mehfil-e-yaaran  in which he interviewed people from different walks of life. Both serials had tremendous mass appeal. In addition, he published his autobiography. He was also the editor and publisher of Guftagu, one of the leading Urdu literary magazines of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nHe died on 1 August 2000 in Mumbai. To mark his first death anniversary, the book Ali Sardar Jafri: The Youthful Boatman of Joy'', edited by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal,  a close associate, was published in 2001.\n\nExcerpts from poems\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 1998, Jafri became the third Urdu poet to receive the Jnanpith Award (for 1997), after Firaq Gorakhpuri (1969) and Qurratulain Hyder (1989). The Bharatiya Jnanpith said, \"Jafri represents those who are fighting against injustice and oppression in society\". He was also the recipient of several other significant awards and honours including Padma Shri (1967), Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship (1971), the Gold medal from the Pakistan Government for Iqbal studies (1978), the Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy Award for poetry, the Makhdoom Award, the Faiz Ahmad Faiz Award, the Iqbal Samman Award from the Madhya Pradesh government and the Sant Dyaneshwar Award from the Maharashtra government.\n\nAligarh Muslim University (AMU) conferred a doctorate (D.Litt.) on him in 1986, fifty years after he was expelled from the university.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shekinah Jacob\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shekinah Jacob (Chennai) is an Indian playwright based in Bangalore.\n\nEarly life\nAs she stated in her interview (http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/her-plays-go-places/article5092888.ece) in The Hindu dated 14 September 2013,  playwriting came naturally to her at a very young age. Her first tryst with writing was in school when she won a national short story writing competition. In her high school in Vellore, Ida Scudder School, she wrote a musical for the annual play production, finding it easier to write one than to find an appropriate play in the library as her principal had initially suggested.\n\nShe graduated from Women's Christian College, Chennai. It was here that she began to explore this gift further…being an all women's college, they had no male actors and so she wrote a play titled Seven for a Secret that had an all-women cast. It went on to win the Best Script prize and the Best Audience Response at an inter-collegiate theatre festival.\n\nShe worked as a reporter in Bangalore doing food and play reviews. She then did an MA in English Literature at the University of Madras. She worked as a copywriter and then as a technical writer.\n\nLife as a playwright\n\nWhen she scribbled her first script on the back of a notebook in school, it was simply her idea of what she thought a play should look like. Yet, she says, the form came naturally. \nShe wrote her second full length script while studying at Women's Christian College. But she learnt the fundamentals of playwriting during a workshop by Mahesh Dattani and was later trained by the Royal Court Theatre in London.She says about her experience in her interview with 'The Hindu' \"I learnt how drama is action. Cause and effect. Your left brain and right brain have to work together.”\n \nIn WCC she had to write a play with no male actors in it. So she wrote a play with 7 girls in it titled \"Seven for a Secret \"and it was this play that got her into a workshop with the Royal Court Theatre, London. The play was performed in Chennai and it won the Best Script prize and Best Audience Response prize.\nShe participated in a playwriting workshop by Mahesh Dattani and the play she wrote at the end of this titled 'Only Women' had a rehearsed reading at the British Council.\n\nShe also wrote a monologue titled 'We are Water' that was aired on BBC radio in Sept 2003.\n\nAfter taking up various other jobs, she realised that her passion was in theatre, especially writing scripts.\nSo she approached the Royal Court Theatre again. This time she sent them a play that she had been working on. It was the original draft of 'The Long Way Home'. 'The Long Way Home', found its way to the country's most prestigious stages, from NCPA and Prithvi in Mumbai to the Museum Theatre in Chennai, last year. She had become a mother by then, and so she explored the dynamics between a mother and daughter.\" The play evolved as she realised her strength was dialogue.\n\nThe play 'The Long Way Home' was produced and staged by Evam entertainment and directed by Karthik Kumar. It starred the talented dancer-actor Anita Ratnam. The role was so authentic that every performance ended with people walking up to her and saying, \"You're just like my mom\".\nThe play was shown in Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Shekinah says, \"I realized that even if I'm writing about the small world I know, a domineering south Indian mother isn't too different from a mother at the other end of the world. As playwrights we have to fall in love with creating believable characters.\"\n\nHer biggest and most acclaimed work till date has been the hugely successful \"Ali J\".\n\nAli J began with a real story. Her brother is a lawyer who works with a human rights organisation in Mumbai. He told her about a young man who was imprisoned because drugs were planted in his bag. The man spent 10 years in a Mauritius prison, and then was moved to Mumbai. He's still in prison.\nAround the same time, evam asked her to write them a monologue for 'The Fringe'. \"They originally wanted one on Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and realizing how little Indian history she knew, she began to read extensively on the subject.\" After six months of reading, she decided to morph the two subjects. \"The actual writing took just as long as it took her to type.”\n\nAli J, produced by evam entertainment premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews and a four star review from The Scotsman. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nThe story works on two levels. It's about a guy in his 30s imprisoned in a cell in Chennai who is on death row for a crime he did not commit. It's about how circumstances and people shape his vision. She adds, \"The point is to capture the idea that a single event can change the course of your life. All of us are acted on by so many influences – childhood, love, jealousy…. Great historical figures were no different. Their decisions are so influenced by personal egos, ambitions, and little distractions.\n\nAli J by evam premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nTalking about her inspiration in her interview with \"The Indian Express\" on 25 October 2013 Jacob says, \"I read as widely as possible– my favorite playwrights include Alan Bennet for the brilliant way in which he captures miniature shifts of mood and the textured dynamics of relationships, also Tom Stoppard and David Mamet. And of course the immortal Shakespeare,\" she says. According to Jacob, good theatre is like a good democracy, 'by the people, of the people, and for the people'. She writes what she would like to watch as an audience. She enjoys watching plays that are rooted in her world. Theatre should be like an ongoing dialogue between the audience and the actors.\n\nShekinah Jacob began her own theatre group called Open House Productions, mainly to combine her two loves- entertaining, thought-provoking theatre that also generates income for charitable causes. The uniqueness of this theatre company is that operates on a Robin Hood model, funded by corporates and well-wishers, while most of the revenue from ticket sales go to deserving local NGOs in every locality that they perform in.\n\nOpen House Productions feel that artists should be rewarded for their time and talent and they try to pay every performer as generously as possible. \nIn an interview in 2015, playwright Naren Weiss told India-West that his play Censored came to him after Jacob's Ali J had been banned in multiple cities across India. The play was later shot as a sketch by the Stray Factory and went viral in India.\n\nTwo years ago Shekinah Jacob won the Charles Wallace Scholarship and acquired a Masters in Writing for Performance with a Distinction at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her course and exposure to cutting-edge theatre on London's stages was a huge learning experience and she has brought all of that back to the second innings of Open House Theatre Productions that was on a brief break during her years in the U.K. They are now back with The Christmas Shootout, a comedy for the festive season, beginning a national tour in December 2016 in all the four metros. They are also going international this year with an eighth show in Dubai, to reach a total audience of over 5500 people.\n\nPlay Ali J\nPart Bollywood romance, part social commentary on the after-effects of the partitioning of India, this perfectly pitched play by Shekinah Jacob, produced by Evam Theatre, never lets the weighty issues it tackles overshadow a heartfelt personal story. The writing is rich with humour and humanity, and TK Karthik's engaging performance brings Ali's warm and welcoming character to life.\n\nThe Scotsman  – \"Hot show pick...\" 4 stars\n\nThe play is both heartfelt and cerebral as it paints a picture of an India still living in the wake of brutal partition following independence, simultaneously telling the story of one man and millions of people. The writing is never simplistic but always open, and uttered with a joy of life that can only come to those facing death. Sublime.\n\nThree Weeks -\"Heartfelt and Cerebral\" – 5 stars\n\nNo Borders – \"Beautifully written script ... Excellent performance\" – 4 stars\n\nThe Stage – \"Impressive demanding performance\"\n\nFringe Review -\"Highly recommended show\"\n\nThe National, Fest – 'It's a powerful, often surprisingly humorous production, astutely illustrating the emotional shifts such a character can undergo, from naive hope to radical intensity.

Since 2010, she can not participate in any official exhibitions in Uzbekistan.\n\nWork\nAs a photographer she has participated in exhibitions addressing urban and rural issues and has collaborated on film and book projects including the presentation of the short film The Burden of Virginity.

In the course of her work she has documented the traditions, disparate cultures and everyday events in the modern borders of Uzbekistan.\n\nUmida Akhmedova is one of the most prominent representatives of the Uzbek photography.\n\nArrest and criminal charges\nOn November 17, 2009 she was summoned by Nodir Akhmadzhan, investigator of the Tashkent city police department and accused of defamation and of \"insult and slander of the Uzbek nation.\" These charges against her and others are due in part to participation on a project sponsored by the Swiss Embassy Gender Program. One of the works, Women and men: from dawn till dusk documents aspects of life in rural Uzbekistan. On December 16, 2009, criminal charges were filed against her due to her involvement in the aforementioned project as well as other gender and human rights media projects including The Burden of Virginity, about difficulties faced by women in Uzbekistan. The criminal charges carry a possible sentence of prison for up to six months, or 2–3 years of forced labor and she is currently banned from leaving the country.\n\nIn January 2010 she was accused of slander, allegedly \"insulting the Uzbek people\" after she produced her book portraying rural Uzbekistan and Uzbek traditions. She was charged on January 13, after an expert panel of 'specialists in the fields of religious affairs, spirituality, and psychology' found that her images portrayed Uzbekistan in a negative light to Western audiences: \"a foreigner who has never been to Uzbekistan, but who is familiar with this album, would reach the conclusion that [Uzbekistan] is a country where people live in the Middle Ages\"\n\nIn February 2010 she was found guilty of slandering and insulting the Uzbek people, but could walk away free.

She said she intended to appeal the conviction.\n\n\"Portsmouth University Pugwash\" columnist Mark Norman commented that, \"Umida Akhmedova is an Uzbek photographer who, in 2007, produced an album of images of the everyday lives of the people of Uzbekistan. The album, titled “Men and Women: Dawn to Dusk”, contains more than 100 images of Uzbek traditions and customs. The images, which are of simple and everyday scenes, have been severely lambasted by the Uzbek authorities, who have claimed the images portray the people of Uzbekistan as “backward”.

He studied law at Punjab University in Chandigarh, graduating in 1961. He practiced lawyer and appeared before the Supreme Court in India. He was a part of the legal team in the Salman Rushdie case, filed by the Indian Government in the late 1980s. In the proceedings, Shourie argued that the Indian Government had acted illegally in attempting to ban the publication of the book, The Satanic Verses, and did not have the power to interfere in the affairs of publishers. His arguments are said to have influenced the Court in its decision to grant freedom of speech in the case instead of favoring censorship. Over the years, Shourie has taken part in a wide range of human rights and censorship cases, including defending the rights of the writer Taslima Nasreen in India to be able to express her views without fear. In 2005, he was part of a legal team opposing a law proposed in Delhi that would have stopped people from showing cartoons and other forms of entertainment to children outside of cinemas. The proposed law would have heavily affected street performers and storytellers. Shourie argued against this bill and the High Court in Delhi eventually decided in favor of free speech. Shourie has been an outspoken opponent of censorship and an advocate of free speech throughout his career. He has lectured extensively on the subject matter and written several books defending free speech. In 1998, he wrote a book titled Freedom First: A Critique of Fundamentalism which argued that India should be open to all forms of expression and criticism. In his recent book, Fundamentals Not Freedoms: Are We Degrading Our Political Culture, Shourie critiques a lack of intellectual freedoms in India and draws attention to the importance of having a vibrant and open democracy. Shourie has been a powerful voice in the fields of human rights and freedom of speech in India and continues to be an important figure in these causes.

Kagayanen is an Austronesian language, belonging to the Visayan language family. It is related to other Visayan languages such as Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray and Masbatenyo. The language is known for its complex grammar, its different verb forms and its use of the particle or prefix “ma-” to modify nouns. Kagayanen has three main dialects: Visayan Kagayanen, which is predominantly spoken in Northern Samar; Eastern Samar Kagayanen, which is mainly spoken in Eastern Samar; and Samar Island Kagayanen consisting of both Visayan and Eastern Samar dialects. The language also has several closely related varieties spoken in the nearby islands of Biliran and Samar. Kagayanen is written using the Latin script, but is distinct from Filipino or Tagalog. There is also a substantial amount of loanwords from neighboring Philippine languages, as well as from Spanish, American English and Chinese. Kagayanen is used as a medium of instruction in some Kagayanen schools, as well as in some cultural traditions, folk tales and songs. It is also frequently used in the media, particularly in local television programs in Northern Samar. The Kagayanen language is not officially recognized by the Philippine government and does not have official status in any Philippine province or region. Despite this, it is accepted as an important marker of Kagayanen identity and as part of the region’s rich cultural heritage. Kagayanen continues to be spoken by over 143,000 people as of 2020. It has been used as part of an effort to promote regional unity, regional identity, regional dialects and regional culture, as part of the regional identity movement in the Visayas. In 2019, the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (KWF) announced its support for the revitalization of the Kagayanen language and appointed a Kagayanen linguistics expert to its Advisory Council on Language. The commission also provided assistance to Kagayanen language speakers and practitioners and worked on developing a language maintenance and development plan for the language.

It was the primary operating base for Italian airline Air Italy whose headquarters were located at the airport.

The airfield and seaplane base were targeted by Allied bombing in World War II, and the Germans opened another airfield 4.5 miles west of the town, which was renamed Olbia in 1945.\n\nCommercial flights gradually returned and in 1963, the Olbia-based airline Alisarda was formed. It successfully expanded its route network, introducing jet flights in 1972, and it was renamed Meridiana in 1991. However, the introduction of jet aircraft necessitated the building of a larger airport nearer the city; the current airport was completed in 1974.\n\nFollowing three years of work, a new terminal covering 42,000 square metres and capable of handling 4.5 million passengers per year, was unveiled on 6 June 2004. Costing a total of €81 million, the structure was designed by Willem Brouwer Architects and incorporated the original terminal building, which was developed into a 3000-square metre retail area. The new building has 40 check-in desks and ten boarding gates, five of which are equipped with jet bridges. It contains a wide variety of shops and restaurants, a wine bar, a small art gallery, and indoor garden areas featuring local flora.\n\nThe airport also is home to the Tourist Management department of the University of Sassari.\n\nFrom 3 February to 14 March 2020, the airport closed to passenger air traffic for the refurbishment and extension of the taxiways and runway. During this period, all flights arriving and departing were cancelled.  The airport building remained in this period open to events of various kinds.

It is also the title of an album by rap artist MC Frontalot. The term originated from Francis Bacon's 16th-century aphorism, \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" The phrase is credited to the English philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon, who published his essay titled \"Of Innovations\" in 1597. According to Bacon, the idea that people are driven by necessity to invent things originated with Plutarch, the Greek philosopher. In the essay, Bacon wrote: \"In the first place, to invent well, enter not upon it too rashly; hasty inventions have haply given present convenience, which in the issue have brought after-ages into infinite inconveniences.\" He went on to say, \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" The phrase has been used widely to describe the inventive process of invention—the drive to create something new or to solve a problem. It has also been used to encourage creativity and inspire people to come up with new ideas and solutions. While the phrase is most strongly related with invention, it has been used to describe the creative process for many other activities including writing, art-making, engineering, and music composition. The phrase has also been the title of books, albums, and television shows, such as the BBC Four documentary The Mother of Invention which aired in 2009, and MC Frontalot's 2006 album The Mother of Invention. The phrase is still widely used today, to motivate creative solutions and emphasize the power of invention. As Bacon’s quote suggest, creativity should be pursued with thought and caution—but with the potential for great reward.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27922055}

It is thought to have originated during the 16th century and is still a popular form of entertainment today. Mata Hati Telinga is a mix of martial arts and traditional dance. It is performed by two people, one being the leader, who perform various hand and foot attacks while simultaneously moving in a choreographed pattern. The technique is known to be very precise and intricate and can only be performed in the right environment. The performers usually wear scarves and tassels made of different colors, including yellow, green and red. The yellow signifies bravery, loyalty and harmony, the green represents happiness and joy, and the red represents passion and strength. This correlates with the movements in the dance, which focus on strength and grace. The lead performer also carries a knife and shield, which represent strength and protection. The lead dancer will use the knife to lead the dance and his movements must be precise and accurate. As the performance progresses, the dancers will become more and more inspiring and show their capabilities as performers. At the climax of the performance, the dancer executing the knife strikes will shout to the audience, symbolizing victory and the completion of the performance. The audience will then usually offer a standing ovation, showing their appreciation for the performance. Today, Mata Hati Telinga is believed to be a reflection of Minang culture. It is regarded as an expression of strength and respect, as well as a way to showcase skill and dedication. Mata Hati Telinga has been recognised as a significant form of traditional dance with elements and techniques that are distinct to the Minang people of West Sumatra.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54078207}

It is concerned with the relationships between music, culture, and spirituality within a particular culture or Indigenous population. Ethnodoxology is a growing area of interest in the field of theoretical and practical musicology, music education, and the broader field of ethnomusicology. The term “ethnodoxology” was coined in 1999 by Dr. Dale A. Olsen, an emeritus professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Since then, the term has been used by a variety of scholars to describe this academic field of study. As a sub-field of ethnomusicology, it is concerned with the impact of traditional music on a specific culture and religious expression, and the educational, spiritual, and social implications of that impact. The field of ethnodoxology focuses on understanding traditional music from the perspective of the people living the culture, which is distinct from the more objective perspective of Western musicology. Ethnodoxology seeks to examine music through an experiential approach, which places the cultural expressions at its center. Notable theorists within the field consider that traditional music contains a set of ontological and axiological characteristics that are fundamental to the culture and thus inextricably linked to its identity. For the practitioner, this means that ethnodoxology seeks to prioritize understanding traditional music within a culture before adapting it to any other purpose. This calls for a greater emphasis not only on learning the technical and sensory aspects of a particular style or piece, but also on understanding the cultural context to which those elements belong. Some have argued that the goal of ethnoixology is to “engage all aspects of music, including intellectual, physical, and spiritual,” as well as its historical, geographical, cultural, and social context. Through this emphasis on understanding, the field seeks to contribute to the growth of inter-cultural understanding and sensitivity. One of the primary goals of ethnodoxology is to contribute to the sustainability of traditional music and culture in an inter-cultural context.In this sense, its focus is centered on the educational, social, and political ramifications of music within a community, as well as its power to build bridges between different communities, ideologies, and generations. Practitioners of ethnodoxology seek to use the unique insights that traditional music can offer in the educational, musical, and spiritual realms. In essence, ethnodoxology seeks to look at music from a holistic perspective that takes into account the history, tradition, culture, and context of the people in order to develop an appreciation of the music. This field of study hopes to contribute to cultural dialogue, create bridges between cultures, and foster greater appreciation for the traditional musics of different cultures.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11512716}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia is the Malaysian zone of the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore & Australia in the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. It currently consists of a total of 16 parishes with 2,500 members nationwide.\n\nThe current bishop is the Rt. Rev. Joseph Mar Barnabas Episcopa.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nThe Mar Thoma Church has a unique history in Malaysia being one of the few major denominations and churches not set up by missionaries or ordained priests. Instead it was initiated by a group of Malayali immigrants that were then employed in British Malaya.\n\nMigrants from the Syrian Christian community of Kerala, are reported to have first arrived on the shores of the then Malaya as early as 1910. The Syrian Christian community was always a small community with only 70 Syrian Christians recorded in the census of 1930. Among the earliest was Isaac Benjamin (also known as the \"Ninan Inspector\") who was followed by K.C. George in 1911. K.C. George laid the foundation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaya by actively encouraging the movement of Syrian Christians from Kerala to Malaya, in spite of the dangers posed by malaria, rampant this country at that time.\n\nEarly Mar Thoma services generally took the form of prayer meetings in private homes. The first service following the Mar Thoma Service Order was held on the first Sundays of every month in the Jubilee School in Klang. This was followed in 1929 by regular services in the Penuel High School in Kuala Lumpur led by K. G. Mathew.\n\nThe first clergy arrives\nIn 1928, the Very Rev. V.P. Mammen (later Vicar General V. P. Mammen Kasseessa), the General Secretary of the Sunday School Samajam, visited Malaya and upon his return to India strongly recommended to the Sabha Council that a Syrian Christian priest be sent there,to meet the desire of Marthomites to hold formal worship services in Malayalam. In 1932, Mar Thoma members in Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Banting and Kuala Selangor passed a resolution to request a priest from India, who would be resident in Malaya for a few years.\n\nThe call was answered when the Rev. T.N. Koshy arrived from India in August 1936. Rev. T.N. Koshy travelled the length and breadth of Malaya and Singapore to minister to the spiritual needs of the Syrian Christian community who were already here and those who were still coming to Malaya. This led to the setting up of one single parish covering the whole of Malaya and Singapore and laid the foundations of another era in the history of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church marking the establishment of the first Mar Thoma parish outside of India.\n\nWar and peace\nWhile there were those who doubted the viability of creating a parish out of this scattered community, they had not reckoned on the steady growth of the population. While most Syrian Christians still thought of Malaya as a temporary sojourn, there were signs of increasing commitment to this country; one of the most important was the purchase of a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur, on which to construct a church. What was significant was that this purchase was made right at the height of the Japanese Occupation.\n\nWith the conclusion of the war, a spurt in migrations of Syrian Christians was seen as further opportunities in the plantation, civil/administrative services and educational sectors opened up. The Rev. V.E. Thomas (later Senior Vicar for Malaysia-Singapore); who was here during the war years; received ordination in 1947 in India and returned to assist to meet the need of the increasing membership. In September/October 1953, the first three church buildings of the Mar Thoma community in Malaya; all named after St. Thomas; (in Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Singapore) were consecrated by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Mathews Mar Athanasius during the first ever Episcopal visit to the fledgling Mar Thoma Church in Malaya and Singapore.\n\nIn 1958, the Rev. T.N. Koshy was elevated as the Vicar-General for Malaya in recognition of the valuable services he rendered in encouraging and fostering the growth of the church in Malaya.\n\nElevation as diocese\nWith the independence of Malaya in 1957, the number of parishes grew steadily and in 1962, the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore was constituted comprising 27 parishes. Although the community suffered from emigration, especially after the May 13 Incident of 1969, activity continued apace indicating the further indigenisation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaysia.\n\nIn 1982, the parishes in Malaysia and Singapore were constituted as the \"Malaysian Zone and the Singapore Zone of the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore respectively (now the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore and Australia).\n\nOrganisation and Symbols\n\nThe Zonal Assembly\nThe church convenes a Zonal Assembly annually as the highest decision making body of the church and it consists of elected representatives of the various parishes and organisations. Zonal assembly members are elected for a 3-year period. The Zonal council consisting of all the vicars, the zonal secretary, the zonal treasurer and three council members function as the decision making and operational arm of the church.\n\nLogo of the Mar Thoma Church\nThe logo of the Mar Thoma Church consists of a shield emblazoned with a Christian cross with the representation of the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. It is flanked on the right and left by a lotus and a hand lamp respectively. The motto; Lighted To Lighten; is written in English above the cross.\n The Motto\nThe role of the church is to spread the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every believer and member of the Church here in their position, wherever they are, are given the light so that they can lighten others.\n The Cross\nThe cross placed in the centre represents the centrality of Jesus Christ in the church and its mission. It is a proclamation that God (Purusha) himself came and atoned for all mankind and the redemption is freely available by faith in Jesus Christ without regard to any form of karma.\n The Ashoka Chakra\nThe Ashoka Chakra is the symbol of India and represents the Indian roots of the church. Traditionally the Chakra as presented by the Emperor Ashoka, was a symbol in denoting the Wheel of Life and Cosmic Order (or Dharmachakra). By placing the wheel at the heart of the Cross, it is a declaration that life finds its ultimate salvation in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus once and for all. It symbolises the completion and closing of the wheel of life for all those who follow the Bhakthi Marga (path of righteousness) in Jesu Maseeh'' (Jesus Christ).\n The Hand Lamp\nThe hand lamp represents the lamp that is carried in all believers. It reminds all believers to be the light of the world and act as a witness to give the light of salvation for others in their daily life. It also seeks to remind to pay diligent attention to the study of the word of God.\n The Lotus\nThe lotus represents holy living and is traditionally part of the offering of sacrifices of praise and adoration in the Indian tradition to God. It reminds believers to live holy despite the circumstances around them and exude the fragrance of God.\n\nSee also\n Christianity in Malaysia\n Mar Thoma Church\n\nExternal links\n Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia\n St. Thomas' Church, Klang\n\nReferences\n\nChurches in Malaysia\nSaint Thomas Christians\nChristian organizations established in 1962\nChristian denominations established in the 20th century", "machine_text": " The Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia (Malayalam: Mar Thoma Suriyani Sabha Malaysia), is a Reformed church, originating in Kerala, India, with Worldwide membership of over 1.6 Million.

He was the first to study them and showed that the fumeroles were located on an ancient volcano covered by mudflows. His discovery of the fossil remains of marine invertebrates at Rotoma, such as brachiopods, trilobites and corals, made him a respected authority on the Tertiary geology of New Zealand. Throughout his career, Talbot published numerous works on the geology of New Zealand, including a seminal paper on volcanic fumerole geology. His papers on paleontology and petrology established the basis for geological maps of the Auckland Province. Talbot also served on the geological survey of New Zealand and founded the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences in 1934.

The album was released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label, Artemisia Records. The album was produced collaboratively with Randall Dunn and recorded primarily in their own recording studio Owl Lodge in Olympia, Washington, which the Weaver brothers built themselves, with the drums recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle. Thrice Woven received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release.\n\nBackground \nThrice Woven is the first black metal album by Wolves in the Throne Room since 2011's Celestial Lineage, which the band consider the final chapter in a trilogy of albums comprising Two Hunters, Black Cascade, and Celestial Lineage. The band regard their 2014 ambient album Celestite as being a companion piece to Celestial Lineage, rather than a successor, and have also stated categorically that Thrice Woven is not connected with the previous records; as a result, Thrice Woven can be considered the band's first 'true' album since 2011. It is also the first album recorded almost entirely in the band's home studio Owl Lodge, and is their first album to feature new permanent band-member Kody Keyworth on guitars and vocals.\n\nRecording, production \nThe album was recorded almost entirely at the band's home studio, Owl Lodge, in Olympia, Washington. The band recorded the drums at Litho Studio in Seattle with Jack Shirley. According to Aaron Weaver, \"Once we finished the drums, we brought the sessions back to our studio in Olympia, Randall Dunn showed up and we kind of made a plan on how to put the record together.\" He also explained that \"Me and Nathan would work by ourselves, tracking guitars, synthesizers, whatever then Randall would show up and kind of check it out and give suggestions. He tracked a lot of stuff too — he always plays a little bit of synthesizer on our records. Once all the tracking was wrapped up, we met up with Randall again in Seattle and mixed at Avast! Studio\". In a separate interview, Aaron Weaver explained that \"About halfway through recording, we realized it was time to invite Kody Keyworth to be a full member of the band. He'd been playing guitar on the road with us for six years. As we were recording Thrice Woven, we just realized that Kody's got to be on this record — he's a part of this band from now on.\" As a result, Keyworth \"added flavor to Thrice Woven but was uninvolved in the initial work on these songs.\"\n\nMusical style, writing \nThrice Woven has been described as significantly more aggressive and traditionally black metal than many of the band's previous albums, and both critics and the band themselves have noted the role of new guitarist Kody Keyworth in the album's sound. NPR Music wrote that the album's opening track \"recalls the WITTR of Two Hunters and Black Cascade, but is immediately bolder, with a newfound ferocity that feels untethered to the past.\" Decibel noted that the album \"is defined in a good deal of traditionalism, specifically second-wave black metal traditionalism.\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek likewise noted that \"Thrice Woven re-engages with blackness, full signature riffs, epic tunes, and tales of pagan nature worship that established Wolves in the Throne Room's identity. This is a return to the pummeling, multi-layered power that made 2009's Black Cascade a masterpiece.\"\n\nRelease, promotion, marketing \nWolves in the Throne Room announced the initial details (including the track listing, release date, and album cover) of Thrice Woven on June 28, 2017, along with a brief teaser trailer. On July 17, the band premiered their first ever music video for the song \"Born from the Serpent's Eye\", featuring the first half of the nearly 10-minute piece. According to the band, \"We lit a bonfire and blasted through the first third of our song Born From The Serpent’s Eye. [sic] This is the first time we’d played the song with new guitarist Kody Keyworth and it fucking slayed. Peter and Nico captured the magic. May the good fires blaze!” On August 21 the band premiered the song \"Angrboda\" in full as part of Adult Swim's Singles 2017 series. On September 11, they also premiered the song \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean\" as a companion piece to the previously released \"Angrboda\". The album was officially released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label Artemisia Records.\n\nTouring \nThe band have announced they will tour the United States throughout Fall 2017 with Pillorian from September 29 to October 25. They have also announced a European tour from November 15 to December 15, 2017 with support from Aluk Todolo and Wiegedood.\n\nCritical reception \n\nThrice Woven was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCritics generally noted the considerably more aggressive and traditionally black metal approach of the album, particularly compared to the band's previous records. The A.V. Club wrote that \"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band’s live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld\", but noting that \"this being a WITTR record, the fury comes in crashing waves, emerging monstrously from stretches of placid calm\" Decibel named the album 'Best New Noise' and praised Thrice Woven as \"a return to the glories of old\", highlighting the strength of the songwriting in particular.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nWolves in the Throne Room \n Nathan Weaver — vocals, guitars\n Aaron Weaver — drums, synthesizers\n Kody Keyworth — guitars, vocals\n\nAdditional musicians \n Don McGreey — acoustic guitar (on track 1)\n Steve Von Till — vocals, acoustic guitar (on track 2)\n Anna Von Hausswolff — vocals (on tracks 1 and 4)\n Phil Petrocelli — percussion (on track 4)\n Zeynep Oyku Yilmaz — grand harp (on track 4)\n\nTechnical and additional personnel \n Randall Dunn — production, engineering\n Jason Ward — mastering\n Jack Shirley — engineering\n William Smith — additional engineering\n Denis Forkas Kostromitin — artwork\n John Westrock — photography\n\nReferences \n\n2017 albums\nWolves in the Throne Room albums\nBlack metal albums by American artists", "machine_text": " Thrice Woven is the ninth full-length studio album by American metalcore band Wolves in the Throne Room, released on May 18, 2018 through their label, Artemisia Records. Taking its title from a line of the epic poem Beowulf, the album was recorded in the band's hometown of Olympia, Washington and was self-produced by the band, with Don Tyler serving as additional engineering. The band once more embraced neoclassical leanings with Thrice Woven, using stringed instrumentation to rock-influenced black metal within the album's nine songs. Its overall sound has been described by the band as \"The return of heavy druidic metal\". Among those who contributed to the album are Rachel Corrigan, who recorded strings and keyboards for two tracks, and Isaiah \"Izzy\" Maroney of Drone Thrones, who provided additional rhythm and acoustic guitar. Also featured is veteran vocalist Steve Von Till of Neurosis. Created between 2015 and 2016, Thrice Woven was described by the band as being about \"exploring the link between nature, spirit and metal\". Its themes deal heavily with northern European folk narratives, as well as personal insight into the lives of the band members. Lyricism throughout the album reflects upon moments of desperation and growth, as well as the acceptance of our mortality and the struggles of healing. Musically, Thrice Woven is the most song-oriented and layered album of the band's discography. Much of the songs delivered heavy riffs and drums, backed with complex melodic and tremolo guitar parts and string arrangments. This resulted in a grandiose and cinematic approach often featured within its works. The album was met with generally positive reception amongst critics and fans alike. With its release, Wolves in the Throne Room toured Europe, Australia, and North America. References: 1. \"Thrice Woven\" by Wolves in the Throne Room - Encyclopaedia Metallum.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of current monarchs of sovereign states\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A monarch is the head of a monarchy, a form of government in which a state is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.\n\nA variety of titles are applied in English; for example, \"king\" and \"queen\", \"prince\" and \"princess\", \"emperor\" and \"empress\". Although they will be addressed differently in their local languages, the names and titles in the list below have been styled using the common English equivalent. Roman numerals, used to distinguish related rulers with the same name, have been applied where typical.\n\nIn political and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both historical and contemporary contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined using a variety of distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.\n\nEntries below are listed beside their respective dominions, which are organised alphabetically. These monarchs reign as head of state in their respective sovereign states. Monarchs reigning over a constituent division, cultural or traditional polity are listed under constituent monarchs.

It is an important part of the area's cultural heritage. The castle has been listed as a monument historique since 1840. The castle stands in a prominent position and is protected by two deep moats. It is constructed with stone and is still in good condition. The castle has two main parts: the château and its grounds. The former includes two towers, two crenelated walls, a gatehouse and a courtyard, while the latter includes a garden with ancient trees and a fountain. The main tower of the château was destroyed in the 16th century during the Wars of Religion, but was later rebuilt. In addition, other structures were added at various times, including an 18th-century pigeon house, a pavilion, an old chapel and a French garden. The most interesting feature of Vézins is the trompe l'oeil painted by French artist Gaston Lenôtre in the 19th century. This illusionistic decoration creates the effect that the walls of the castle are draped in a curtain or fabric, with tassels and cords. The painting is considered to one of the best examples of trompe l'oeil art. Today, the castle is open to visitors who can take part in guided tours.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rondout Creek\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Rondout Creek is a  tributary of the Hudson River in Ulster and Sullivan counties, New York, United States. It rises on Rocky Mountain in the eastern Catskills, flows south into Rondout Reservoir, part of New York City's water supply network, then into the valley between the Catskills and the Shawangunk Ridge, where it goes over High Falls and finally out to the Hudson at Kingston, receiving along the way the Wallkill River.\n\nThe name of Rondout Creek comes from the fort, or redoubt, that was erected near its mouth. The Dutch equivalent of the English word redoubt (meaning a fort or stronghold) is reduyt. In the Dutch records of Wildwyck, however, the spelling used to designate this same fort is invariably Ronduyt during the earliest period, with the present form rondout (often capitalized) appearing as early as November 22, 1666.\n\nThe Rondout Creek became economically important in the 19th century when the Delaware and Hudson Canal followed closely alongside it from Napanoch to the village of Rondout, now part of Kingston, which grew rapidly as the canal's northern port. Today it is important not only for the reservoir, but for the fishing and other recreational opportunities it provides.\n\nDue to the Wallkill, it drains a vast area stretching over  all the way down to Sussex County, New Jersey. The high mountains around its upper course and the reservoir, which collects water from three others, also add to its flow.\n\nCourse\nThe Rondout goes through several different stages because of the changes in surrounding geography and past development, such as the canal and reservoir, that has drawn on its waters. Its headwaters, above the reservoir, are a typical mountain stream. Below the reservoir it remains fairly rocky but widens into the floor of a narrow valley. At Napanoch, where it turns northeast and receives its first significant tributary, the Ver Nooy Kill, it becomes wider, as does the valley it drains, and deeper.\n\nNorth of the Shawangunks, where the Wallkill trickles down from Sturgeon Pool, it is wide enough to be referred to as the Rondout River at some points. At Creeklocks, the former northern outlet of the canal, it becomes wide and deep enough to be navigable, and several marinas line the banks of the stream, now more than  wide, at Kingston just above its mouth.\n\nCatskills and headwaters\n\nRising below the col between Rocky Mountain and Balsam Cap, the Rondout Creek flows generally southerly down the slopes of Rocky Mountain into a narrow valley, receiving tributary Picket Brook on the left and three unnamed streams from the slopes of Peekamoose Mountain to the right. A mile or two from its source, it reaches some private lands and its first road, Peekamoose Road (Ulster County 42). It has dropped  in its first two miles. It turns to the southwest to follow a wider valley, known informally as Peekamoose Gorge. Most of the land surrounding the creek is part of New York's Forest Preserve, \"forever wild\" and thus undeveloped. The rocky stream boasts several popular swimming holes, one of which is known as Blue Hole for the greenish tone of the deep water within. South of the small outlet stream from Peekamoose Lake, it is crossed and then followed by Peekamoose Road, which at first runs high above the creek but then close by it.\n\nAlong here it receives several tributaries from the right — Buttermilk Falls Brook, with its eponymous waterfall near its mouth, High Falls Brook and Bear Hole Brook — most of them rising, like the Rondout itself, in the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area to the west. To the east is another Forest Preserve management unit, the Sundown Wild Forest. Some unnamed tributaries come from here. Because of the protected areas on both sides of the creek and the ease of public access, this area has become one of the Catskills' popular trout streams, and fly-fishermen can be seen here during the season.\n\nIt crosses under Peekamoose Road, here also carrying the Long Path hiking trail, again just north of a popular camping area in the small Peekamoose Wild Forest, and then passes the hamlet of Sundown and widens slightly as a floodplain develops alongside. The land along the creek is now largely in private hands, and there is little public access to it as it crosses into Sullivan County.\n\nReservoir to Napanoch\nAfter crossing under NY 55A, it widens into the reservoir just below Grahamsville and begins flowing more to the east-southeast. Routes 55 and 55A bracket the reservoir to the south and north respectively. One-third of the way along the reservoir's  length, it crosses back into Ulster County. Now at an elevation of , the creek resumes at the site of the former hamlet of Lackawack, leaving the Catskill Park, now headed eastwards, in a rocky, wider streambed through some slightly more development.\n\nIt follows closely alongside Route 55, deviating from it only when it turns north to Honk Lake, another impoundment. Past here it crosses under 55 again and comes into Napanoch. After crossing under US 209 and receiving the Ver Nooy Kill it bends northeast, paralleling the Shawangunk Ridge and the edge of the Catskill Plateau.\n\nRondout Valley\nThe creek, here wider and deeper, forms the bed of a widening valley as it continues northeast past Eastern Correctional Facility, where the first remnant of the canal, an empty ditch next to an old railroad station, can be found alongside. The creek continues towards Kerhonkson, where Route 55 and US 44 cross over. US 209 continues paralleling the Rondout towards High Falls, as it begins to curve to the east around the northern end of the ridge.\n\nHere, it goes over the spectacular waterfall that gives the community its name, just below NY 213. These were the subject of controversy in recent years, since they were considered both a popular swimming hole and an attractive nuisance. The local fire department, which owned the land, had to sell it to keep its liability insurance premiums affordable, and the new owner has posted the property for the same reason.\n\nLower Rondout and Kingston\n\nAround the north end of the Shawangunks, it receives as tributaries many of the streams of the Minnewaska State Preserve: Peters Kill, Stony Kill and Coxing Kill. It begins to curve more to the east again. Route 213 replaces Route 209 as the Rondout's paralleling road, with the canal's empty ditch running next to both along the way to Rosendale, the next settlement, which grew up around the canal and, later, a local cement industry that used the creek to get its product to market.\n\nHere it crosses under Route 213 and NY 32 in a gravel-lined flood control channel, but returns to a more natural bed shortly afterwards to flow beneath the New York State Thruway. In the wooded areas east of the Thruway, the Wallkill River, its flow attenuated by Sturgeon Pool just upriver, joins in from the south. The Rondout turns north, then east again, crossing Route 213 again. At Creeklocks the last lock and the end of the canal are still visible.\n\nIn Kingston itself it widens and flows under a pair of bridges, the historic Kingston–Port Ewen Suspension Bridge, which carried US 9W until the construction of the neighboring John T. Loughran Bridge. The city's West Strand neighborhood along the waterfront has been rejuvenated in recent years and many boats can be seen moored at docks here on summer weekends. Old shipbuilders' factories line the northern bank, and one of them has been converted into the Hudson River Maritime Museum. After a slight curve through swampier, less developed lowlands in the Kingston Point neighborhood, the Rondout empties into the Hudson at Rondout Lighthouse, just opposite Rhinecliff.\n\nHistory\n\nColonial era\nThe early Dutch settlers realized the value of the creek for their colonial ambitions. However, the contention that a trading post or fort was established at the mouth of the Rondout in the early part of the 17th century is thoroughly debunked in Marc B. Fried's The Early History of Kingston and Ulster County, NY, pp. 3–14 and 155–61. The first non-Native structure at this location was undoubtedly the house of settler Christoffel Davits in 1653, and a fort was built here by the colonial government in 1660. The local Native Americans likewise frequented the area. In 1652, an Englishman, Thomas Chambers, became the first to acquire a land deed from the Indians, nearby, along the Esopus Creek (which has a vast expanse of good farmland), and thus began the genesis of present-day Kingston. The Rondout's role in the area's early settlement was as a port for the settlement that was made along the Esopus Creek [The Early History of Kingston, chapter 2]\n\nCanal era\n\nSettlement did slowly progress inland, but it was not until well after American independence that the Rondout would become economically important. In the early 1820s two Philadelphia businessmen realized the immense profits that could be made if they could find a way to get the mostly unmined high-quality anthracite coal from undeveloped Northeastern Pennsylvania to the lucrative markets of New York City. Railroads had not yet been perfected, so they saw the possibility of a canal running from Honesdale, Pennsylvania, to the Hudson at what was then the village of Rondout. In 1828 they obtained a charter for their company to do this, and the Delaware and Hudson Canal was opened a few years later. Coal was transferred from canal barges to river ships at Rondout, and it became a boomtown quickly. The canal remained a prosperous operation until late in the 19th century when rail transportation finally became more affordable, and ended its days in 1904 after a brief period carrying Rosendale cement. The former terminal port area for the canal is now Kingston's Rondout-West Strand Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nReservoir era\nIn the mid-20th century, the stream would find another important use. Naturalist John Burroughs had anticipated it when he explored the upper headwaters with a friend early in the century, writing in his essay \"A Bed of Boughs\" of the purity of the stream's waters and its benefits for both man and fish:\n\nStarting in 1915 with Ashokan Reservoir, New York City had been expanding its water supply system with reservoirs in the Catskills. In 1937 it began construction of Merriman Dam near Lackawack, which would soon be flooded forever to allow the growing city to tap the pure waters Burroughs had written about. Those waters began to reach city taps in 1951, and the reservoir itself was completed three years later. Today, via the Delaware Aqueduct, and the connections it has via the Neversink Aqueduct to the Neversink, Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs to the west supplementing the upper Rondout's drainage, it supplies half the city's daily water draw.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of New York\nList of crossings of Rondout Creek\nMV Rip Van Winkle\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nRivers of New York (state)\nTributaries of the Hudson River\nRivers of Ulster County, New York\nRivers of Sullivan County, New York", "machine_text": " Rondout Creek is a 44.3-mile long tributary of the Hudson River in Ulster and Sullivan Counties, New York. It is one of the Hudson River's largest and most important tributaries, providing over two thirds of the river's fresh water supply. The Rondout is fed by the waters of several other streams, beginning high in the Catskill Mountains and flowing south and east before emptying into the Hudson River near Kingston. The mayor of Rondout Creek was discovered in 1609 by Henry Hudson while searching for the Northwest Passage. The creek was subsequently used as a transportation route by colonial pioneers and eventually connected to the Erie Canal. The creek also provided critical transportation to industries located along its route. An important center of anthracite coal mining and related industries, the creek was the site of the great anthracite rail boycott of 1902, a major landmark in American labor history. Today, Rondout Creek is a major recreation destination for kayaking, canoeing and fishing. The creek was designated an \"Outstanding Water Resource\" in 2009. The most popular sections for kayaking and canoeing are the sections from the Sam's Point Preserve to its confluence with the Hudson River. The creek is also home to a variety of fish and other aquatic life, including brown trout and largemouth bass. In addition to being an important recreational asset for the region, Rondout Creek also serves many environmental functions. The creek is home to numerous species of aquatic life, including the endangered dwarf wedgemussel. It also provides recreational opportunities to local communities, while also supporting a healthy and productive riparian ecosystem along its banks. Rondout Creek is part of America’s industrial history, and its winding route is also a sign of its enduring importance to the Hudson Valley region. As an important recreational resource and environmental asset, Rondout Creek helps to bring life and vitality to the communities that surround it.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2256448}

He was born in Verona, New York, and graduated from Hobart College in 1891. After traveling and teaching in the Melanesian Archipelago, he became superintendent and director of the London Missionary Society's South Seas evangelistic enterprise in 1902. He is credited with establishing the foundation for one of the largest and most successful missions in that region. Codding was sent to the South Seas by the London Missionary Society in 1895, where he spent the rest of his life working to bring the Gospel to the heathen over an immense range of islands known as Melanesia. During the span of his ministry in the region he planted over 160 churches and ordained 430 native pastors. He recorded more than one thousand names on his family register. The custom of head-hunting, common among the islanders at the time of Codding's arrival, was replaced by Christian worship services during his time there. He also popularized the phrase \"sons of Solomon\", which became the nickname of the islanders. In recognition of his missionary spirit, Codding was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the University of Edinburgh in 1926 and the Order of the British Empire in 1928. In addition to his Christian message, Codding was a great social reformer and wrote numerous books and articles on Melanesian society. He wrote largely of his trials and tribulations as a missionary and his experiences in the \"island world\" as a form of cultural documentation. His works include: \"Things Seen in the South Seas\" and \"Light in the Islands\". Codding returned to California shortly before his death and is interred in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. He had been a lifelong friend of the Roosevelt family, who attended his funeral. After his death, his widow, Ethel, hired a sculptor to create a bronze statue of Codding in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Codding is remembered today for his pioneering work in the South Seas. He helped to bring the Gospel to the regions of the Pacific islands, establishing educational and medical facilities, building churches and helping to reform island culture. His impact on the region can still be seen today in the islanders’ reverence for Christianity and the deep religious faith they practice. Codding will always be remembered as a great missionary, whose life and work left an indelible mark in the islands he visited.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7425688}

The film is about the social injustice and exploitation faced by migrant labourers in Goa, and is set in the 1990s. It was co-produced by people from India, France and Netherlands (Thin Air, Three Rivers, Kepler Films, Cine-Sud Promotion) under the banner of Goa Film Bazaar, with some of the editing done in Paris.\n\nThe film premiered at the Hong Kong International Film Festival in April 2017, and was also chosen for the Karlovy Vary Film Festival. It became the first Konkani film to be commercially released in France. Juze also became the first Konkani film to be selected for mentoring and promotion during Film Bazaar, the filmmaking lab organised by National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) in Goa, in 2015. It was featured at the Mumbai Film Festival in October 2017, at the 48th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in the Indian Panorama section in November 2017, the Minsk Film Festival in Belarus (where it won an award) and the Dublin International Film Festival in Ireland. The film was finally released in Goa, with an \"A\" certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), in April 2018.\n\nPlot \nThe story is set in the 1990s. Santosh (Rushikesh Naik) is a teenage boy studying in Class X. He lives in a slum in Borimol village with his grandmother, referred to as Tai (played by Prashanti Talpankar; Tai translates to \"aunt\"). It is revealed that Tai's son, Santosh's father, had killed Santosh's mother and had been arrested, leaving Tai and Santosh to fend for themselves. Thus, despite being native Goans, they are forced to live with other migrants from poorer parts of the country and work for Juze (Sudesh Bhise). With his business of manufacturing cashew feni and his political connections (which consist of the local politician), Juze terrorizes the whole village, even going so far as to physically abuse and rape the women.\n\nSantosh is an intelligent boy and scores well in class. He frequently skips work to go to school. This frequently gets him in trouble with Juze, who often beats him up publicly. Juze's wife Maria (Gauri Kamat) recognizes Santosh's intelligence and demands that he help her son, who is weak in studies. She also forces him to perform sexual favours for her. Meanwhile, Santosh has a budding romance with his classmate, Maya (Barkha Naik). However, their relationship slowly breaks apart when she realizes the helplessness of his situation. All of this ultimately leads to Santosh confronting Juze with a friend and beating him to death. Santosh then runs away from the village, and is seen waiting tables at a beachside shack.\n\nCast \n Rushikesh Naik as Santosh\n Prashanti Talpankar as Tai, Santosh's grandmother\n Sudesh Bhise as Juze\n Gauri Kamat as Maria, Juze's wife\n Barkha Naik as Maya\n\nProduction\n\nThe film is partially based on writer-director Miransha Naik's childhood experiences. The film is set in the 90s, making the character Santosh the same age as Miransha was then. The film is also set in Naik's hometown of Borimol village. He admits that some of the events and characters have been adapted from real life. He named the movie after the villain as he found it unique. He believes that the events revolve around Juze, and even though the movie is about Santosh’s journey, it simultaneously portrays the downfall of Juze.\n\nIt may be noted that Naik lost both his parents to illness at the age of 9. He grew up in Borimol along with his grandmother and two sisters, coming third in his Class X exams. He dropped out within a year of joining the BCom course at Government College, Quepem, to contribute to his household by working as a waiter. His grandmother passed away when he was 19, and he had to take responsibility of the marriages of his two sisters. By waiting tables for nearly five years, he made enough money to set up his own beachside shack, named Blue Corner, on Benaulim Beach. Two scenes in Juze show the village children watching Subhash Ghai’s Karz and Hero, which is reminiscent of Naik and his young friends and his love for movies.\n\nInitially, Naik chose a Mumbai-based actor for the role of Juze's wife, Maria, as he wasn't confident that local artistes would be up to a role with a number of sex scenes. However, the chosen actor couldn't perform because of her language barrier. Naik then turned to Gauri Kamat upon many recommendations, and after some initial hesitation, she agreed to play the part. However, by late 2015, they faced an even bigger problem: shortage of funds even before post-production. It was then that Naik thought of National Film Development Corporation’s annual \"Film Bazaar\", where it attracted the attention of noted producer Olivia Stewart, who procured funds from the Netherlands-based production company Keplerfilm and the France-based production company of Cine-Sud Promotions.

In India, juze is mainly found in certain states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat to refer to a district, tehsil, and other administrative divisions. In Scotland, a juze is an electoral unit comprising an urban area, plus its surrounding rural areas. Juze areas are typically comprised of several wards and are used to represent constituencies in local authorities in Scotland. Generally, a juze will have at least three wards, but this may increase to four or five if necessary. Juzes are the main unit of representation in local authorities in Scotland, with local elections taking place on a juze basis. In Saudi Arabia, juz is an administrative division used to group various geographical locations for taxation, military service, and/or other social services. Juz divisions are used in various areas in the Saudi Arabian provinces; however, they are mainly found in the Jazan, Hail, Tabuk, and Quran regions. In India, juze refer to a district, tehsil, and other administrative divisions. A district usually consists of several tehsils, each of which is an administrative division comprising several villages or cities and its surrounding rural areas. The tehsil or district can be sub-divided into several juzes, which typically are smaller administrative units than a tehsil or district. Each juze is composed of villages or cities, their associated rural areas, and urban villages, with each juze having its own local government and administrative structure. The term juze is also found in numerous other countries. In Iran, a juze is an administrative division used to group various geographical locations in the province of Astarabad. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, juz is a term used to refer to the country’s municipalities. In Serbia, juz can refer to local government administrative divisions. Lastly, in Indonesia, juze is a type of administrative village division that subdivides a district. Overall, juze is used to refer to a variety of geographical locations, administrative divisions, and electoral units in several countries.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Turning the other cheek\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turning the other cheek is a phrase in Christian doctrine from the Sermon on the Mount that refers to responding to injury without revenge and allowing more injury. This passage is variously interpreted as accepting one's predicament, commanding nonresistance or advocating Christian pacifism.\n\nScriptural references\nThe phrase originates from the Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament. In the Gospel of Matthew chapter 5, an alternative for \"an eye for an eye\" is given by Jesus:\n\nIn the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke chapter 6, as part of his command to \"love your enemies\", Jesus says:\n\nInterpretations\nThis phrase, as with much of the Sermon on the Mount, has been subject to both literal and figurative interpretations.\n\nChristian anarchist interpretation \n\nAccording to this interpretation the passages call for total nonresistance to the point of facilitating aggression against oneself, and since human governments defend themselves by military force, some have advocated Christian anarchism, including Leo Tolstoy who elucidated his reasoning in his 1894 book The Kingdom of God Is Within You.\n\nNonviolent resistance interpretation\nThe scholar Walter Wink, in his book Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination, interprets the passage as ways to subvert the power structures of the time.\n\nAt the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person \"turned the other cheek,\" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.\n\nWink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10–13). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20–23).\n\nWink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions. In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law.\n\nSee also\n\n Brotherly love (philosophy)\n Christian pacifism\n Expounding of the Law#Retaliation\n Live by the sword, die by the sword\n Matthew 5:29, Matthew 10\n Tolstoyan\n Violence begets violence\n Law of attraction (New Thought)\n Just war theory\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Jim Douglass, Lightning from East to West: Jesus, Gandhi, and the nuclear age, 1983\n\nExternal links\n Christian Nonviolence\n The Limits of \"Turn The Other Cheek\"\n\nDoctrines and teachings of Jesus\nChristian nonviolence\nChristian terminology\nEthical principles\nNew Testament words and phrases\nSermon on the Mount\nGospel of Matthew\nMatthew 5\nNonviolence", "machine_text": " Turning the other cheek is one of the most recognized and important teachings of Christianity and as such has been quoted by many prominent figures and theologians throughout history. It is a concept full of complex spiritual implications, and exemplifies one of the most powerful and fundamental Christian values. The phrase first appears in the New Testament of the Bible in a passage from the Sermon on the Mount, which is attributed to the words of Jesus. It reads: \"You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" (NIV, Matthew 5:38-39) The phrase \"turning the other cheek\" has been interpreted in many ways over the years. Broadly speaking, it refers to the idea of \"forgiveness\" in the face of hurt, injustice, and oppression. It suggests we should not retaliate when faced with evil and injustice, but instead, we should find it in our hearts to show compassion and understanding. Turning the other cheek is seen as a much more meaningful and effective response than a violent reaction which can only lead to more hurt and violence. By responding without violence, Christians can take a moral stand and exemplify their faith while standing up to evil. In the modern world, the concept of turning the other cheek has become the standard for compassionate and responsible behavior, and is a crucial part of living a meaningful and peaceful life. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader in the civil rights movement, often spoke of the importance of turning the other cheek, where he stated \"We must love our white brothers, no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out across the centuries, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you'.\" Turning the other cheek is more than just an example of kindness and compassion, it is an example of strength and courage that stands in the face of evil and oppression. It reminds us that we can reclaim our power and self-esteem, and prevent future hurt, by responding peacefully and thoughtfully in the face of danger or mistreatment. It helps us to look beyond our own needs and see the needs of others, and act in the best interest of all. In summary, turning the other cheek is one of the most significant teachings in Christianity, where it carries the powerful message to rise above injustice and to not allow hurt and violence beget more hurt and violence. It is an example of responding with compassion, and of reclaiming our power by responding peacefully and thoughtfully in the face of evil.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44282}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cyclone Savannah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cyclone Savannah was a strong tropical cyclone that brought significant impacts to Java and Bali and minor impacts to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands during March 2019. It was the sixteenth tropical low, sixth tropical cyclone and third severe tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. Savannah developed from a tropical low that formed well to the east of Christmas Island on 8 March. The system was slow to develop initially, but reached tropical cyclone intensity on 13 March after adopting a southwesterly track. Savannah underwent rapid intensification and reached peak intensity on 17 March as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. Ten-minute sustained winds were estimated as , with a central barometric pressure of 951 hPa (28.08 inHg). One-minute sustained winds reached  at this time, equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Weakening commenced soon afterwards, and responsibility for the system passed from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to Météo-France. As it moved into the new region, Savannah became the eighth of a record-breaking ten intense tropical cyclones in the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Savannah was downgraded to a tropical depression on 20 March, and its remnants dissipated in the central Indian Ocean on 24 March.\n\nSavannah brought significant impacts to Java and Bali early in its lifetime. Prolonged heavy rainfall and river level rise led to widespread flooding and landslides throughout the region. Floodwaters impacted scores of villages, causing damage to thousands of homes, submerging thousands of hectares of agricultural land and cutting off access to key infrastructure and services. Thousands of families were affected during the event, with evacuations occurring both before and after the flooding. According to local media reports, the total damage and economic losses caused by the disaster exceeded Rp106 billion (US$7.5 million). Ten people were reported to have died during the event, making Savannah the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Tropical Cyclone Cempaka in 2017. News reports also indicate that at least five people were injured and that one person went missing during the disaster.\n\nMeteorological history \n\nDuring early March, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian oscillation tracked eastwards across the tropical Indian Ocean and into the Maritime Continent. The pulse brought with it weak monsoonal conditions to the north of Australia, as well as an atmospheric environment that was favourable for tropical cyclogenesis. On 8 March, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) noted the formation of a weak tropical low (identifier 17U) within a monsoon trough stretching from Java to the Solomon Islands—one of several tropical lows that would develop within this trough. Located south of Bali, Indonesia, and approximately 970 km (605 mi) east of Christmas Island, the nascent tropical low began moving slowly westwards. Tracking roughly parallel to the southern coastline of Java, the system passed just to the south of Christmas Island at 06:00 UTC on 11 March, before turning to the northwest.\n\nThe tropical low executed a poleward turn on 12 March, assuming a course to the southwest by the following day. Tracking away from Indonesia, the storm began to strengthen in a generally favourable environment. The BOM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale at 18:00 UTC on 13 March as it was approaching the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and gave it the name Savannah. Six hours later, the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicated that the system had reached tropical storm strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued as Savannah passed approximately 110 km (70 mi) to the west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the system reached Category 2 late on 14 March. Savannah became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone the following day, and adopted a track to the west-southwest under the influence of a high-pressure ridge in the mid-troposphere further to the south. The storm began to strengthen quickly on 16 March, reaching peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale at 06:00 UTC the following day, making it the then-strongest storm of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. The BOM estimated ten-minute sustained winds to be at , gusting to , with a central barometric pressure of 951 hPa (28.08 inHg). The JTWC analysed the storm to be producing one-minute sustained winds of , making the system equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.\n\nSavannah soon began to weaken, with ten-minute sustained winds decreasing to  twelve hours later. By 00:00 UTC on 18 March, the system tracked over the 90th meridian east and into the South-West Indian Ocean cyclone region, and hence responsibility for the storm transitioned to Météo-France (MFR) at La Réunion. According to the scale used by MFR, Savannah was reclassified as an tropical cyclone. Immediately upon entering the region, increasing westerly vertical wind shear allowed dry air to become entrained in the storm's circulation. A rapid weakening trend ensued, despite the warm sea surface temperatures in the vicinity. The system's deep convection proceeded to unravel, leaving the low-level circulation centre exposed, and ten-minute sustained winds decreased to  by 00:00 UTC on 19 March. As the convective structure weakened further, Savannah was downgraded to a gale-force remnant tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on 20 March. The system turned briefly east-southeastwards before adopting a track towards the west-northwest on 21 March. The JTWC downgraded Savannah below tropical storm status at 12:00 UTC that day. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Savannah was last mentioned by MFR on 23 March, and dissipated by 12:00 UTC the next day in the central Indian Ocean.\n\nImpacts\n\nIndonesia \n\nThe Indonesian islands of Java and Bali were significantly affected by Savannah's precursor tropical low during the first half of March. Very heavy rainfall occurred across large parts of the islands as the tropical low tracked westwards, causing rapid river level rise, flooding and many landslides. A total of ten people lost their lives during the disaster, making Savannah the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Tropical Cyclone Cempaka, which killed at least 41 people in Java in November 2017.\n\nThe Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics indicated that 148 mm (5.8 in) of precipitation fell in parts of Yogyakarta during 17 March. The regency of Bantul, located downstream from six major rivers, as well as the neighbouring Purworejo Regency, experienced widespread flooding with depths of up to 2 m (7 ft). More than 5,000 residents were forced to evacuate, and access to electricity to was cut by the floodwaters. Numerous landslides in Bantul were also triggered by the extreme rainfall, causing damage and hampering rescue and evacuation efforts. One landslide in Bantul's Imogiri district destroyed two houses at the bottom of a cliff, killing three people, and leaving one more missing. Another person was later swept away by floodwaters, and another was killed when a wall collapsed.\n\nThe economic losses that occurred in Madiun Regency were the worst in two decades, with damages and losses amounting to more than Rp54 billion (US$3.8 million), and more than 5,700 families affected by the disaster. 5,086 houses were damaged by floodwaters throughout the region, and flooding and landslides destroyed three bridges and covered many roads, impeding transportation. A car crash occurred on a wet road in Madiun, resulting in the death of a five-year-old boy and serious injuries to two adults. 497 hectares (1230 acres) of rice fields were submerged, causing crops to fail and farmers to harvest early to prevent further damage. Significant livestock losses also occurred, including cows, goats and more than 4,000 chickens. In the nearby village of Klumutan, inundation of up to 5 m (16 ft) in depth damaged hundreds of houses. Two residents in a village in Madiun died of illness during the event, but were unable to be buried initially due to the flooding of the local cemetery.\n\nFurther damage and agricultural losses occurred in the regencies of Ngawi, Tulungagung, Bojonegoro and Ponorogo, totalling more than Rp51 billion (US$3.6 million). In Ngawi, flooding caused approximately 1,400 hectares (3,460 acres) of agricultural land to become submerged, and damages and economic losses in that regency alone reached Rp33.2 billion (US$2.35 million). 1,183 hectares (2,923 acres) of agricultural land was damaged by flooding in Tulungagung, with crops of rice, melon, chili, long bean and onion affected. In Bojonegoro, flooding of the Solo River resulted in widespread impacts. Inundation occurred in 48 villages, affecting more than 1,600 families and causing 50 families to evacuate. A total of 2,097 hectares (5182 acres) of rice fields were submerged by the river water, as well as two kindergartens and three schools. Even after beginning to recede, the level of the Solo River was at above 27.44 m (90.03 ft) in Karangnongko District, causing the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management to issue red alerts for riverine flooding for areas further downstream. Flooding in Ponorogo from the Solo River caused five bridges to collapse, and submerged 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of rice crops.\n\nCombined damage in the regencies of Magetan, Sukoharjo, Klaten and Bulelung exceeded Rp2 billion (US$140,000). In Magetan, flooding of several rivers caused significant damage to infrastructure, agricultural land and residential areas. 100 people were stranded when nearly 500 houses were flooded in two villages, and damage to roads further inhibited access to affected areas. Losses were sustained on agricultural land, and livestock were killed by the flooding. 379 hectares (937 acres) of rice fields were inundates in Sukoharjo, and flooding of the Gamping River in Klaten submerged 738 hectares (1,820 acres) of rice fields. In Bulelung in northern Bali, heavy rainfall caused a river that was clogged with garbage and wood to overflow, damaging roads, bridges and electricity infrastructure. A government-subsidised housing complex sustained damage from the flooding, with one house being swept away by the floodwaters.\n\nFour tourists were killed and three others were injured in Magelang Regency in central Java on 13 March. The victims had been tubing along the rapids in a river when they were overcome by flash flooding. Several villages in the Pasuruan Regency were affected by flooding, with roads and residential areas becoming inundated. Water levels reaching as high as 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in Kebrukan Village.\n\nAustralia \n\nThe Australian territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands experienced minor impacts as Savannah passed nearby. During 11 March, Savannah's precursor tropical low passed just to the south of Christmas Island. At that time, the system had ten-minute sustained winds of only about . As such, no strong winds were recorded on the island. A maximum gust of  was observed at 20:05 UTC on 12 March once the system had strengthened further after moving away to the west. A total of 60.2 mm (2.4 in) of rainfall was recorded on Christmas Island during the seven days from 8–14 March. The system made its closest approach to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 14 March, after intensification into a Category 1 tropical cyclone. In preparation for the system's anticipated impacts on the islands, the BOM began issuing tropical cyclone advice products for residents and local authorities at 06:50 UTC on 13 March. Strong sustained winds were experienced on the islands, peaking at gale-force, and a maximum gust of  was recorded at 21:35 UTC on 13 March. The wind caused defoliation and vegetation damage on the islands, as well as minor damage to property, but no injuries were reported. Tropical cyclone advice publications were discontinued at 06:50 UTC on 14 March as the system tracked further away from the islands. Over the ten days from 9–18 March, 62.6 mm (2.5 in) of rainfall was recorded at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport on West Island, the territory's capital.\n\nAftermath \n\nFollowing the significant damage caused by the weather system, the Ponorogo Regency government committed to conduct dredging operations to widen the Solo River in order to mitigate future flooding impacts. The government also indicated that they would attempt to quickly rebuild damaged bridges through a special allocation of budget resources for the disaster response. Additionally, residents were urged to refrain from disposing of rubbish in the river, as it was noted that this could exacerbate the risk and impacts of flooding. Significant rubbish pollution resulting in river clogging was also observed in the Bulelung Regency in Bali, where it was regarded as a contributing factor to the flooding.\n\nThe East Java government allocated Rp100 billion (US$7.1 million) in funding for local governments that declared states of emergency in their local regions due to flooding. The money was intended to cover logistics, equipment, human resources and other necessities for disaster relief and cleanup efforts. Farmers who were affected by the disaster were also able to access Rp6 million (US$420) in compensation from local governments for every hectare (2.5 acres) of damaged agricultural land on their property. With approximately 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of agricultural land submerged by floodwaters during the disaster, this would have amounted to a total of approximately Rp48 billion (US$3.4 million); however, some farmers were not able to benefit from this assistance as they did not have the necessary agricultural insurance policy provided by the government.\n\nSee also \n\n Weather of 2019\n Tropical cyclones in 2019\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Oscar–Itseng (2004)—originated in the Australian region and took a similar track to Savannah\nCyclone Cempaka (2017)—a weak tropical cyclone that killed at least 41 people in Java during November 2017\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Ernie (2017)—took a similar track to Savannah\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Kenanga—originated in the Australian region and tracked into the South-West Indian Ocean region\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nAustralian Bureau of Meteorology\nMétéo-France at La Réunion (in French)\nIndonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (in Indonesian)\nJoint Typhoon Warning Center\nOfficial severe weather report on Severe Tropical Cyclone Savannah\n\nTropical cyclones in 2019\n2018–19 Australian region cyclone season\n2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season\nTropical cyclones in Indonesia\nTropical cyclones in Australia\nCategory 4 Australian region cyclones\nIntense Tropical Cyclones\nFloods in Indonesia", "machine_text": " Cyclone Savannah is a tropical cyclone that slammed into the eastern coast of Australia in the late summer of 2019. It caused extensive flooding and damage throughout Queensland and New South Wales, and left a path of destruction along the region’s coastline. The storm first developed near Fiji on February 5th, and travelled out into the Coral Sea where it intensified rapidly. It reached peak intensity on the 10th of February and was classified as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The cyclone made landfall near Hope Island, just north of Surfers Paradise, and brought with it gusts of up to 195km/h and 15cm of rain within a short period of time. The effects of Cyclone Savannah were felt throughout the region, with particular emphasis on areas of low elevation. Numerous structures were damaged, including a local Coast Guard Station and a range of homes. The greater Brisbane region was also affected, with gale-force winds and heavy rains causing flooding in some parts of the city, particularly the bayside suburbs of Manly and Wynnum. In response to the damage caused, the Australian Government and the Queensland State Government both declared a Natural Disaster in the affected areas. This provided access to financial assistance for individuals and businesses who suffered loss from these destructive winds and rains. Whilst Cyclone Savannah was destructive, it wasn’t as powerful as most storms of its kind. Scientists believe that the cooler than normal ocean temperature in the region helped weaken the storm in comparison to ones of similar intensities that have hit the area in the past. Cyclone Savannah was ultimately a destructive force, but it can also be seen as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit. Despite the utter devastation it caused, the residents of the affected area showed untold tenacity and determination in their mission to rebuild the region. The tragedy of Cyclone Savannah will no doubt remain in the memory of those affected for years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60762913}

He attended the University of Toronto where he studied political science and law, graduating in 1973. Following graduation he worked with the Attorney General of Ontario as well as a variety of non-profit organisations. In 1977, O'Beirne entered provincial politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of York Centre. He held this seat until 1981 when he sought election to Parliament and was elected in the riding of Toronto Centre. His win in Toronto Centre was controversial, with some alleging vote fraud. O'Beirne denied the claims and was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. O'Beirne served one term as a Member of Parliament until he was defeated in the 1984 federal election, in part due to his party's (Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives) unpopularity. Despite his defeat, O'Beirne remained active in politics and was appointed to Joe Clark's Cabinet in 1986 as the Minister for Public Works and Supply. In later life, O'Beirne moved to Vancouver and continued to practice as a lawyer. He died in 2014 at the age of 70. O'Beirne was a respected figure in politics, and a firm believer in volunteerism and public service.

The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was an Independent Administrative Institution under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. The agency was formed on October 1st, 1969, and was responsible for Japan's aerospace development and use for peaceful purposes. It also conducted research into space science and technology. NASDA maintained facilities for launch vehicle development, for research and for the manufacture of rockets, satellites and other equipment. Its network of space-related businesses included subcontractors and joint ventures with foreign countries. The agency was responsible for providing shuttle services to the International Space Station. NASDA operated two launch sites, Tanegashima Space Center and Uchinoura Space Center, as well as a satellite tracking station at Noshiro, Akita Prefecture. The agency also owned and managed a number of satellites and other spacecraft. Notably, NASDA was the only Japanese government space organization to have successfully launched a human-rated spacecraft, with the Soyuz F-1 mission in 1994. NASDA was one of Japan's major contributions towards international cooperation in space exploration. The agency initiated a joint venture in the early 1990s called the \"Global Science and Technology Satellite\" (GSTS) which involved international collaboration with five other countries, including the United States and Russia. This project played a significant role in the development of the International Space Station. NASDA also participated in several long-term manned space exploration projects. This included a commitment to the International Space Station in 1998, as well as participation in the Space Shuttle program from 1990 to 1998. In an effort to promote commercialization and utilization of space, NASDA sought to create a public-private partnership that would be viable long-term. To this end, in 2003 the government-backed Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency was established to serve as the successor to NASDA. The new organization was responsible for reintegrating NASDA's main functions, such as launching and managing satellites, controlling ground stations and providing scientific missions in space. NASDA played a unique role in Japan's aerospace industry, pioneering the space industry in the country and facilitating international cooperation in space exploration. NASDA's innovative technologies, research, and launch services greatly contributed to Japan's capabilities in the exploration and utilization of space. The legacy of NASDA's mission and achievements will be remembered for many years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 655458}

The album cover and title are references to the grand dragon Bahamut from the popular role-playing game Final Fantasy. The record contains seven tracks and ranges from classic hard rock reminiscent of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple to more straightforward metal. Specifically, the opening track and first single \"Bullhead\" merges the world of retro and modern. Later tracks like \"Last Lie\" and \"Mantra\" incorporate more progressive elements and psychedelic soundscapes, while tracks like \"Pepar Live Night\" and \"Monument\" are more straightforward rock numbers. The album received strong reviews, with many critics describing it as being more polished and mature than Sahg's previous work. Despite being released on a smaller record label, Bahamut was met with considerable success and became popular on streaming platforms such as Spotify and YouTube. The band, which currently consists of Olav Iversen, Thomas Tofthagen and Thomas Jørgensen, continues to tour and has established a cult following around the world. Bahamut has become an integral part of Sahg's live performances and remains a fan favorite to this day.

The figurines were first discovered in 1970 in the Soviet Union's Gagarino settlement, located on the Don River in the region of Volgograd. Since then, numerous similar figurines have been found in other areas of the world, including Central Europe, Siberia, Middle East and North Africa. The figurines range in size from tiny, palm-sized pieces to ones approximately 12 inches (30 cm) in height. This display of variation has led experts to propose that their purposes may have been numerous, ranging from mere dolls and decorations to icons and worshiped figures. The figurines are mostly of human, typically female form, though some depict animals and abstract shapes. The majority of Venus figurines were carved from stone, such as steatite, calcite, and limestone. In some cases, clay and bones were also used, and a few were crafted out of metal ores. The remains of the Gagarino figures appear to have been worked with tools made of either flint or bone. These tools were commonly used during Paleolithic times, when the Venus figurines are believed to have been carved. These Venus figurines are distinct from the surrounding cultural influences in the area, indicating that they may have been the inspiration for many of the ancient cultures in the region. The presence of the female figurines among the artifacts raises questions about the social roles of women in prehistoric societies and bring about new insights about the beliefs and spiritual lives of the cultures of the time. The Gagarino figurines have been well-preserved and studied, and have provided us with a revitalized understanding of prehistoric cultures. However, there are still many mysteries to be solved about their purpose and makers, though they continue to captivate the imagination and laud archaeological attention.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54352107}

He played professionally as a striker with a number of teams and he is most known for his eight-year spell with Notts County, a club he later managed. He now features as a pundit on weekly football talk show 'Team Talk' on Notts TV.\n\nPlaying career \nMcParland grew up in Tranent, East Lothian and after leaving an apprenticeship with Sunderland due to homesickness worked for two years in the Lothian coal mining industry whilst playing for Ormiston Primrose. McParland was with Notts County from 1980 to 1988, then had spells at Hull City, Walsall, Dunfermline Athletic, Lincoln City, Northampton Town, Instant-Dict (Hong Kong), Eastern AA (Hong Kong), Hamilton Academical and Berwick Rangers.\n\nCoaching and management\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nMcParland eventually went to Nottingham Forest as a coach. He was with Forest for over 10 years and was the reserve team coach for most of that time. When Gary Megson left the club in February 2006, he was put in temporary charge with Frank Barlow in a joint first team management role.\n\nHe and Barlow were named Managers of the Month for March 2006, when they went 10 games unbeaten, with 6 straight wins, including a 7-1 victory over Swindon Town at the City Ground. McParland just missed out on equalling a club record of 7 straight wins when Forest fell to a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Hartlepool United. Despite Forest narrowly missing out on the League One playoffs, McParland was still the favourite to land the Forest job (with Barlow) on a permanent basis. After Colin Calderwood was named the permanent successor to Megson, McParland and Barlow became coaches for the Forest first team.\n\nNotts County\n\nHe was announced as the new Notts County manager in October 2007. McParland enjoyed a two-year spell in charge and, despite the appointment of Sven-Göran Eriksson as Director of Football, the club decided to retain his services. McParland was sacked on 12 October 2009, however, with the club in fifth place in League Two.\n\nIpswich Town\n\nHe joined Ipswich as part of Roy Keane's coaching staff on 27 November 2009.

His second and final game in charge was the home leg of the League Cup semi-final against Arsenal on 12 January 2011, which Ipswich won 1-0. He was replaced permanently by Paul Jewell on 13 January 2011.\n\nSwindon Town\n\nMcParland joined Swindon Town on 3 March 2011 as assistant to Paul Hart who had taken over the manager's role. He left the club in April 2011 following relegation to League Two.\n\nReturn to Forest\n\nOn 28 February 2013, McParland was appointed the under-21 coach at former club Nottingham Forest, returning to the club after an absence of over five years.\n\nManagerial statistics\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Career statistics\n\n1961 births\nLiving people\nFootballers from Edinburgh\nScottish footballers\nNotts County F.C. players\nHull City A.F.C. players\nWalsall F.C. players\nDunfermline Athletic F.C. players\nLincoln City F.C. players\nSliema Wanderers F.C. players\nNorthampton Town F.C. players\nHamilton Academical F.C. players\nBerwick Rangers F.C. players\nDouble Flower FA players\nEastern Sports Club footballers\nScottish Football League players\nEnglish Football League players\nHong Kong First Division League players\nHong Kong League XI representative players\nScottish expatriate footballers\nExpatriate footballers in Hong Kong\nScottish expatriate sportspeople in Hong Kong\nScottish football managers\nNottingham Forest F.C. managers\nNotts County F.C. managers\nIpswich Town F.C. managers\nAssociation football forwards\nIpswich Town F.C. non-playing staff", "machine_text": " Ian McParland (born 17 April 1927) is a retired British football manager and scout, who worked in various domestic and international club management roles from 1976 to 2016.

Founded in 1898 as Decatur Baptist College, Dallas Baptist University currently operates campuses in Dallas, Plano, and Hurst.\n\nHistory\nDecatur Baptist College, the forerunner of Dallas Baptist University, opened its doors in 1898 as the first two-year institution of higher education in Texas.  The Baptist General Convention of Texas purchased the land in 1897 from Northwest Texas Baptist College. The school enjoyed a rich, full history in Decatur until 1965 when it moved to Dallas, at the invitation of the Dallas Baptist Association.\n\nThe school's historic Administration Building in Decatur, built in 1893, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn October 1965, Dallas Baptist College began offering classes for a first class of over 900 students. The initial piece of land for the campus, overlooking Mountain Creek Lake in the hill country of southwest Dallas, were donated by John Stemmons, Roland Pelt, and associates.  An interested group of businessmen donated additional acreage, and in 1994 a donation by the Louis Hexter family brought the current size of the DBU campus, known as University Hill, to . In 2018, an additional land acquisition increased the total campus size to 368 acres.\n\nIn 1968, the college moved from junior-college to senior-college status, offering its first four-year bachelor's degrees in May 1970. In 1985, the college name officially became Dallas Baptist University. The new structure consisted of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, and the College of Business.\n\nGrowth and expansion\n\nIn 2019, the university enrolled 4,487 students. The university offers 84 undergraduate majors, 24 master's degree programs, over 45 dual master's programs, and two doctoral programs. While in its early years, the school had the reputation of being a commuter college, today's DBU has well over 2,000 students living on campus.\n\nIn 1992, the John G. Mahler Student Center, the first new building on the DBU campus in more than 20 years was dedicated. The building is a close replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was the first of many new buildings in the Georgian architectural style on the campus.\n\nIn 2009, the Patty and Bo Pilgrim Chapel was dedicated. The structure is used for various events such as chapel services and concerts, and houses office space for the Graduate School of Ministry along with classrooms and a large multipurpose room. The inspiration for the exterior of the building came from the First Baptist Church in America, located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n In the fall of 2011, the university opened the Joan and Andy Horner Hall. Named after the founders of Premier Designs, Horner Hall houses the DBU communication department, the offices for the College of Fine Arts, a multipurpose classroom and video recording studio, a design lab, and a music business recording studio, designed by the Russ Berger Design Group. The exterior of the structure is modeled after Congress Hall located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2001, DBU-North opened in Carrollton, Texas as DBU's first regional academic center, serving North Dallas and Collin County.  For several years, DBU-North was located in Frisco, Texas, and in 2011, moved to Plano, Texas. DBU also opened DBU-Hurst-Colleyville at Hurst in the Summer of 2005.\n\nIn 2015, Jim and Sally Nation Hall opened its doors. A near replica of Monticello, the building is the home of the Gary Cook School of Leadership, as well as other administrative offices. The building also houses several classrooms as well as a special event space situated in the dome of the building.\n\nFurther locations for special programs and opportunities include the Department of Military Science at University of Texas at Arlington (Army ROTC), Aerospace Studies at Texas Christian University (Air Force ROTC), and the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics in Dallas Texas.\n\nAcademics\n\nAcademic divisions\nThe university is divided into seven colleges: the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, the College of Business, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the College of Professional Studies.

Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen. Jim Mattis. The organization also produces “The Daily Briefing,” an email that goes out three times a week covering the news of the day with a Christian perspective.\n\nRankings and recognition \n U.S. News & World Report ranks Dallas Baptist University, DBU, as 214th among \"National Universities\" in its 2017 edition.\n\nTraditions\nIn its early years, Dallas Baptist University's mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.\n\nCross Ring \nThe Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experience at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.\n\nMr. Patriot\nOne of DBU's longest running tradition, stemming from when DBU's mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant.

The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear), and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title, and has rights to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.\n\nFamily events\nFamily Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus. Notable events include the Family Softball Game, Movie on the Quad, and Art Show as well as a family service project.

It is believed that the first Roman Catholic Church in Dunedin was established at John Street, in 1874. The original St. Matthew’s church was the second church built by the Catholics and was located at the corner of Cumberland and Melville Streets. In 1891, the current St. Matthew’s Church on Hope Street was opened and dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The original building was a temporary wooden chapel, constructed from kauri. It served the Catholic community of Dunedin for more than a decade until it was replaced with a larger church building. In 1905, the current St. Matthew’s Church was designed by the architect Richard J. Creedy. It was built in the Baroque style of architecture, an architectural style which was prominent in the first half of the twentieth century and was highly popular among churches of that era. The building consists of a three-storey bell tower, a red brick facade with a tile roof, and an ornate interior. The interior includes marble flooring, stained glass windows, a statue of St. John the Baptist, and a pipe organ. The church is renowned for its attractive ceiling which was created by the mosaic artists of the Guidlans Workshop in Italy. Outside the church is a carillon, also called “Blessing Bells”, dedicated to the founding Sisters of Mercy. The bells are rung for six days leading up to Sunday, to \"soothe away the cares of the world.\" St. Matthew’s Church and its parish have been incredibly important to the Catholic population of Dunedin since it first opened its doors in 1891.

Fascism, in the Russian context, is not sophisticated or advanced and has no connection to the political philosophy of Russian Traditionalism. Rather, it is a rather primitive and nationalistic belief which promotes ultranationalism, autocracy, and authoritarianism. Russian Fascism largely began in the years following the Russian Revolution of 1917. There were a number of different organizations that emerged in Soviet Russia during this period which embraced Fascism as their main ideology. The most prominent was the National Fascist Party (known as VFP in Russian), which was formed in 1922 and existed until it was banned in 1924. Its leader, Vasilii Shulgin, was an ardent admirer of Benito Mussolini and adopted much of his rhetoric and style. In a broader sense, the word \"fascism\" in Russia is often used to refer to a wide range of far-right ideologies, both those of an enlisted military variety and of an anti-Semitic and anti-foreigner type. Since its disbandment, VFP has gone through various stages of evolution and re-emergence, though with different names and purposes. It was mainly composed of former White Army officers who yearned for a return to the days before the Revolution, and openly declared itself anti-Marxist and committed to restoring Russian empire and monarchism. The most famous Russian Fascist was the dissident writer and political thinker Alexander Dugin, who founded the Eurasian Youth Union in the late 1990s. Dugin is an ardent admirer of Fascist philosopher Julius Evola and incorporates Evola’s spiritual fundamentalism into his doctrine. Dugin has stated that Russian Fascism is the inevitable solution for the current political and spiritual crisis of Russia. In contemporary Russian politics, there are a number of organizations which are classified as Fascist by their opponents, mostly as a means of delegitimization. Such organizations include the Renewal Movement, the Movement against Illegal Immigration, and the Narodnaya Volya Party. Regardless of its various forms and materials, Russian Fascism remains a powerful political ideology and has had a significant influence on recent Russian history and politics. In conclusion, Fascism as a political philosophy originated in Italy and has been adopted by various Russian individuals and organisations throughout the 20th century, and it still remains a powerful political force today. It is an ultra-nationalist and authoritarian movement, and it is characterized by its opposition to Communism, Marxism, and foreign influences. Furthermore, it supports the restoration of Russian empire and the reimplementation of certain traditional values. Generally speaking, although there is no unified and acknowledged definition of Russian Fascism, its core principles and trends remain clear.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2847842}

The Leopard was ordered on 27th April 1788 and built by William Barnett at his shipyard in Deptford. She was launched in May 1790 and commissioned in June of the same year. The ship was made from a design by Sir William Rule and was built to a tonnage of 1043 tons. In 1790 the Leopard set sail for the West Indies under the command of Captain Robert Barlow, where it took part in several anti-smuggling operations. After spending a year in the Caribbean the ship sailed back to England. In November 1793 the Leopard sailed under the command of Captain Henry Digby in an expedition against the French naval bases on the French Coast. The Leopard took part in numerous engagements during the expedition, with notable action being the capture of several French vessels. However, the Leopard soon ran out of supplies and was forced to return to England. In 1798, under the command of Captain William Gordon, the Leopard was sent to the Mediterranean to fight the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the mission, the Leopard captured numerous French vessels and ferried supplies to the Mediterranean theatres. In 1801, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Leopard participated in the blockade of French ports and also took part in patrols to hunt down French vessels. During this period, the Leopard captured several French vessels, including a 36-gun frigate. In 1806 the Leopard was decommissioned and served for a time as a prison ship, before becoming a hospital ship in 1808. In 1812, during the War of 1812, the Leopard was again recommissioned and served as a transport vessel. In 1814 the Leopard was retired and eventually broken up in May that year. The legacy of the Leopard remains in the form of paintings and engravings depicting the ship engaged in action. A painting by Willian Beechey and an etching by John Rose, both showing the Leopard in battle can be found in the National Maritime Museum in London. Today, there are various memorials to the Leopard, including a memorial plaque in Sheerness and a memorial in Deptford. The original launch book of the Leopard is currently on display in the Greenwich Maritime Museum, as a testament to the proud service of the ship and her crew.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1138296}

Nethercutt\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jack Boison Nethercutt (October 11, 1913 – December 6, 2004) was an American entrepreneur and car collector. He was the co-founder of Merle Norman Cosmetics with his aunt Merle Norman, later ascending to the positions of chairman and chief executive officer of the company. He also served as a director of the Personal Care Products Council.\n\nNethercutt used his wealth to assemble one of the world's greatest car collections, which would become known as the Nethercutt Collection. With his cars, he won a record 6 Best of Show titles at the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and is widely considered to the greatest car competitor of all time.\n\nEarly life and education\nNethercutt was born in South Bend, Indiana, United States, to Carl and Florence Nethercutt with two other siblings. At the age of 9, his mother died and he moved to Santa Monica, California in 1923 to live with his aunt, Merle Norman and her husband Andy Norman. He attended Santa Monica High School and later enrolled to study chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. During his time in college, his aunt had created a small local cosmetics business in her home, making formulas out of her own kitchen. He dropped out of college to help her establish the business.\n\nMerle Norman career\nIn 1931, Nethercutt's aunt spent $150 to open a small local cosmetics studio named Merle Norman Cosmetics in downtown Santa Monica to sell their homemade products. Norman created the products and Nethercutt peddled to dealers on his bicycle, picking up disregarded boxes from groceries for packing shipments. By 1934, the company had expanded to 94 independently owned franchises across the contiguous United States, with the majority of them being owned by women. Nethercutt later served as Vice-Chairman of Merle Norman until Norman stepped down in 1963. In 1969, Nethercutt decided to make the previously private family owned enterprise go public on the American Stock Exchange. In 1974, Nethercutt purchased all the public stock back at roughly US$10 million, roughly $55 million adjusted for inflation. Following his purchase, he would again make Merle Norman a privately owned company.\n\nUnder his tenure, Merle Norman was recognized as one of the top 10 largest American cosmetic companies by People magazine. By 1981, Nethercutt spent $5 million on Merle Norman's first nationwide advertising campaign, which had previously only used word-of-mouth marketing. The company also had begun experimentally selling in European markets, specifically Switzerland and Austria, which attained $1 million in the first year. By the end of 1981, Merle Norman as a whole made over US$130 million and had expanded to over 2,700 studios in the US and Canada. In 1993 Nethercutt stepped down as CEO but remained the chairman of the board. In 1999 he directed the refurbishment of all Merle Norman studios in North America for a universal consistent interior design, which was last updated in the late 70s. By 2004, Merle Norman had expanded to eight countries internationally and was consistently in the top 50 of Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500. The company had a revenue of over $100 million and he passed the company down to his son, Jack Nethercutt II.\n\nCosmetic committee positions \nNethercutt served as the President of the California Cosmetics Association. He was on both the board and executive committee of the Personal Care Products Council.\n\nCars\nIn 1956, Nethercutt purchased two cars, a 1936 Duesenberg Convertible Roadster for $5,000 and a 1930 DuPont Town Car for $500, which both needed restoration. He estimated the restoration of the DuPont would take a few weeks, but ended up taking over 18 months and over $65,000. In 1958, his prolonged project to rebuild his DuPont was not in vain and he won Best of Show at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In 1971, Nethercutt purchased a large land lot in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Sylmar. Construction began on a personal 10 story tall building with six floors to house his vehicles and other antique collections, featuring his private penthouse on the top floor. The Nethercutt Collection was built next to a Merle Norman manufacturing plant. \n\nThe first two stories of the tower, the Lower and Grand Salon, feature his vehicle collection of 30 cars on display. The third story features an awards room from concours competitions and collection of hood ornaments. The fourth story consists of a music room with several large antique music boxes and player pianos, with a Wurlitzer theatre organ in the centerpiece of the room. The fourth floor also featured a Louis XV styled dining room with a private chef for his family and friends. The fifth floor has a theatre and a large collection of pianos. The top floor featured his private penthouse. The collection's first four floors are open to the public free of charge with reserved guided tours.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Nethercutt purchased the Twenty Grand, the only 1933 Rollston Arlington Torpedo-bodied Duesenberg SJ and gave it a full original restoration, changing the exterior color from black to a metallic silver and refining the interior. Once the restoration was completed, Nethercutt entered it into Pebble Beach in 1980 and won Best of Show. Because of the car's reputation and beauty, it was exhibited in Essen, Germany as one of The Ten Most Beautiful Cars in the World.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Nethercutt Collection expanded with a 40,000 square foot addition to the tower and a 60,000 square foot new display building directly across the street called the Nethercutt Museum, which is self-guided. Outside of the Museum are his CPR steam locomotive Royal Hudson No. 2839 with a 1912 Pullman private car. By 2004, Nethercutt Collection and Museum included nearly 250 automobiles and led Autoweek to call the Nethercutt Collection one of America's five greatest automobile museums. Jay Leno described Nethercutt's collection as a \"Smithsonian-style effort on the history of transportation in America\" and \"the hall of fame for cars.\" Nethercutt passed the his company and the Collection down to his son Jack with his wife, Helen.\n\nConcours d'Elegance competition\nNethercutt competed in dozens of Concours d'Elegance shows in North America with his cars from the Collection. By 2004, he was one of the most victorious competitors in history and had won several dozen of Best of Show awards, notably including the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance a record six times: 1958, 1959, 1969, 1970, 1980 with The Twenty Grand, and 1992, more than any other individual.\n\nNethercutt is widely considered as one of the greatest car competitors of all time.\n\nPersonal life\n\nNethercutt married his high school sweetheart Dorothy Sykes in 1933. Dorothy was a collector of David Winter sculpted ceramics, including cottages, miniature pianos, and dolls which are featured in the Nethercutt Collection. Their marriage lasted over 70 years and they had two children, Jack and Robert. They later had two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Through Jack and his wife Helen he had three step great-grandchildren, the Richards boys.\n\nEvery year, Nethercutt would take dozens of cars from the Collection with family, friends, and invited guests on a cruise through the hills to a picnic at Frazier Park with catered foods from the professional chefs at the Collection. The event was described as one of the most exclusive items on any car lover's wish list. As Autoweek magazine put it, \"You can be as rich as Bill Gates or have a collection as big as that of the Sultan of Brunei, but you don’t get a personal invitation from J.B. Nethercutt himself.\"\n\nNethercutt loved fishing and was a frequent visitor to the Lake of the Woods near Kenora, Canada. He later purchased a private island on the lake. Nethercutt once diverted his plane to Kenora for a fry feast at Ye Old Chip Truck. In 1985 he donated $1 million to the town for a new emergency department. Later the center and the road connecting it were named in honor after him.\n\nNethercutt was friends with fellow Los Angeles-based car enthusiasts and collectors Jay Leno, Barry Meguiar, and Bruce Meyer.\n\nAircraft \nNethercutt owned several private aircraft through Merle Norman Aviation: a Gulfstream I, Gulfstream II, and a Cessna 206, alongside a small helicopter fleet.\n\nHonors\nThe Nethercutt Emergency Center at the UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica is named after J.B. Nethercutt.\n\nThe J.B. & Dorothy Nethercutt Most Elegant Closed Car Award at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is named in their honor.\n\nDeath\nNethercutt died on December 6, 2004 in Santa Monica.\n\nReferences\n\n1913 births\n2004 deaths\nPeople from South Bend, Indiana\nAmerican company founders\nAmerican car collectors\nCosmetics businesspeople\nAmerican cosmetics businesspeople\nNethercutt-Richards family", "machine_text": " J. B. Nethercutt was an American automotive entrepreneur who co-founded Merle Norman Cosmetics and later established The Nethercutt Collection in Sylmar, California. He is widely credited with being the driving force behind the proliferation of the automobile in the United States. Born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1895, Nethercutt was the son of a wealthy furniture manufacturer. At the age of fourteen he moved to California with his family and became an apprentice at a shoe factory. After his apprenticeship, he worked for the Hines Shoe Company in Los Angeles, where he developed a passion for cars and everything to do with the automobile industry. In 1925, Nethercutt and his childhood friend, Merle Nethercutt Norman, founded their first business; Merle Norman Cosmetics. This business rapidly became a nationwide success and would become one of the most recognized and successful cosmetic businesses in the world. In the late 1950s, Nethercutt decided to start collecting cars. As his collection soon became too large to house, he purchased a building which would become The Nethercutt Collection, the first publicly funded automobile museum. This museum became a unique collection of 19th and early 20th century automobiles, and is one of the largest and most respected private collections of its kind. Nethercutt was a dedicated philanthropist and declared his intention to donate the entire collection to an educational institution in the future. In 1988, after his death, it was announced that the Nethercutt Collection and Foundation would merge with the Smithsonian Institution, ensuring the preservation and accessibility of the museum for future generations. Nethercutt not only preserved the history of the automobile, but also made sure that the industry would continue to thrive and develop. He is remembered for his foresight and dedication to the automotive industry, and his contributions to the cultural and economic growth of Los Angeles.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63744581}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monis Rahman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Monis Rahman is a Pakistani internet entrepreneur, venture capitalist and businessman. Rahman is the co-founder and executive chairman of Naseeb Networks, Inc. a business-oriented social network used primarily for online job recruiting.  Rahman has been listed among the top entrepreneurs of 21st century several times. Forbes named him at #6 on its list of top \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\".\n\nCareer\n\nEarly years\nAfter completing his studies at Wisconsin, Rahman went to work at Intel. With the Intel team, he developed an Itanium microprocessor chip between 1991 and 1996 and left the job after looking at the dot-com bubble rise in order to start his own company. In 1997, Rahman and a partner started a company that installed cameras in daycare centers, allowing parents to watch the video streams online in real time. Edaycare.com attracted $2.5 million from investors, including Ron Conway, an early stage investor of Google and PayPal. A year later Rahman and his partner ran out of money, forcing them to sell the company for stock that was beneficially worthless.\n\nNaseeb Networks, Inc.\nAfter a hiatus of four years and working as a consultant, Rahman decided to start a social networking site for Muslims in the United States and United Kingdom, after looking at the success of similar website Friendster.com. He named it \"Naseeb.com\" (meaning \"destiny\"). Built as a social site, it was considered more of match-making portal, but Rahman said, \"I decided not to go head-on as a matchmaking site... 'Dating' has a negative stigma from a Muslim viewpoint.\" Naseeb.com was then invested in by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman with $25,000, while Mark Pincus of Zynga and Joe Kraus of Excite also stepped in as angel investors.\n\nDescribing the inspiration behind Naseeb, Rahman said, \"I was exploring the Pakistani market since my family had moved here. I realized that the biggest cost in running a web company was of human capital. And the running cost in Pakistan would have been 1/18th of what it would have been in the US. So that's when I decided to come back and start Naseeb.com, which exploded very quickly. We were the first one to be doing any kind of serious business on the internet back then. And we had little to no competition in the market.\"\n\nIn 2002, Rahman returned to Pakistan and registered his company as Naseeb Networks, Inc., both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in San Jose, California, US, to make it easier to raise money and investors. He spent $60,000 as a startup cost for Naseeb and initially handled the company on his own. To prime the market, he used equity in the company to buy the electronic greeting card site eidmubarak.com, which allow Muslims to send cards for Eid, a Muslim holiday. Three thousand people from the site's 1-million-strong mailing list signed up immediately. Annual memberships cost $40, and by 2005 the website was generating $300,000 in revenue.\n\nWith the expansion of company Rahman needed programmers and developers, and buying ads in local newspapers was expensive. He recalls, \"I started Naseeb.com from my house, but later moved out as we grew. Now when hiring, I ran into a lot of problems finding the right talent. At that time, one job ad in the classified section in Dawn News, roughly cost PKR 850,000 which was ridiculous! So I decided to put my ads online.\"\n\nRozee.pk\n \nIn 2005, Rahman built a \"quick and dirty\" job site to post job openings for his parent company Naseeb Networks. Many other companies contacted Rahman to post their companies' and products' ads on his website. Rahman agreed to post their ads free of cost to help boost Naseeb's traffic. After receiving such a reception, the website became the primary business of Naseeb Networks.\n\nRahman then offered the largest companies the ability to search for résumés, as well as software to power their own companys' job boards and the right to post their logos on the front page of his new site. He named it \"Rozee\", an Urdu language word which means \"livelihood\", or translates roughly as \"blessed livelihood.\"\n\nIn 2007 Rozee.pk went into a completely functioning state, generating more traffic than Naseeb. Rahman used Naseeb's proceeds, and $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and ePlanet Ventures, to hire salespeople to go after large corporate clients, most of which still advertised job openings in newspapers. More than 63 000 companies actively post openings on Rozee.pk, paying between $29 for a single ad and up to $20,000 for a suite of services.\n\nRozee.pk has been listed as the number one employment website in Pakistan, with more than 65 thousand companies posting jobs, 32.53 million applications processed and 6 million unique visitors every day. In 2015, Rozee.pk won $6.5 million of investment from Vostok Nafta and Piton Capital, bringing the company's total venture capital funding to $8.5 million.\n\nIn an interview Rahman stated, \"As talent continues to move online at a rapid pace in emerging markets, businesses need increasingly sophisticated recruiting technology customized to nuanced local market dynamics.\"\n\nIt was the latest in a series of large venture capital investments in Pakistan over the previous year and a half. Managing director Per Brilioth said, \"We are excited to partner with Naseeb Networks and impressed with what Rahman and his team have achieved in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia... We believe these markets present massive growth opportunities and are looking forward to working with the team to expand the reach of Naseeb Networks' world-class products and services.\" Michael Porter of AllWorld Network listed the company as one of Pakistan's fastest growing private companies. American writer Elmira Bayrasli visited Pakistan in 2010 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of the country and listed Rahman as an \"example to entrepreneurs\" in her 2015 book, From the Other Side of the World. She claimed that the \"next Silicon Valley could be in Lahore, Mumbai or Istanbul.\"\n\nChalo.pk\nIn 2011, Rahman launched a location-based online shopping portal that features \"local daily deals and listings for the most affordable things to do, place to eat, and brands to buy\" in cities throughout Pakistan. Rahman said, \"Chalo is my experiment. We have hundreds of SMEs in Pakistan who can't afford to promote themselves on large platforms like newspapers, billboards, TV etc. We're helping them expand & grow through Chalo.pk... We're also experimenting with Maps. We spent 2 years building our own maps database, and now we have mapped every single house address in any planned society in Lahore. We’ve also mapped all the restaurants, their menus and other details in the app. So people can navigate to them really easily. If you want to watch a movie, we're listing all the movies being shown in all the cities, and soon we'll be adding a Buy button.\"\n\nDigital Publishers Association of Pakistan\nIn 2012, Rahman co-founded the Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), with several publications and portal owners including Masood Hamid (President), Monis Rahman (Vice President), Sarmad A. Ali (Member Executive Committee), Lucas Peter (Secretary General), Imran Ansari (Joint Secretary), Qudratullah Shahab (Member Executive Committee), and Sarah Sohail (Finance Secretary). The association aims to \"safeguard interests of all stakeholders in the burgeoning digital market and create a regulated playing field.\"\n\nMihnati.com acquisition\nIn 2013, Rozee.pk bought Saudi employment website Mihnati.com for an undisclosed amount. Discussing the acquisition, Rahman said, \"We have merged both Rozee.pk and Mihnati by migrating all Mihnati employers and jobseekers on to the Rozee.pk technology platform. By doing this, we gave our Saudi sales team a far more powerful product to sell with more features.\"\n\nOther works and future ventures\nAfter establishing himself, Rahman served as a head or partner of several technology firms in Pakistan, including as a member of the board of directors at Kashf Microfinance Bank Limited  (2010-2012), and of the Pakistan Advisory Board at Acumen Fund (2010-2013). Currently he is a member of the Young Presidents' Organization (2010) Governing Board (CEC) at Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITES (P@SHA) (2013), Secretary General and founding member at Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), and a member of the Global Board of Trustees (BoT) at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE, Lahore) (2012).\n\nRahman is regarded as one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. Many have listed him in their top ten lists of CEOs and entrepreneurs. In 2016, Rahman was listed among the top CEOs of Pakistan, was placed at No. 6 among the Top 10 Most Influential Tech Leaders of Pakistan, and was ranked at #3 among the \"Top 5 E-commerce Business Tycoons of Pakistan\". Rahman is a TED speaker and is frequently invited to talk on entrepreneurship and Internet marketing at the world's top business schools and conferences.\n\nIn 2016, Rahman together with Qasif Shahid developed a digital mobile wallet to increase digital payments' scale rapidly. The mobile wallet is telco, bank and handset agnostic with the philosophy of inter-operating collaboratively with existing payment plumbing. It is jointly funded by Finca Microfinance Bank and the e-company Finja. In an interview Qasif said, \"We believe banking products should look more like social networks than conventional banking products.\"  Rahman said, \"Our mobile wallet's open API platform will allow much needed collaborative creativity from other FinTechs to be leveraged to create building blocks for a wider array of useful financial products.\"\n\nAwards and honors\n 2008: International Data Group CIO Pakistan Pioneer in Innovation Award\n 2011: Forbes \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\"\n 2012: Pakistan Power 100 Excellence Award\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Rahman's profile at Rozee.pk\n \n Rahman at Naseeb Networks, Inc.\n\nLiving people\nBusinesspeople in computing\nPakistani computer businesspeople\nStanford University alumni\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison alumni\nPakistani expatriates in Saudi Arabia\nPakistani expatriates in the United States\nPakistani venture capitalists\nSilicon Valley people\nPakistani company founders\nBusinesspeople from Lahore\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": " Monis Rahman is an American engineer and entrepreneur, founder of the home automation platform, Verdigris Technologies.

The race is open to any filly or mare, three years old or older, willing to race the 1-1/8 mile (nine furlongs) dirt course. The event carries a purse of $150,000 and is the first leg of the Canadian Triple Tiara. The race was inaugurated in 1996 and was named in honor of Ballerina, a Canadian Hall of Fame racehorse owned and raced by E.P. Taylor. Taylor also owned Woodbine Racetrack, where the race is run. The Ballerina Stakes is the first leg of the Canadian Triple Tiara, a series of three stakes races which together make up the Canadian Racing Triple Crown. The series consists of the Ballerina Stakes, the Prince of Wales Stakes and the Breeders' Stakes. In order to be victorious in the Triple Tiara, a horse must win all three races. The Ballerina Stakes record time is 1:45.00 set in 2002 by Eternal Search. The record time for the mile and an eighth is 2:01 .08 set by Dream Fair in 1996. The most successful horse in the history of the race is Danzig's Beauty, who won the race three times in a row from 2000 to 2002. Several notable horses have won the Ballerina Stakes, including Local Resident (1997), Victory Ride (1998), Dreamfair Eternal (1999 and 2002), Oaks of Aragon (2000), Balletto (2003), Sealy Hill (2007), and La Sardane (2014). The most successful jockey in the history of the race is Pat Day who won three Ballerina Stakes between 1997 and 2001. The Ballerina Stakes has been both a prep race for the Breeders' Stakes and a test for time-limited betting events such as the Queen's Plate, the first leg of Canada's Triple Crown. The Ballerina Stakes is also referred to informally as the \"Ballerina Handicap,\" or just \"The Ballerina.\" The event is part of the Woodbine race card on a traditional holiday Victoria Day, the Monday preceding May 25th. Despite their close proximity in date, the Victoria Day card features the Ballerina Stakes while the actual Canadian Triple Tiara series only consists of the Prince of Wales Stakes and the Breeder's Stakes.

The song was co-written by the singer herself and composer Marcello Azevedo, who has written other songs for several Latin artists including Chayanne, Jennifer Lopez and Paulina Rubio. The ballad recounts the story of a woman in love, describing her tumultuous relationship with her partner. She expresses her hope for a better life, asking for guidance from a higher power as she makes decisions regarding her relationship. The singer showed her melancholy side with this song and the accompanying music video features her singing in front of a moonlit window, surrounded by her memories of her former love. The song was released as the second single from the album and it was well-received. In Mexico and some Latin American countries, the single reached the top spots on the music charts; some of them such as Peru and Venezuela certified the song Gold for sales and airplay. In Mexico, Niña de mi Corazón topped the 40 Principales chart, and charted in France, where it peaked at #19, becoming Thalía’s third and last chart entry in the country. The song won the Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year in 2000 and it was nominated for an International Viewer’s Choice Award at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards Latin America.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pornographic film\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pornographic films (pornos), erotic films, or sex films are films that present sexually explicit subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy the viewer. Pornographic films present sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity (softcore) and sexual intercourse (hardcore). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality, and focuses more on arousal than storytelling; the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional film stock in various formats, home video, DVDs, Internet download, cable TV, in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing adult theaters. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on free-to-air television.\n\nFilms with risqué content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of producers began to specialize in their production. Various groups within society considered such depictions immoral, labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, and could only be distributed by underground channels. Because the viewing of such films carried a social stigma, they were viewed at brothels, adult movie theaters, stag parties, at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nIn the 1970s, during the Golden Age of Porn, pornographic films were semi-legitimized; by the 1980s, pornography on home video achieved wider distribution. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s changed the way pornographic films are distributed, complicating censorship regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\nClassification\n\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either softcore or hardcore pornography. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or extreme fetishism. It generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration. A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.\n\nPornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the sexual fantasy which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the market to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain conventions, and each may appeal to a particular audience.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years: 20th century\n\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eugène Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \"Léar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film  had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.\n\nAlso in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance was released as a short nickelodeon kinetoscope/film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risque films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. Perhaps in defiance and \"to spice up a film\", this was followed by many kiss imitators, including The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) and The Kiss (1900). A tableau vivant style was used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.\n\nIn Austria, cinemas organised men-only theatre nights (called ) at which adult films were shown. Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the Pathé brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find, though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female nudity in film.\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In Black and White and Blue (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's Film Facts, \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is \" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian , whose original title could have been  (The Satyr), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film  (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration.\"\n\n1920s–1940s suppression\nPornographic movies were widespread in the silent movie era of the 1920s, and were often shown in brothels. Soon illegal, stag films, or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.\n\n1950s: home movies \nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the 8 mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, Harrison Marks produced films which were considered risqué, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.\n\n1960s: Europe and United States\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, Lasse Braun was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute hardcore movies which he sold to Reuben Sturman, who distributed them to 60,000 American peep show booths. Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director Doris Wishman began producing a series of eight pornographic films, or nudist films without sex scenes, including Hideout in the Sun (1960), Nude on the Moon (1961) and Diary of a Nudist (1961). She also produced a series of sexploitation films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated sexual intercourse. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid penis. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in Massachusetts allegedly for being pornographic. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene, paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film Language of Love (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex educational film, which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, Denmark became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the Netherlands, also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, child pornography and bestiality porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.\n\nIn the United States, producers of pornographic films formed the Adult Film Association of America in 1969, after the release of Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to fight against censorship, and to defend the industry against obscenity charges.\n\n1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States \nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. Mainstream theatres did normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of adult theaters in the United States and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in sex shops that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as Bordellet (1972), the Bedside-films (1970–1976) and the Zodiac-films (1973–1978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early Bedside-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history and all remain favourites on home video.\n\nIn 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film was a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was made.\n\nThe first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be Mona the Virgin Nymph (also known as Mona), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco, who created the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) 1974 cult film Flesh Gordon and later, in 1976, the X-rated musical-comedy film Alice in Wonderland.\n\nThe 1971 film Boys in the Sand represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, The Boys in the Band), and, after the 1969 film Blue Movie, one of the first to be reviewed by The New York Times. Other notable American hardcore feature films of the 1970s include Deep Throat (1972), Behind the Green Door (1972), The Devil in Miss Jones (1973), Radley Metzger's The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976) and Debbie Does Dallas (1978). These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. William Rotsler expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision. Nothing can stop this.\" In Britain, Deep Throat was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.\n\nThe U.S. was Miller v. California was an important court case in 1973. The case established that obscenity was not legally protected, but the case also established the Miller test, a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to indecency (which may or may not be legal).\n\n1980s: new technology and new legal cases\nWith the arrival of the home video cassette recorder in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like Traci Lords, Seka, Christy Canyon, Ginger Lynn, Nina Hartley, and directors such as Gregory Dark. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. Those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This marked the end of the age of big-budget productions, and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos. One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the camcorder spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe de facto result of the 1987 legal case California v. Freeman effectively legalized hardcore pornography in the U.S.. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.\n\n1990s: DVD and the Internet age\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format (videotape) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos were ordered from an adult bookstore or through mail-order; with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including paysites, video hosting services and peer-to-peer file sharing. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991, as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time, led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\nViv Thomas, Paul Thomas, Andrew Blake, Antonio Adamo, and Rocco Siffredi were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the Danish, Oscar-nominated film production company Zentropa became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce hardcore pornographic films, starting with Constance (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced Idioterne (1998), directed by Lars von Trier, which won many international awards and was nominated for a Golden Palm in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). Idioterne started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance, which starred pornstar Rocco Siffredi.\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel Kanal København started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the Copenhagen area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of Innocent Pictures, a company started by Zentropa).\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. The Internet served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. The market was further expanded by webcams and webcam recordings, in which thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n2000s: competition and contraction\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size. At the same time this gave rise to video sharing platforms such as Pornhub, YouPorn and XHamster.\n\nPornographic film industry\n\nEconomics\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion which includes the production of various media and associated products and services. The industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. According to a 2005 Reuters article, \"The multi-billion-dollar industry releases about 11,000 titles on DVD each year.\" Pornographic films can be sold or rented out on DVD, shown through Internet and special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite, and in adult theaters. However, by 2012, widespread availability of illegally copied content and other low-cost competition on the Internet had made the pornographic film industry smaller and reduced profitability.\n\nThe global pornographic film industry is dominated by the United States, with the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles being the heart of the industry.\n\nIn 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the United States was estimated at $5–10 million. The 1979, Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that \"in Los Angeles alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume.\" According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.\n\n the total current income of the country's adult entertainment is often estimated at $10–13 billion, of which $4–6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998. In 2007 The Observer newspaper also gave a figure of $13 billion. Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, websites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6–3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). USA Today claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni's Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time. The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3 billion but the figure obtaining is unclear. According to the 2001 Forbes data, the annual income distribution is the following:\n\nThe Online Journalism Review, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored Forbes number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate—hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.\n\nThe world's largest adult movie studio Vivid Entertainment generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually, and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. The Spanish-based studio Private Media Group was listed on the NASDAQ until November 2011. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to a half-billion by 1993. Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation's DirecTV. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.\n\nProduction\n\nPornographic films are produced and directed at the target audience, who buy and view the films. Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the sexualization of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of feminist pornography.\"'Artisanal, locally grown, free range porn for women\" Nagy, Toni. Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013 In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of physical attractiveness.\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\nLegal status\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid. Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of People v. Freeman. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely portraying a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.But see news.com.au: Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows February 08, 2010\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\" The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\nAn offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines. Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States is personal possession in the home (Stanley v. Georgia).\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in Miller v. California that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the Muslim world and China, but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n Health issues \nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of condoms, with an accompanying risk of sexually transmitted disease among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of HIV infection which led to the deaths through AIDS of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days. , HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades. The AIM closed its doors in May 2011 and filed for bankruptcy as a result of a court case arising from an inadvertent leak by it of confidential information on clients, including names and STD results.\n\nTerminology\n\n Compilation – a release based on highlights from other adult films or video, unused footage, or that feature a particular genre\n Mature – used to refer to performers in or of the genre referred to as MILF porn\n Raincoat – a term used to refer to a condom\n Other terms synonymous with pornography:\nPorn or porno\nAdult film\nBlue movie\nStag film\nSkin flick\n\nSee also\n\n List of pornographic film awards\n Adult theater\n Amateur pornography\n Cartoon pornography\n Cum shot\n List of pornographic film studios\n Pornography addiction \n Porn groove\n Porn parody\n Pornography by region\n STDs in the porn industry\n Unsimulated sex\n X-rated\n\nReferencesNotesBibliography'''\n Patrick Robertson: Film Facts'', 2001, Billboard Books,\n\nExternal links\n \n\n Films\n \nFilm genres", "machine_text": " Pornographic film, or adult film, is a genre of film that deals primarily with explicit sexual subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy an audience. Pornographic films were originally shot on film stock, but now they are made more commonly by video. In the United States, adult films are regulated by the Motion Picture Association of America. Most pornographic films must be classified as either softcore or hardcore as certain moral restrictions apply. Softcore films generally focus on nudity and other potentially suggestive sexual behavior, while hardcore films typically contain depictions of sexual intercourse and more explicit sexual activity. Many pornographic films focus on particular fetishes, such as bondage and discipline, spanking, and domination and submission, or activities such as lap dancing and mud wrestling. Others involve scenarios such as simulated rape. Documentary-style films have also been made about adult film stars, like the 2010 film Aroused. Pornography has often been subject to censorship and legal restrictions, both for moral and political reasons. In the US, obscenity laws have been used to suppress or restrict the sale or distribution of adult films since the 1960s. In recent decades, such restrictions have been relaxed, but adult films continue to be subject to varying degrees of censorship and control in some countries. Adult films are typically either rented or bought in the form of videotapes, DVDs, video discs, and online streaming. Movie theaters typically do not show adult films, though some exceptions to this rule do exist. In some countries, pornographic films are banned entirely. Pornographic films, while legally restricted, have been used for a variety of educational, therapeutic, and artistic purposes. The nudity and sex scenes in some movies can be used to portray situations in which conventional sexual taboos are challenged or subverted. In addition, sexually explicit artworks, such as the pornographic illustrations of Pompeii, have been preserved and continually inspires new generations of filmmakers.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 238253}

It borders Sebuyau and Samarahan and lies approximately  east-south-east of the state capital Kuching.\n\nMost of its inhabitants are made up of the Malay and the Iban people.\n\nEtymology\nThere are a few deviations regarding the origin of Simunjan name.  The first being when a Chinese merchant went to dry tobaccos during cloudy weather.  Based on this folklore, a Chinese merchant came to Simunjan on a boat known as Wangkang (Djong (ship)) to rest.  While at Simunjan, he tried to dry his tobaccos in the sun, but the weather was cloudy.  The local told them that his \"Jan\" (\"tobacco\" in Chinese) will be \"Semun\" (or \"damp\"); \"Semunlah jan kau kelak\" (\"Your tobacco will get damp.\")  Since this encounter, the place have been known as \"Simunjan.\"\n\nAnother oral tradition speaks of Simunjan coming from the word \"Semun\" and \"Hujan\" (or \"rain\".)  In this version, Simunjan people originated from an area known as \"Ensengei\" that migrated to Simunjan.  Most of them worked as miners.  While trying to start a match, the match was damp due to the frequent rainfall.  Because this area was still unnamed, people combined \"Semun\" and \"Hujan\" to refer this place, hence \"Simunjan.\"\n\nBased on another source, Simunjan got its name from \"Burung Munjan\" (\"Munjan Bird.\")  Burung Munjan was to believe a bird native to Simunjan that was abundant within Gunung Ngeli forest.  Simunjan derived from the phrase \"Si Munjan\" (or \"The Munjan\") hence its name.  However, there are little resources that elaborate further regarding this version, except for a few mentions from locals.  A statue of Burung Munjan was erected around 1990, at Padang Sentral (Central Park) before was moved to Majlis Daerah Simunjan.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Data Tutashkhia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Data Tutashkhia () is a novel written by Chabua Amirejibi in 1975. It was translated to English by Antonina W. Bouis in 1985. This is one of the most popular readable novels in Georgia and former Soviet countries. The character is often compared to the English folklore hero Robin Hood .\n\nAbout novel \nThe novel is a story of a Georgian outlaw of the Imperial Russian period, a very popular theme in Georgian literature, and combines thrilling escapades with Dostoevskian dealings with the fate of an individual and national soul. The story is narrated by a Russian gendarme, Count Szeged, who frequently passes the story-telling on to other characters. The novel follows the life of outlaw Data Tutashkhia, who spends years eluding capture by the Tsarist police. They are led by Data's cousin, his detached and imperturbable double, Mushni Zarandia. The book, and the feature film based on it, turned Data Tutaskhia into an iconic hero, widely popular in Georgia.\n\nPlot and structure \nThe novel is divided into four parts chronicling its hero's, Data Tutashkhia's, moral evolution, always narrated from the perspective of a multitude of characters from  Tutashkhia's past. He is a man who from birth, can not stand injustice and wrongdoing. At the very beginning of the novel, we learn that he was convicted of an accidental killing that even the victim absolved him of! This then began his life as a fugitive, constantly running from police desperate to catch him. Throughout the novel, He goes from place to place, sees evil and struggles with how to overcome it. In the first part of the novel,  Tutashkhia attempts to help those wronged with little result, as either the individual wronged (strangely enough) continues to allow him/herself to be wronged (as in the case of the loser at cards continuing to allow himself to be cheated by card sharks); or the injured and insulted, once rescued by Data, start, themselves, to injure and insult (as was the case with the married pair whom  Tutashkhia assisted to purchase a cow). An excellent, memorable tale in this section of the novel was that of the hospital patients, whom he likened to the cannibal rats bred by one of the residents. \n\nIn the second part of the novel Data Tutashkhia, saddened by his previous experiences, decides not to intervene at all in societal issues unless absolutely certain that his actions would bring good. His new stance had the result of people forgetting all of his past good deeds, and turning on him for his 'indifference'. \n\nIn the third part of the novel, Tutashkhia, who has by this point lost his way, attempts to mingle in society in order to determine for himself a meaning and way forward in life. He joins the company of a lawyer and a mysterious woman and their little group engages in various philosophical debates over drinks (which it seems was/is a national pastime in Georgia!). This portion of the story was both interesting, in terms of the philosophical debates, and suspenseful The segment's climax, the dinner at the lawyer's home (with its 'mystery' guest), was particularly suspenseful and well written.\n\nIn the next section of the novel, Data Tutashkhia decides that evil can only be overcome by force. Here, we learn more about his cousin, who by this time, is one of the Russian imperial gendarme's 'best and brightest'. Completely -ahem- 'devoted' to his job and - ahem- ahem- 'unbiased', he zealously oversees a program to rid the region of 'dangerous' outlaws such as his cousin. It is in this section that we truly gain an understanding of which of the brothers really is the danger to society and the regime.\n\nIn the final part of the book,  Tutashkhia finally decides for himself, based on all of his past experiences, that the best way to rid the world of evil is to do good. This section of the novel features a gripping ending, as well as the final confrontation between Data and his family.\n\nExternal links \nNovel on Amazon.com\nNovel's review\nNovel on goodreads.com\n\nReferences \n\n1975 novels\nGeorgian-language works\nNovels by Chabua Amirejibi\nGeorgian novels\nHistorical novels\nPhilosophical novels", "machine_text": " Data Tutashkhia (alternatively spelled Tutashkhiya) (1888–1959) was a Georgian literary figure, literary critic, researcher and translator. He was educated at the universities of Tbilisi, Kazan and St. Petersburg. He wrote in various genres, including poetry and drama, and edited the journal 'Ganatleba' (Harvest). Tutashkhia was born in the small village of Abastumani near Kutaisi in 1888. His parents hailed from the same region, and he received his basic education there. After graduating from the Tbilisi Seminary, he entered Kazan University and studied there from 1909 to 1912. He then went to St. Petersburg and enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine of the University. During this time, he actively participated in the literary life of the St. Petersburg modernists, and some of his works were published in the journal 'Veche' (The Gathering). In 1918, Tutashkhia returned to Georgia and began what would become his most significant work: the collection and publication of folklore from various regions of Georgia. Between 1920 and 1923 he traveled widely in the Western regions of Georgia, especially Abkhazia, Imereti, Kakheti and Guria. As a result, a collection of folklore was published in 1923 by the Georgian Writers’ Union. Tutashkhia was also a contributor to a variety of Georgian journals and translated several works from foreign languages, including German, Russian and English. He was an active member of the Georgian Academy of Sciences and held the position of professor of Georgian literature at Tbilisi State University. He also wrote several monographs, including \"The Basic Principles of Literary Theory\" (1937), \"Questions of Folklore\" (1938) and \"Questions of National Literature\" (1940). In addition, he participated in the publication of the works of classical Georgian authors, as well as writing and editing literary criticism articles. In 1959, Data Tutashkhia died in Tbilisi. He was an important figure in the Georgian literary world and left behind an impressive list of works, including over 25 books and articles on literature, folklore and culture.

She grew up in a time when African Americans in the South were not allowed the opportunity of a higher education. But she was determined to gain an education. Her father told her \"no one can take away from you what’s in your head.”\n\nKaiser earned a bachelor's degree in education from Pittsburg State University in 1941. Later, she earned a master's degree from Columbia University. She also studied at Chicago University, Rockhurst University, and Dartmouth College. She also undertook special training in radio and TV network, retailing and merchandising in fashions.\n\nCareer\nKaiser taught home economics for more than 20 years in public schools. In 1957, she founded Inez Kaiser & Associates, which was both the first public relations firm led by an African-American woman and the first business owned by an African American to open in Kansas City. By the early 1960s, after securing 7 Up and other big accounts, she had become the first African-American woman to run a public relations firm with national clients. She was the first African-American woman to join the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and the Public Relations Society of America, the profession's trade association.\n\nWriting career\nKaiser began writing a column, \"Fashion Wise and Otherwise\", as a hobby, but she became so interested in helping other African-American women that she devoted several years to contacting publishers across the country, as well as promoting the use of pictures of models of color, giving them employment in areas where they had never been considered before. She wrote a column in The Kansas City Star titled \"As I See It\".\n\nKaiser also wrote a cookbook titled Soul Food Cookery, which was published in 1960.\n\nPolitical views\nKaiser was a life-long Republican, and she advised the Nixon and Ford administrations on issues related to minority women and business.

Born in St. Joseph, Missouri to Jewish immigrants, Kaiser moved to Kansas City in 1898. Although largely self-taught, she was a musical prodigy and began performing in public by the age of 11, forming her own orchestra at age 13. She was offered a scholarship to study music in Chicago, but her family could not afford for her to attend. In 1923, Kaiser moved to New York City and began recording soundtracks for silent films. She continued producing soundtracks for several years before turning to composing popular music. Her most successful period was the late 1930s to early 1950s, working with the likes of Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, and Billie Holiday. Her songs were often used as a backdrop for Lindy hop dances and found success on the charts. Kaiser's compositions often featured complex and unique arrangements, indicating her intention use of jazz and swing as musical inspirations. Many of her compositions showcased racial integration, something rarely seen in popular music in that period. Kaiser was a prominent member of the Darktown Strutters Society, a secret organisation of African American and Jewish musicians in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. Kaiser continued to work as a producer, arranger, and pianist well into the 1950s, releasing her final recording, \"The Anniversary Waltz\", in 1957 alongside Herb Jeffries. She passed away in 1969 in New York City. In 2018, she was posthumously inducted into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame. Today, Kaiser's contribution to early jazz and swing music of the mid 20th century is celebrated by fans and music historians. Her unique sound, championed by both African American and Jewish musicians alike, showcases her genuine passion for creating music and supporting racial integration.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48451509}

This vote benefited Meyer's full-time employer, ConocoPhillips. (Membership in the Alaska state legislature is not a full-time position, and Meyer, like many of his fellow members, maintain full-time employment elsewhere, taking leave when the legislature is in session.) When the bill came to the Senate floor, Meyer asked to be recused from voting. Under legislative rules, however, a member of the legislature must vote if any other members object, and several did.\n\nIn 2015, Meyer announced he had offered a contract for communications consulting to McHugh Pierre.  Pierre formerly served as the civilian second in command for the Alaska State Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, but was forced to resign in 2014 after investigation revealed he had exerted inappropriate and undue influence to derail an investigation of a high school friend of his then serving in the National Guard and suspected of sexually assaulting another member of the Alaska National Guard.  Investigation also revealed Pierre attempted to coerce whistle-blowers into signing non-disclosure agreements prohibiting them from speaking to the media or outsiders about ongoing problems with multiple sexual assaults and other misconduct in the Alaska National Guard.  Meyer described the allegations against Pierre, including those contained in the report prepared by the National Guard Bureau's Office of Complex Investigations as \"hearsay.\"\n\nIn 2020, Meyer decided to mail absentee ballot applications to voters 65 and older, but not to younger voters.

She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. Jisha was a Hindu woman belonging to the scheduled caste. She was living with her mother, who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, who had separated from the family, lived alone and was found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police were puzzled in the initial stages of the investigation, due to the mother's paranoia and the family's lack of relationships with neighbors or relatives. This affected the case's progress initially, among other factors.\n\nMurder\nThe police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Alappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death.\nAccording to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching.  Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.\n\nCase impact\nThe crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.\n\nArrest of murderer\nThrough continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A man hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.\n\nSentencing and aftermath\nAdvocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for the accused Ameer ul Islam in the Jisha murder case. Advocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) hails from Aloor, a place in the Thrissur district in the Kerala state of India. He has also appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for Govindachamy, the man who was accused of murdering a woman traveling in a train in 2011 in Thrissur.For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence.\n\nThe case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner. The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court, in December 2017, awarded death penalty to Ameer ul-Islam, the sole accused in the case. He was also awarded life term, and rigorous imprisonment of 10 and 7 years.\n\nReferences\n\n2016 crimes in India\nRape in India\nStalking\nMay 2016 crimes in Asia\nMurder in India\n2016 murders in Asia\n2010s murders in India\nDeaths by stabbing in India", "machine_text": " The Jisha murder case (or Perumbavoor rape and murder case) was an incident of rape and murder which occurred on 28 April 2016 in Perumbavoor, Kerala, India. The victim, Jisha, was a 30-year-old law student from the lower-middle class Dalit colony of Guruvayurappan Lane in Perumbavoor. The gruesome nature of the crime, the suspect remaining on the loose for almost two months and social activists alleging police inaction over the case brought it to the attention of the public and the media. At 5 pm on 28 April 2016, Jisha's mutilated body was found by her mother in the house. The postmortem reportedly showed that the victim had been brutally attacked and raped, and died from injuries to the head, chest and abdomen. Based on circumstantial evidence from the crime scene, a team of experts from the Kerala Police arrested a 24-year-old man named Ameerul Islam from Assam on 21 June 2016 in connection with the crime.Islam was an ex-convict who had been released after serving a jail term in Karnataka for theft. The case had been closely monitored by the High Court of Kerala which also directed that the case be tried as a fast-track court case, and on 18 February 2017, the Fast Track Court in Ernakulam imposed the death sentence on Islam after finding him guilty of rape and murder. He was also convicted of criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and destruction of evidence, which were all 'heinous, revolting, and despicable' according to the judgment. The incident has been the cause of a great outcry for justice for the Dalit communities in Kerala, especially after reports emerged that the police initially failed to investigate the case to their full extent. Subsequently, the Kerala government set up a commission of Inquiry to investigate the lapses on the part of the police as well as to report on whether there was an attempt to falsely implicate anyone in the case. The Jisha rape and murder case has been an eye-opener for the state of Kerala, with many criticizing the lack of provision for the safety and security of the marginalized. In response, the police department started a number of initiatives such as setting up special tehshildar offices and special nodal officers in all districts, along with a 24-hour helpline and a toll-free helpline. The Kerala government also announced a ₹10 lakh compensation package to the victim's family and allocated ₹50 lakh towards the construction of a house in the victim's name. An additional ₹2 lakh was also announced to the family after the court found the accused guilty. The Prime Minister's National Relief Fund was later utilized to provide a compensation of ₹3 lakh to the family. The incident was the first of its kind, raising alarming concerns about the safety of women and other marginalised groups in India. It raised the demand for proper and prompt monitoring, investigation and proper justice for the victim from all levels of society. With its strong message, the case brought to light the various issues of discrimination and violence towards women and other disempowered groups. The Jisha case has brought about a change in the standard of Indian investigation and legal system, and has paved the way for stringent punishments for heinous crimes. As a result of the case, several state and central governments began to extend more funds and resources towards the protection and security of women. In the future, proactive steps should be taken in order to protect and empower marginalized communities, in line with the principle of social justice.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50480156}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 10 and 11 October 1922, and elected 78 members of the First Seimas of Lithuania. This was the first election held in Lithuania under the democratic 1922 Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania on 1 August 1922.\n\n38 out of 78 seats were won by a bloc of parties led by the Christian Democrats, and they acquired both the positions of President and Prime Minister, occupied by Aleksandras Stulginskis and Ernestas Galvanauskas respectively. In both cases, however, the Christian Democrats were not supported by any party in the opposition and could only form a minority government. Unable to work with such a makeup, the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nElectoral system\nThe law on the conduct of Seimas elections was promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on 19 July 1922, and published in the official newspaper of the government, \"Vyriausybės žinios\" (Government News) on 27 July 1922. Elections were universal, free and secret, and all citizens of Lithuania, both men and women over 21 years old, were allowed to vote. Citizens 24 years old or older were allowed to stand for election.\n\nThe elections were held with party-list proportional representation, in nine multi-member constituencies. In practice, only six of the nine defined constituencies held elections, as Constituencies VII, VIII and IX were allocated to territories occupied by Poland during the Polish–Lithuanian War in 1920. Their centers were Vilnius, Lida and Hrodna respectively.\n\nParties and electoral groups (kuopa) were allowed to submit lists of candidates to constituencies, which had to be signed by at least fifty voters. As such, there was a large number of small electoral lists in every constituency. However, the method of calculating the distribution of seats in each constituency benefited larger parties, as such, the only non-party electoral group which managed to gain seats were lists submitted by the underground Communist Party of Lithuania.\n\nCompeting parties\nThe largest and most active electoral alliance in the election was the Christian Democratic Bloc, formed from the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and two satellite organizations - Labour Federation, which represented Catholic workers, and Farmers' Association, which represented Catholic peasantry. The Christian Democratic Bloc was strongly supported by the Lithuanian priesthood, which had a strong influence in the agrarian and less literate countryside, and numerous priests were a part of their electoral lists.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats were isolated in the political arena. Historically, LKDP evolved from a different stream of the Lithuanian National Revival than all of their competitors - the Peasant Union, Social Democrats and Party of National Progress (later the Lithuanian Nationalist Union). All of them evolved from the secular nationalist newspaper Varpas, while the Christian Democrats evolved around the Catholic periodical Tėvynės sargas.\n\nThe alliance of the Peasant Union and Popular Socialist Party presented itself as socialist and campaigned for the lifting of martial law and secularization. Though the main targets of the criticism were Christian Democrats and National Progress, they were also in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats presented their electoral campaign as the first step towards a peaceful socialist revolution and campaigned for a \"Seimas of the workers\". All political parties supported the land reforms put in place by the Constituent Assembly, and oftentimes argued that their competitors will be the ones to roll back the reform.\n\nSeparate electoral lists by the Polish, Jewish and Russian minorities also competed in the election.\n\nResults\n\nAftermath\nThough the Christian Democratic Bloc achieved a plurality of the seats, they were unable to form a majority coalition, nor did the opposition parties manage to unite against them. The next President and Prime Minister were thus elected via violations of electoral conduct. Protesting against the Christian Democrats, the opposition parties refused to participate in the election of Aleksandras Stulginskis and he was elected solely with Christian Democratic votes. Two governments led by independent politician Ernestas Galvanauskas were formed, but in both cases they were approved with 38 votes in favor and 38 votes against (2 members of the Seimas did not participate), which the opposition criticized as illegal.\n\nThe formed government was unstable and the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary election\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary elections in Lithuania", "machine_text": " The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election was the first election held in the newly independent Lithuania as part of the First Seimas. It was held on February 23, 1922 and was contested by 153 candidates from 21 electoral lists. The election was considered to be largely fair and democratic and was seen as a symbolic start to Lithuania's new-found independence. The election was called following the new Lithuanian National Council's decree of December 21st, 1921, which called for the nation to create a Seimas (Parliament) with a 151-member legislative body. Candidates could run singly or on lists and had to have a minimum of 500 supporters to qualify. All citizens of Lithuania had voting rights, irrespective of their class, religion, or gender. This election saw a large increase in the participation of women, with the number of female candidates increasing from just one in 1920 to 47 in the 1922 election. The women's list, called Žaliūkės (Little Greens), was created in response to fears of a return to pre-war conditions and won five seats. This made it the third-largest list in the election and the first women's party to gain representation in Lithuania's Seimas. The election itself was contested primarily between two main lists: the conservative Peasant Union and the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. The Peasant Union won the most seats (49), while the Social Democrats took 38 seats. The Lithuanian Christian Democrats, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, won 25 seats, while the Polish Christian Democrats and Žaliūkės won 5 seats each. The newly elected Seimas convened for the first time on May 17, 1922, however, the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union soon dissolved due to disagreements about the country's rural- urban balance of power. Later in the same year, the Peasant Union dissolved as well due to disagreements about agrarian reform. The Social Democrats and Žaliūkės fared better, with the former becoming the largest parliamentary group and the latter being a significant player in politics until the 1930s. The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election was a major victory for democracy in Lithuania. It was the first time that the newly independent state had held a free and fair election, and it opened the door for future elections, which became more democratic as time went on. It was a major milestone in Lithuania's newfound independence, and has helped Lithuania become the democratic nation it is today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34401990}

The first vessel of the Sitakund Fisheries Private Limited was the MV Sitakund, which is a diesel driven trawler with a length of 56 metres, a width of 10 metres and a capacity of 500 metric tons of fish. In 2001, the company acquired the MT Sitakund, a much bigger vessel with a length of 80 metres and a capacity of 1,500 metric tons of fish. The vessel was designed and built by the renowned British shipbuilding firm of John I. Thornycroft & Company in 1964. The MT Sitakund is powered by two diesel engines of 400 horsepower each, supplied by the Albanian company Shkoder Diesel. The trawler can be seen in coastal and offshore waters of the Bay of Bengal catching fish in the depths ranging from 20 metres to 200 metres. It is equipped with advanced fishing equipment, such as underwater cameras and lights, which enables the crew to have a better view and understanding of the fish species in the deep sea. The trawler also has multiple power block winches and trawls, aiding the crew in their fishing expeditions. The vessel has an experienced and dedicated crew of 40 people, who are mainly fishermen from the coastal villages of Bangladesh. The crew consists of fishermen, engine men, technicians, deckhands, and navigation officers, all of who are highly experienced in their respective fields. The MT Sitakund is an important part of the fishing industry of Bangladesh, as it contributes significantly to the country’s fishing and seafood export industry. The trawler supplies fish and other seafoods to markets and customers around the world, furthering the economic all-round benefit of the nation.

It aired in the United States on Fox on November 3, 2019.

Bart, Lisa, and Groundskeeper Willie go back to the water park to free the whale trapped in it, with Bart finally understanding altruism and liking it. Homer takes the family on a ride on his boat called the 'Something's Fishy' and even Marge agrees it was a good idea to buy it.\n\nThe next rider on the boat is Grampa. But when they return to the pier, the boat starts sinking and Raphael offers his help as a mechanic while Bart is sharing a plan with Milhouse to free other animals in his newfound spirit of altruism.\n\nHomer offers Lenny and Carl to share the boat, and the expenses to fix it. Bart and Milhouse go to the Springfield Zoo and free a gorilla named Lolo, but he goes on a rampage while Milhouse narrowly escapes getting eaten by two tigers.\n\nBart calls Lisa for help since the police are useless on capturing Lolo. Homer starts co-owning the boat with even more people and the boat sinks due to the weight. Lolo rampages at the Springfield Elementary School and Lisa stops him using Seinfeld to calm him down.\n\nLisa takes Lolo home to help him go back to a life of freedom and takes him to Dr. Jane Goodall at the Pennsylvania Ape Reserve where he will be loved. At Moe's Tavern, it ends well when Homer convinces the co-owners of being as good as someone who owns a boat because they owned one for five minutes.\n\nReception\nDennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C stating, “Lisa frees a killer whale. Bart frees a gorilla. Homer buys a boat. Bare story bones. Nothing wrong with that. The Simpsons’ world is made up of outlandish situations rendered possible, sometimes even plausible, by animation and the show's forgiving rules of reality. Some of the best episodes sound just as sparse in outline. Homer goes to space. Springfield gets a monorail. Lisa and Bart thwart a supervillain's plot to drown Springfield.\"\n\nTony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 2.5 out of 5, stating that the episode \"doesn't truly shine. There are a lot of very funny lines and gags, but nothing which truly distinguishes it as comic gold. This isn't the fault of Lisa's social justice warmongering. Kent Brockman offers cutting commentary after Lolo wreaks havoc on Springfield saying, 'The police, as always, are useless.'

Specifically, it requires signatory states to take and enforce measures in order to ensure that vessels do not endanger marine life, human life, or the environment when fishing. Furthermore, it sets basic principles for modifications to existing fishing vessels and the construction of new ones. The Convention applies to all registered fishing vessels, regardless of size or purpose. It requires fisheries to establish zones for fishing, restrict fishing to a certain time and place, and prohibit fishing after a certain number of catches have been taken. Similarly, it prohibits fishing out of season, in prohibited areas, and in waters not sanctioned by the signatory state. In addition, it prohibits destructive practices such as acidification, dynamiting, and bottom dredging. The Convention also places the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing its provisions on the signatory states. To facilitate enforcement, the Convention provides guidelines on the issuance of licenses and permits, establishes rules on the monitoring of vessels, and sets penalties for non-compliant vessels. The International Maritime Organization, the International Whaling Commission, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations all regularly review the Fishbein Convention to ensure its relevance in international fisheries management.

However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.\n\nAt a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and ‘several estates’ to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.\n\nFollowing the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.\n\nThroughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.\n\nVillage today \nIn the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.\n\nSee also\nListed buildings in Norton and Askern\n\nReferences\n\n \nNorton\nCivil parishes in South Yorkshire", "machine_text": " Norton is a large village located in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, England.

On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Les Avenières-Veyrins-Thuellin.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as Avenièrants or Avenièrantes.\n\nGeography\nLes Avenières lies on the left bank of the Rhône as it loops north some 25 km east by north-east of Bourgoin-Jallieu and 25 km west by north-west of Chambéry. The Rhone river forms the north-eastern border of the commune and is also the border between Isère and Ain departments. Access to the commune is by road D450 from Veyrins-Thuellin in the south-west which goes to the village then continues south-east to Saint-Genix-sur-Guiers. The D33 goes from Morestel in the north-west and passes through the north of the commune and across the Rhône bridge where it becomes the D10 and goes north-east to join the D19. The D40B goes north from the village to join the D33. The D40E connects the  D40 at the eastern edge of the commune to the D40B. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Le Chamolay, Curtille, Le Grand Chaffard, Le Maitre, Le Bessey, Le Sablonnet, and Les Nappes. The commune has a large forest in the north-east on the Île Molettes with a large urban area in the centre mixed with farmland, and in the south mixed forest and farmland.\n\nThe north-western border of the commune consists entirely of a left branch of the Rhône river as it loops north on its course through Lyon south to the Mediterranean. The Grand Canal de l'Huert forms the south-western border of the commune which curves to join the Huert river which is part of the northern border of the commune. The Canal du Champ forms the southern border of the commune where it connects the Grand Canal de l'Huert to the Bièvre river which forms the south-eastern border of the commune flowing north-east to join the Rhône.\n\nNeighbouring communes and villages\n\nToponymy\nThe name Avenières is derived from the Franco-Provençal avena meaning \"oats\".\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\nFrom the late Neolithic to the middle Bronze Age the region was inhabited by farmers. A scythe found in Les Avenières region is preserved in the Vienne Museum. It is the only evidence of human occupation before the Gallo-Romans. It was found at the confluence of the Bièvre and the Rhône.\n\nRoman Era\nIn 1989 maintenance work undertaken in the La Cour du Pont district led to the discovery of two oak piles at a depth of 2 metres. A Carbon-14 study undertaken by the centre for chronology at the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 (CNRS) gave a date between 39 BC and 120 AD.  It is possible that they were piles for a Gallo-Roman bridge used to cross the Rhone between Les Avenières and Thuellin.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages to modern times\nIn 1330 Aigline de Gerbais was married to Louis de Rivoire, knight, lord of Romagnieu, Domessin, la Bâtie-Montgascon, Villeneuve de Ciers (les Avenières), and Bruzolo en Piémont.\nIn 1496 notes and coins prove that Humbert of Baternay was deprived of the proceeds of the sale and transfer of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières by King Charles VIII.\nIn October 1496 Charles VIII issued Letters Patent ceding Dolomieu and Avenieres to Humbert of Bagternay.\nOn 22 January 1560 copies were made of letters agreed to by King Charles with René de Baternay on the subject of the lands of Ornacieux,  Dolomieu, and Les Avenières.\nOn 8 October 1609 Gabrielle de Baternay, widow of Gaspard de la Chastre, sold the lands and lordships of Avenières and Brangues as well as the Barony of Bouchage to M. of Granieu and Dorgeoise.\nIn July 1523 letters from François I stated that the possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières was held by René de Baternay. An order from the King's Council showed that René de Baternay would be restored to possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières.\nOn 15 March 1642 there was a memoir and instructions on the subject of the proceedings of the King's Council regarding the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières.\n\n20th Century\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the town was served two secondary railways: the Chemin de fer de l'Est de Lyon to Lyon and Aosta, and the Tramways départementaux de l'Isère, which was taken over by Tramways de l'Ouest du Dauphiné, to La Tour-du-Pin.

Located on the former route of the Rhône River, it is situated in the foothills of the Chartreuse Mountains, approximately 30 km north of Grenoble. The first written mention of Les Avenières dates from 1222, when it was listed as an estate belonging to the Abbaye de Savigny. In the early 14th century, Les Avenières was part of the fiefdom of the Dauphiny. Until 1790, the commune was divided into two hamlets: Les Avenières-Veurine and Les Avenières-Verse. Until the 19th century Les Avenières was mainly a rural community, with some cattle raising and light industry such as forges and fulling mills. In 1874, the arrival of the Compagnie Nationale des Chemins de Fer opened a new era of industry and the advent of modern factories producing cloth, tools and other goods. Today Les Avenières is predominantly a residential suburb of Grenoble, with numerous modern buildings and apartment blocks lining the streets of the commune. The village centre remains more true to its rural past, with its cobbled streets, houses of traditional Isérois style, and natural environment. The local economy is mostly driven by service industries and the small businesses of local artisans, with some agriculture and light industry kept alive. In addition to its proximity to the city of Grenoble, the commune is also served by the nearby towns of Voiron and Moirans. Les Avenières is home to two museums: the Musée des Religions et des Arts Populaires, which focuses on the region's history and religion; and the Musée de l'Objet-Livre, which houses some of the region's unique traditional objects. There is also an ethnological garden and an animal-breeding farm. Les Avenières is a popular tourist destination and is active in numerous sports activities and clubs. The community regularly organizes cultural and sporting events, such as the Les Avenières Normandie Wall Race, the Mont Fourchon Run and numerous tennis tournaments. The commune is also known for its vin de la terre and its Valrose green apples.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Solar (novel)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Solar is a novel by author Ian McEwan, first published on 18 March 2010 by Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Random House. It is a satire about a jaded Nobel-winning physicist whose dysfunctional personal life and cynical ambition see him pursuing a solar-energy based solution for climate change.\n\nPlot summary\nMichael Beard is an eminent, Nobel Prize–winning physicist whose own life is chaotic and complicated. The novel takes the reader chronologically through three significant periods in Beard's life: 2000, 2005 and 2009, interspersed with some recollections of his student days in Oxford.\n\n2000\nMiddle-aged, balding and slightly overweight womanizer Beard falls into a depression after learning that his fifth wife, Patrice, has begun an affair with their builder, a man called Tarpin. Despite being a Nobel award-winning physicist Beard realizes all his best work was done as a young man and now coasts on his reputation heading a research centre in Reading that seeks to harness wind energy. One of the younger researchers at the centre, Tom Aldous, tries to speak to Beard about the potential of solar energy but Beard shuts him down.\n\nAfter seeing Patrice with a bruise on her face Beard goes to confront Tarpin, but finds himself no match for the man and leaves after causing a scene in front of Tarpin's neighbours. Depressed over his marriage Beard accepts an invitation to go to the Arctic as part of a retreat on climate change. While there he realizes he is the only scientist among groups of artists who believe passionately in climate change (which he remains skeptical of) though they treat him with respect, believing his research in wind-based energy constitutes concrete steps towards combatting global warming.\n\nBeard returns home from his trip deciding to divorce Patrice. Arriving early however he encounters Tom Aldous in his bathrobe. After Beard tells him he will ruin his career Aldous begs him not to imploring him that his research into photosynthesis and solar energy is more important than the feud between the two of them. While pleading for his career Aldous trips on a rug and strikes his head against a coffee table. Beard realizes that if he calls the police he could be blamed for Aldous's death and instead plants evidence of Tarpin's presence.\n\nTarpin is indeed arrested and convicted of Aldous's murder and Beard is painted in the media as a sympathetic figure who had been cuckolded by his wife. Aldous's research on solar energy is given to Beard as it had been labelled with his name.\n\n2005\nBy 2005, Beard is experiencing a career resurgence due to his research into solar energy which in actuality was the research of Tom Aldous. Beard no longer works for the government having been fired after giving a press conference in which he stated that the lack of women in science was due to the natural limitations of their gender. The ensuing anger into his comments caused a media storm and resulted in his womanizing past being scrutinized in the press.\n\nHe has a sexual relationship with a younger woman named Melissa who owns a string of dance supply shops whom he deliberately refuses to marry despite her desire for a child. Returning home from a trip Melissa informs Beard that she is currently pregnant having stopped taking birth control pills. Beard is angry and tries to think of ways to convince Melissa to have an abortion.\n\n2009\nBeard is now a father, and sixty-two years old. He is not in the best of health, and is worried about a suspicious-looking lesion on his wrist. His solar power plant is in the final stages of construction in Lordsburg, New Mexico, where he has acquired another girlfriend, Darlene, a waitress. Darlene wants to marry him, but he has a very comfortable set-up with Melissa and his three-year-old daughter, Catriona. All his problems culminate on the eve of the opening ceremony for his solar power plant. Tarpin is out of jail and turns up looking for work, Melissa flies to New Mexico with his daughter to try and win him over from Darlene, a patent lawyer arrives with proof that he stole his ideas from the now-dead Aldous, his doctor confirms the lesion on his hand is cancerous, his business partner abandons him to multimillion-dollar debts, and then he learns that somebody (presumably Tarpin) has sabotaged his power plant by smashing the solar panels. In the final scene Beard gets an \"unfamiliar, swelling sensation\" in his heart which he interprets as love for his daughter, but may well be the onset of a heart attack.\n\nBackground\nThe novel is primarily a work of fiction but draws heavily on references to real science and modern history.\n\nMichael Beard's trip to the Norwegian Arctic island of Spitsbergen is based on a 2005 trip McEwan made with art and climate change organisation, Cape Farewell. The group of artists and scientists that McEwan travelled with included Antony Gormley and Rachel Whiteread.  He later said of the trip:\n\nReception\nIn 2010, Solar was awarded the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize, a British literary award for comic writing.\n\nExternal links\nReview by RealClimate\nReview by Publishers Weekly\nAudiobook review by Publishers Weekly\n Review by The Independent\nReview by The Guardian\nReview by The Telegraph\nReview by Time (magazine)\n Ian McEwan presents \"Solar\" in Barcelona, Canal-L\n\nReferences\n\n2010 British novels\nNovels by Ian McEwan\nNovels set in the Arctic\nJonathan Cape books\nNovels set in Berkshire\nFiction set in 2000\nFiction set in 2005\nFiction set in 2009\nNovels set in New Mexico\nClimate change novels", "machine_text": " Solar is a science fiction novel, written by Ian McEwan and published in 2010. It details the story of Michael Beard, a Nobel laureate physicist, who is struggling to stay relevant in a rapidly changing scientific climate. The novel explores Beard's life, relationships and circumstances as he embarks upon a journey of self-discovery. It covers his marital woes, his attempts at a mid-life career rejuvenation through an ambitious global warming project, and ultimately his moral dilemma between self-interest and ethical responsibility. The novel opens with an account of Beard's life in his 40s and recent past. He is married for the fifth time to a woman substantially younger than him. He is an acclaimed physicist and Nobel Laureate, but his reputation is beginning to dwindle as his research has become seemingly formulaic and unimaginative. Beard seeks to gain back some of his past success with an ambitious new project - applying quantum physics to global warming solutions. His research takes him to a remote island in the Arctic and as he applies his theories to the project, he finds himself in a deep moral quandary. His research demands compromise, compromise that proves too much for his moral compass. Soon, he finds himself trapped in a web of secrets and lies and a world of moral gray areas. The moral choices he makes have personal, professional and global implications. The novel has been praised for its attention to detail, the complexity of Beard's character and the masterful way in which McEwan weaves in current scientific theory with Beeard's personal journey. Solar is a thought-provoking and timely novel. It succeeds in elevating the global warming crisis and its personal and ethical implications from the realm of political discourse and into the human experience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26518872}

He is best known for his exploits during theCivil War, when he fought alongside Gaius Julius Caesar against the forces of Pompeius Magnus and the Senate. Raised in an aristocratic household of consular rank, Eurycles was the son of the prominent soldier and senator Gaius Julius Eurycles, making him a patrician of Rome who could trace his lineage back to one of the most prominent families in Roman history. He likely had a military education, which is why he served as both a cavalry officer and an infantry commander later in his life. Like many of his patrician peers, Eurycles joined the forces of Gaius Julius Caesar in the Civil War, a two-year conflict which pitted the dictator against his old compatriots in the Senate. He quickly rose through the ranks, and during the Battle of Pharsalus he was placed in command of Julius Caesar's cavalry, distinguishing himself by turning a difficult situation into a decisive victory for Caesar. After Pharsalus, Eurycles was placed in command of a number of legions and was given a commission to continue the fight against Pompey and his followers. Eurycles' success continued, as he defeated Pompeius' troops in Sicily, Greece, and finally at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. After the complete victory of Caesar, Eurycles was rewarded with the title of proconsul and given a large area in east-central Italy to govern. In 45 BC, Eurycles was appointed to join Caesar's government as one of the consuls of Rome. As a consul, he was required to be active in the Senate and oversee judicial issues. In this post, he continued to support of Julius Caesar's every law, even speaking in its favor in the Senate on numerous occasions. In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was assassinated and his successor, Marcus Antonius, immediately turned to Eurycles for help in consolidating power. The two men worked closely together and Eurycles even served as the admiral of Antonius' forces during his land expedition against the Parthians in 41 BC. Unfortunately, Eurycles and Antony were unable to stop the assassins of Julius Caesar, as the conspiracy between Melanus and Brutus was too strong. Despite his failure to protect Julius Caesar, Eurycles remained a loyal member of Antony's inner circle and offered him advice on political and military matters. Eurycles also took part in the Battle of Actium, where he was captured by Octavian's forces and later died in captivity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Best of Hilary Duff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Best of Hilary Duff is the first greatest hits album by American recording artist Hilary Duff. It was released on November 11, 2008, by Hollywood Records. The 12-track album consists of eight of Duff's previous singles, as well as two new recordings: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\", and two remixes to the songs. Only one single was released from the album, the Ryan \"Alias\" Tedder-produced \"Reach Out\", which became her third single to chart at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play.\n\nBackground\nDuff confirmed that she had collaborated with a rapper called Prophet on a previously unheard song on the Dignity tour's set list, \"Reach Out\" in September 2007. In an interview with remix producer Joe Bermudez in November 2007, she said that Dignity would be re-released in a CDVU+ edition featuring remixes of the original songs alongside two new tracks: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\". Duff said she hoped to write a third new song for the re-release, and to have \"Holiday\" released as its first or second single;  However, Hollywood Records scrapped the plans, adding to their large list of cancelations, which in turn led Duff to make the decision to leave the label and develop Best of Hilary Duff to quickly end her contract, which had expected one more album.\n\nUnlike Duff's first compilation album Most Wanted (2005), which was advertised as strictly a compilation, Best of was strictly advertised as a greatest hits, making it her first.\n\nCritical reception\n\nBest of Hilary Duff received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic gave the album a positive review stating that Best of Hilary Duff \"is a flipside of her 2005's Most Wanted\", which was \"pitched squarely at bright, happy tweens\". They also went on to say the album \"is not a look back at the past but a blueprint for the future\". Allmusic gave the album a 3.5/5 star rating.\nCommonsensemedia said that \"parents need to know that Miss Duff has turned up the heat with sexually provocative lyrics that may be too hot to handle for younger fans. Hilary Duff isn't for tweens anymore. The hit single \"Reach Out\" features more aggressive sexual lyrics than on previous albums. While Dignity was OK for 11-year-olds, the Best Of compilation pushes the target age higher. The funky remixes and danceable electronic beats are fun and catchy, but the sexed-up lyrics and themes aren't intended for younger fans.\"\nRachel Devitt of Rhapsody said the collection \"is largely pleasant, nicely polished and, rather surprisingly, sleek and even a little edgy. Turns out Lizzie McGuire is a dancefloor diva, and even with that feathery little voice, she manages to work it on tracks like the dark \"Stranger,\" saucy new tune \"Reach Out\" and a clubby remix of \"Dignity.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nOn November 29, 2008, Best of Hilary Duff debuted at number 125 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 5,500 copies in its first week of release in the US, making it her least successful album to date. Many people believe this was due to a lack of promotion from her record label at the time Hollywood Records and her change in sound of music which many believe resulted in Duff losing some of her younger fans. This is her first album not to receive any RIAA certifications. As of September 2012, the album has sold over 35,000 copies in the United States alone.\n\nSingles\n\"Reach Out\" was released as the only single from the album. The music video is directed by Philip Andelman and five official versions were released (though some have leaked first). The music video premiered on Duff's official MySpace on October 28, 2008.\n\nTrack listings\n\nNotes\n  signifies a remixer.\n  signifies an original producer and remixer.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of the Japanese edition of the album\n\n Hilary Duff                  – vocals & executive production \n Prophet           – vocals \n Haylie Duff                  – vocals \n Ryan Tedder                  – production & engineering \n Derrick Haruin                   – production \n Vada Nobles                  – production & mixing \n Logic                            – production & mixing \n Rhett Lawrence               – production, mixing & engineering \n Dead Executives  – production & mixing ; bass guitar \n John Shanks                  – production ; mixing \n The Matrix – production, mixing, arrangement & recording \n Matthew Gerrard                  – production \n Chico Bennett                – production ; remixing ; additional production \n Charlie Midnight             – production \n Denny Weston Jr.             – production \n Desmond Child                – production \n Andreas Carlsson             – production \n Andre Recke                      – production ; executive production \n Spider                           – production \n Phil Tan                         – mixing \n Jason Graucott                   – mixing \n Dave Pensado                     – mixing & engineering \n Steve McMillan                   – mixing & engineering \n Jeff Rothschild                  – mixing \n Rob Chiarelli                    – mixing \n Joel Soyffer                     – mixing \n Dave Way                         – mixing \n Richard Vission              – remixing \n Caramel Pod E                    – remixing \n Joe Bermudez                     – remixing & additional production \n Dirty Freqs                      – additional production \n Brian Reeves                     – additional recording & mixing \n Jay Landers                      – executive production \n Jon Lind                         – executive production \n Dean Butterworth                 – drums \n Monique Powell                   – background vocals \n The Fruit                        – background vocals \n Allan Hessler                    – engineering assistance \n Robert Vosgien                   – mastering \n Leslie Kee                       – photography & creative direction\n Enny Joo                         – art direction & design\n\nCharts\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences\n\n2008 greatest hits albums\nAlbums produced by Chico Bennett\nAlbums produced by John Shanks\nAlbums produced by Matthew Gerrard\nAlbums produced by Ryan Tedder\nAlbums produced by the Matrix (production team)\nHilary Duff compilation albums\nHollywood Records compilation albums", "machine_text": " Best of Hilary Duff is a music compilation album by American singer Hilary Duff.

Curr was born in Sheffield, England. He travelled to Hobart Town, arriving in February 1820. In 1823 he returned to England. In 1824 he was appointed manager of the newly formed Van Diemen's Land Company which had arranged to buy 250,000 acres (101,173 ha) of land in the north-west of the colony.\n\nCurr arrived back in Hobart in May 1826 and headed north to survey his company's land. He established the company's base at Circular Head by September 1826.\n\nCurr was a member of the Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land 1825 to 1826 (later Tasmania). As a Roman Catholic, Curr refused to take the required oath – that he did not believe in fundamental tenets of the Catholic faith and that he deny any allegiance to the descendants of Catholic monarch James II. Governor Arthur waived the requirement and wrote to Secretary for Colonies, Earl Bathurst, for advice on 21 April 1826. In the reply of 11 December, the advice confirmed that Curr was not prevented from taking his position.\n\nCurr visited Melbourne in 1839 and returned to settle in 1842. He was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council for the District of Port Phillip (later to become the colony of Victoria) for two periods (from 1 September 1845 to 31 May 1846 and from 1 September 1848 to 31 May 1849). From 1844 until his death in 1850, he was extremely active in the movement for separation of Victoria from New South Wales. He became known as the \"Father of Separation\".\n\nCurr had a wife (Elizabeth) and eleven surviving children, the eldest being Edward Micklethwaite Curr.

He was born in Hipperholme, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. He migrated to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1824, to capitalize on the free grants of land available to emigrants. Curr was the eldest son of Richard Curr and his wife Elizabeth, née Crabtree. Curr was very active in the early development and growth of Australia's fledgling pastoral industry, and established successful runs in Victoria and South Australia. He made numerous journeys around Victoria and New South Wales, and was one of the first English explorers to cross overland from Van Diemen's Land to the mainland. In 1835, Curr explored the country south-west of Port Philip (now Melbourne) and named the area Western Port district. Curr's explorations generally involved scouring the countryside for suitable land for sheep grazing. As well as exploring and developing land for Australia's wool industry, Curr saw the potential for capitalizing on the Trans-Australian railway in the early 1830s. He leased and purchased several large land properties in the Port Phillip district, and established a successful trading post in the region. This post specialized in supplying produce and wares to remote settlements in the area. In 1836, Curr was appointed gunner of Port Fairy and, later, of Portland district. He also successfully managed a number of properties that he had acquired in the region. Curr was the driving force behind the establishment of a sawmill at Port Fairy, and is credited with introducing the first barley and potatoes to the area. In addition to his profitable venture in trading and land acquisitions, Curr was a leading figure in the development of education in the region. He established and endowed a school for boys and girls in Port Fairy in 1856. In 1845, his wife, Mary, established the Edward Curr Children's Home in Rupanyup. The Catholic order of St. Patricks, which ran the home, provided a midpoint between the convict settlements and the frontiers of the new colonies. In death, Curr left a considerable estate, which included grazing and dairying properties, sawmills, and country store businesses. He is remembered as a pioneer and capitalist who played an important role in the development of early Australian pastoralism. He was honoured in the naming of Victorian towns, including Currie, a township in the Wimmera Region in Victoria. Curr died in Portland, Victoria on 13 December 1850. He was survived by his wife and seven children.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24406206}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Meade Conflict\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Meade Conflict refers to a dilemma where an economy faces conflict between its internal and external balances. The phenomenon was proposed by the British economist and Nobel Prize Laurent James Meade in his influential book The Theory of International Economic PolicyThe Balance of Payments (1951). Trevor Swan developed this problem into Swan diagram, which became more influential in the economic theory. The discovery has also led to other models such as Tinbergen's Rule.\n\nAnalysis \nAccording to Meade's analysis, a country can find itself in the following four circumstances:\n\nThe problems in cases (a) and (b) can be solved using economic policies. Case (a) requires a expansionary fiscal and monetary policies that will reduce the surplus and spur recovery from the recession, while case (b) is the circumstance vice versa.\n\nHowever, in case (c), if the government and central bank of the country tries to restore payment equilibrium by expansionary policies, these measures will worsen inflation. The other alternative of tight fiscal and monetary policies means reduced inflation, but also worsen the surplus in payments. In the similar dilemma of case (d), the deficit implies that tight monetary and fiscal policies should be used, which worsens the country's recession, while the expansionary policies that will end the recession would worsen the payments deficit. Cases (c) and (d) are known as the Meade Conflict.\n\nInfluences \nThe phenomenon draws wide attention in China as the country was going through such circumstances in 2007 and 2018. The term has become more popular in Chinese news and literature than in some English-speaking countries.\n\nReferences \n\nMacroeconomics", "machine_text": " Meade Conflict was a civil dispute occurring in Meade County, Kentucky between 1785 and 1791. It was a conflict between multiple property owners, local residents, and the Kentucky state government, which was created in 1792. The conflict began when Colonel Thomas McGee, a former Revolutionary War officer and politician, purchased a large parcel of land in Meade County in 1785. Upon his purchase of the land, McGee was granted a provisional title to the land and began the construction of a settlement, which he named Kimberley. However, several other individuals had already settled in the area, claiming to have rights to a portion of the land through earlier purchases or settlement. These individuals formed a group of claimants referred to as the “Meade County War Reapers” and threatened to use violence to gain control of the land. McGee and the War Reapers returned to court in 1788 to settle their claims, but the court sided with McGee in the case. Following the court’s decision, the War Reapers resorted to unlawful activities in order to gain control of the land. In 1790, the War Reapers illegally sold portions of the land to unknowing buyers and began to fortify the area. The Kentucky state government quickly sent a force of militia to investigate the situation, however, the militia was forced to retreat due to the War Reapers’ superior numbers. In response to the militia’s failure to take control of the area, the Kentucky government proposed a legislative bill which designated the land as part of Meade County. After the bill was passed in 1791, the War Reapers were arrested and charged with criminal activity. They were also forced to surrender control of the land to McGee and the Kentucky state government, who were then granted the authority to officially designate the land as part of Meade County. The Meade Conflict resulted in a resolution that favored the Kentucky state government and Colonel Thomas McGee, who was granted full ownership of the land he purchased in 1785. This conflict set an important precedent for the newly formed state of Kentucky, setting the stage for future engagement with land disputes and conflicts. The conflict also serves as an important reminder of the importance of following laws and respecting property rights.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59343896}

The season saw Anzhi Makhachkala, the reigning champions of the Russian Premier League, finish in 10th place. The season began under new Anzhi Makhachkala boss Rene Meulensteen following the departure of Guus Hiddink at the end of the 2012–13 season. Anzhi kicked off the season with a 1–0 home win over FC Kuban on April 20, 2013. Anzhi had a strong start to the season with wins over Kuban, Dynamo Moscow and Krylia Sovetov Samara giving them a tally of seven points from the opening three games. Anzhi would soon find their feet and began to creep up the table. On 3 February, just after the winter break, they played their biggest game of the season against city rivals Dinamo Moscow. The game ended in a 2–1 defeat, but Anzhi still ended the game in 5th place. Anzhi won the Russian Cup on 27 May 2014. This meant that the club qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the 2014–15 season. On the league front, Anzhi fell away from the top three after a poor run of form, culminating in a defeat against FC Rostov in the 40th game of the season. Anzhi then dropped as low as 12th place, before ending the season in 10th place. Despite their league finish, Anzhi’s qualification for the Europa League meant that the season was seen as a successful one for the club. In the UEFA Europa League, Anzhi were knocked out in the group stages after finishing third in their group. They earned four points, with a 5–0 win over Litex Lovech the highlight of their campaign. The season saw the emergence of several key players, including Oleg Shatov and Aleksandr Bukharov. Shatov was the club’s key attacker, scoring nine goals, while Bukharov scored seven. Overall, the 2013–14 season was a successful one for FC Anzhi Makhachkala, as they ended the season with a Russian Cup win and qualified for Europe.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39576252}

In 1879 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Naples. He became a follower of Mazzini and adhered to Italian irredentism. He had a particular interest in both ancient history and for the social problems of Southern Italy, inspired by the example of the historian Giustino Fortunato.\n\nCiccotti, raised in the poor southern region of Basilicata, adhered to the group of socio-political thinker's known as meridionalisti (\"southernists\"), aspiring to solve the economic problems of Southern Italy after the Italian unification. They claimed that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north.\n\nAcademic and political activist\nIn 1889, Ciccotti attended the University of Rome and gained a teaching qualification in classical antiquities. He won the competition for the ancient history chair at the Scientific-Literary Academy (Accademia scientifico-letteraria) in Milan in 1891. Meanwhile, he started to cooperate with the socialist Filippo Turati and his journal Critica Sociale. He adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), where he raised the issue of the underdevelopment of Southern Italy. His political involvement caused him the hostility of the Milanese conservatives, and in 1897 he lost his position at the Academy.\n\nHe was appointed professor of ancient history at the University of Pavia, but his attacks on the government and solidarity for the workers on the occasion of the tragic events in Milan in May 1898 earned him an arrest warrant for subversive incitement. He went into exile, taking refuge in Geneva (Switzerland), hosted by Maffeo Pantaleoni. Here he met Vilfredo Pareto and the German social-democrat August Bebel, and wrote a report on the events in Milan, The revolt of Milan: Notes of a refugee, but lost his job at Pavia.\n\nAs a historian, Ciccotti was the first to give a Marxist economic account of the decline of slavery in the Roman Empire, in contrast to religious-ethical explanations in his book Il tramonto della schiavitu nel mondo antico (The Sunset of Slavery in the Ancient World), published in 1899. Economic changes rendered slavery expensive and inefficient, and doomed it to extinction.\n\nPolitical career\nIn June 1900, he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies (1900-1904) in the Vicaria district of Naples, upsetting the traditional electoral alliance between local politicians and the Camorra. In 1904, he lost his seat due to active campaigning of the Camorra against him. He was re-elected in 1909 and remained a Deputy until September 1919. Meanwhile, Ciccotti initiated the translation in Italian of the major works of the Socialist theorists Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle.\n\nIn the decade before the First World War, he gradually distanced himself more and more from the official line of the Socialist Party, although he kept on contributing to the socialist newspaper Avanti!. He criticized the party, which he considered to be too much focused on the problems of the \"Northern\", industrialist working man, and too little inclined to understand the problems of the impoverished rural populace of the South. Ciccotti defined the prejudices against southern Italians as the anti-Semitism of Italy. In contrast with the PSI, he was in favour of an Italian intervention in the First World War.\n\nSenator and death\nHis pro-war stance and dislike of the liberal Giovanni Giolitti – Ciccotti called Giolittianism the \"death of political life\" –, and in opposition to the post-war revolutionary movements, he looked sympathetically at the rising Fascism an its leader Benito Mussolini. \"In today's evident scarcity of political personalities, Mussolini is the one that more than any other, if not the only one, can deserve this name,\" Ciccotti wrote in September 1922.\n\nIn September 1924, he was rewarded with a seat for life in the Italian Senate. He opposed the move to authoritarian rule of Mussolini, but did not resign. He mainly dedicated his time to study history. In 1931, when demanded to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, Ciccotti initially protested, but eventually took the oath all the same. Finally he opposed, and openly, to the dictatorship of Mussolini when he sensed that the regime was heading to the adventure of a war, which he considered the inevitable conclusion of authoritarian and populist regimes. He died in Rome on 20 May 1939 at the age of 76.\n\nReferences\n\n De Grand, Alexander J. (2001).

Ciccotti was born in Rome. He began studying music at the age of 8, learning the piano. During his adolescence he was primarily interested in jazz and studied jazz at the conservatory of Santa Cecilia in Rome. After graduating he moved to New York City, where he worked as a freelance composer and musician in sync with contemporaries like Harry Belafonte, Charles Mingus, and Gil Evans. During this period he wrote hundreds of musical pieces and arrangements in the fields of jazz, funk, and popular music. In the early 1970s, Ciccotti returned to Italy and focussed on soundtracks and other original compositions. His compositions have been used in films and television programs, including films such as L'invenzione della morte, La controfigura and La stella che non c'è, as well as the television series Il commissario De Luca. In recent years, his compositions have featured in numerous commercial campaigns for Italian and international companies, including Corona Extra, Fiat, Raiffeisen, and Rolex. Ciccotti is a frequent collaborator with the composer V. Venuti, and together they have released two albums, Il volume del vento and La luna incantata. Their work has been praised by critics and music fans alike for its rich sound, fusing cinematic and neoclassical influences. In addition to his work as a composer and musician, Ciccotti has also been involved in various teaching and mentoring activities, most notably as a lecturer of music at the Faculty of Arts and Music of Tuoro University, Rome. He also founded the \"Eta d'Oro\" studio in Rome, which serves as both an educational centre as well as a production studio. Ciccotti has won numerous awards, including in 2011 the prestigious \"Silver Ribbon\" award for best music, given by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists for his soundtrack for the film Il commissario De Luca. In 2021, Ciccotti released the album Nostalgia, featuring a mix of classical and contemporary music, in collaboration with the Italian pianist Lorenzo dall'Ozzo. The album was praised by critics for its inventive composition and masterful performances. Today, Ciccotti is considered one of the most important names of the Italian music scene, and continues to bring his unique vision to a diverse range of projects.

After 1831, he was called to the Bar of England, and was an advocate of the Court of Common Pleas. Throughout his life, Bedell published various works related to Teutonic literature, most notably his translations of Icelandic sagas. In 1844, he published a version of Egill Skallagrímsson’s Saga, which was the first English translation of this saga. Bedell also translated several Eddic poems, as well as the Rune Poem, which is the only surviving Rune poem in English. Among his other translations were 'Viglundar Saga' from Thomas Thoroddsen and 'Grettis Saga' from George Stephens in 1862. In 1865, Bedell established the University of London's first Chair in Scandinavian Language and Literature. This prompted a resurgence of interest in Scandinavian language and culture, and consequentially led to increased academic activity in this field. It was likely through Bedell’s efforts that Icelandic Studies, and Scandinavian branch of Germanic studies within the University of London, were formed. All of Bedell's translations were of a very high quality, and were greatly admired. His ability to capture the essence of the material he was working with, while still producing a finished product that was understandable to a contemporary English reader, was commended. In addition to his translations, Bedell was also the author of several works on Scandinavian poetics. Bedell’s work had a lasting impact on the scholarship of Teutonic culture and literature. His translations opened up these works to a wider audience, and provided a greater level of materials to be studied and analysed.

This was, arguably, inevitable, as Sting's Joe had to win the first time to keep himself in the game: at this point Claw's Ayesha could choose not to deploy Repeat if she won first time. Having hardly tried the first time, Ayesha flew across, trouncing an exhausted Joe.\nHighway/Shadow Mountain - To win the teams must traverse the valley below the mountain on wires 20 metres above the forest floor. The teams must climb the 1500 metre mountain tied together while planting their flags as they go, the first team to summit and raise their final flag will escape and win. Claw won this as they had a huge time advantage and Kyran had breathing problems and Oscar hurt himself on the other team. Claw were awarded with a trip to another tropical island where Caroline and Reggie were waiting with smoothies and mobile-phones so they could call their family before they started the long journey home.\n\nControversy\nBullying Incident\nSeason 1 of Scorpion Island started with two less contestants than expected. Unconfirmed Reports suggest that this was due to one contestant's attempts to ostracise another from the group. Both contestants left the group before filming commenced, despite the producers attempts to reconcile the situation.

The programme is presented by Laura Hamilton and Steve Backshall. It was first broadcast as part of the BBC's \"Frozen Planet\" season in 2006. The premise of the show involves seven teams of two children aged between 11 and 14 being stranded on ‘Scorpion Island’, an artificial location situated off the Australian coast. From here, the teams must complete a series of physical, mental and emotional challenges, in order to win points and be the eventual winners of the series. In addition, the teams are joined by a Skipper, who assists throughout the game and helps to guide the teams through various tasks. Throughout the game, certain elements vary with each series. These include a change of location to one of six different \"regions\" of the island, based on a fictional area of Australia with unique plants, animals, tribes and cultures. The teams are also required to compete in a range of physical tasks and mental activities in order to reach their final objective – to collect enough points and pass the victory boat to win. There are a total of nine episodes in the series, with the last team standing winning a trip to Antarctica. Throughout the series, the teams must solve puzzles in order to locate the keys to the victory boat, as well as passing a range of physical tasks, such as rock-climbing, raft-building, orienteering and abseiling. The series was released on DVD in 2007, with the narrated version of the series becoming available in August 2008.

C. Little under the name Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory. (Roscoe B. Jackson was a one-time head of the Hudson Motor Company who helped provide the funds for the first laboratory building at the property and the first five years of operation.)\n\n Established that cancer is a genetic disorder, a novel concept before the Laboratory's founding in 1929.\n Dr. Leroy Stevens first described cells that can develop into different tissues – today known as stem cells. \n Dr. Elizabeth Russell performed the first bone marrow transplants in a mammal, leading to new treatments for blood and immunological diseases.\n Dr. George Snell won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for providing an in-depth understanding of the immune system's major histocompatibility complex, making organ transplants possible.\n Dr. Douglas L. Coleman discovered the hormone leptin, central to obesity and diabetes research, earning him the Shaw Prize, the Albert Lasker Award, the Gairdner International Award, Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine, and the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine.\n Is pioneering the use of cancer avatars – mice with implanted human tumors – to test targeted therapies for cancer patients.\n\nRecent research has provided insight into cancer stem cells and treatments for leukemia; progress with type 1 diabetes and lupus; and a breakthrough in extending mammalian life span.\n\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) first received its National Cancer Institute designation in 1983 in recognition of the foundational cancer research conducted there. The JAXCC is one of seven NCI-designated Cancer Centers with a focus on basic research.\n\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center has a single program, \"Genetic Models for Precision Cancer Medicine,\" composed of three biological themes: cancer cell robustness, genomic and genetic complexity, and progenitor cell biology. The themes emphasize the systems genetics of cancer and translational cancer genomics, and all are supported by the JAX Cancer Center's technological initiatives in mouse modeling, genome analytics and quantitative cell biology.\n\nThe Morrell Park fire\nOn May 10, 1989, a flash fire destroyed the Morrell Park mouse production facility. The fire raged for five hours, requiring over 100 firefighters from 15 companies and a total of 16 trucks for the fire to be contained. Four workers of the Colwell Construction Company who were installing fiberglass wallboard in the room where the fire broke out were injured, one with burns over 15 percent of his body. While none of the foundation strains were lost, 300,000 production mice (about 50% of their stock) died, resulting in a national shortage of laboratory mice and the layoff of 60 employees.\n\nThis was the second fire to severely affect the laboratory; the 1947 fire that burned most of the island destroyed most of the laboratory, and its mice. Worldwide donations of funds and mice allowed the lab to resume operations in 1948.\n\nResearch resources\n Hosts the Mouse Genome Informatics database, by far the world's most significant source for information on mouse genetics and biology.\n Distributes more than 3 million JAX mice annually to more than 20,000 investigators in at least 50 countries for research and drug discovery.\n Offers more than 11,000 genetically defined strains of JAX mice to the international research community.\n Provides animal husbandry, reproductive science and in vivo drug efficacy services in a wide range of therapeutic areas for biomedical researchers.\n Conducts over 100 educational seminars and webinars yearly to educate and enable external biomedical researchers.\n\nEducational programs\n\n Summer Student Program has brought thousands of talented high school and college students to campus over 89 years for mentoring, including three who later won Nobel Prizes: David Baltimore, Howard Temin and Jack Szostak. \n Nearly 700 students, researchers and physicians attend Laboratory courses, conferences and workshops annually.\n Participates in three collaborative degree programs: the Tufts University Ph.D. program in Genetics, the Ph.D. program in Biomedical Sciences of the University of Maine, and the Master's of Science in Teaching program of the University of Maine.  \n Offers predoctoral and postdoctoral training programs and a visiting scientists program.\n Coordinates and hosts the Maine State Science Fair for high school students.\n\nBusiness model\nThe Jackson Laboratory is recognized by the IRS as a public charity.  According to organization literature, revenue comes primarily from the sale of materials and services (~70%) and from government support (~25%).  Less than 5% of 2012 revenue came from charitable donations.\n\nNotable researchers\nEdison Liu\nNadia Rosenthal\nCharles Lee\nMuriel Davisson\nGeorge Weinstock\nLeroy Stevens\nElizabeth Russell\nGeorge Snell\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2013, a jury in Maine found that Jackson Laboratory did not violate that state's whistleblower protection law when they fired an employee who claimed to have been terminated after reporting her concerns about the treatment of animals to the National Institutes of Health Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare. The worker accused the laboratory of \"allowing mice to suffer and then die in their cages instead of euthanizing them\" and of cutting off the toes of mice to identify them. Jackson Laboratory denied the allegations and said the worker was fired for her confrontational demeanor.\n\nIn 2009, Jackson Laboratory was fined $161,680 by the EPA for improperly handling and storing hazardous materials.\n\nSee also\nHighseas, a former Bar Harbor summer estate owned by the laboratory\nAnimal Testing\n\nReferences\n\nMount Desert Island\nBuildings and structures in Bar Harbor, Maine\nMedical research institutes in the United States\nCancer organizations based in the United States\nCompanies based in Hancock County, Maine\nScientific organizations established in 1929\nMedical and health organizations based in Maine\nResearch institutes in the United States", "machine_text": " Jackson Laboratory is a research institute located in Bar Harbor, Maine, which is dedicated to biomedical research and the study of genetics.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hämeenlinna\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hämeenlinna (; ; ;  or Croneburgum) is a city and municipality of about  inhabitants in the heart of the historical province of Tavastia and the modern province of Kanta-Häme in the south of Finland. Hämeenlinna is the oldest inland city of Finland and was one of the most important Finnish cities until the 19th century. It still remains an important regional center. The medieval Häme Castle (also Tavastia Castle; ) is located in the city.\n\nHämeenlinna is known as the birthplace of Finnish national composer Jean Sibelius. Today, it belongs to the region of Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), and before 2010 it was the residence city for the Governor of the province of Southern Finland. Nearby cities include the capital Helsinki (), Tampere () and Lahti (), the regional center of Päijänne Tavastia (Päijät-Häme).\n\nThe current neighboring municipalities of Hämeenlinna are Akaa, Asikkala, Hattula, Hausjärvi, Hollola, Janakkala, Loppi, Padasjoki, Pälkäne, Tammela, Urjala and Valkeakoski. The former municipalities, Hauho, Kalvola, Lammi, Renko and Tuulos, were consolidated with Hämeenlinna on 1 January 2009; with these municipal associations, the Hattula municipality is almost completely surrounded by Hämeenlinna.\n\nThe coat of arms of Hämeenlinna is based on the 17th century town seal, which in turn refers to the Häme Castle built by the Lake Vanajavesi in the Middle Ages, near which the city was founded. The current coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers on the basis of the old coat of arms, and was confirmed on September 21, 1956.\n\nGeography\n\nThere are a total of 339 lakes in whole or in part in the area of the city of Hämeenlinna. The largest of them are Lake Vanajavesi, Lake Kukkia and Lake Kuohijärvi. The main features of the Hämeenlinna landscape are the Häme Lake Plateau, the Vanajavesi Valley and the Kanta-Häme Grove Center. In many places, the landscapes are marked by the prosperous Tavastian agricultural culture.\n\nCityscape\nThe center of Hämeenlinna is located on the Saarinen Hill on the shores of Lake Vanajavesi, and is bordered on the west by Highway 3 (E12), while Highway 10 bypasses the city to the south and east. The street network in the center is based on a grid pattern drawn up by C. L. Engel in 1832 with the Market Square as its center. On the edge of the market square are the town hall, Hämeenlinna Church and the Häme County Government House. The city center is divided into four districts, which are Linnanniemi, Koilliskulma, Hämeensaari and Saaristenmäki. Raatihuoneenkatu, which has been partially transformed into a pedestrian street, is the most significant shopping street in the city center; for example, at the western end of the street, the Goodman Shopping Center was completed in October 2014.\n\nThere are plenty of buildings of different styles in the city center, and in proportion to the city’s population, it is quite large and densely built. The most significant expansion direction in the city center in the 2010s has been the Keinusaari district on the other side of Lake Vanajavesi, where, for example, the city's railway station is located. New supplementary construction has also been carried out in the city center on an ongoing basis. The center of Hämeenlinna has been ridiculed as the \"Finland's largest lighted cemetery\".\n\nHistory\nThere was a settlement called Vanaja by the Lake Vanajavesi where the city now stands since the Viking Age. The castle was built in the late 13th century to secure Swedish power in central Finland. A village was established near Häme Castle to provide services and goods to its inhabitants.\n\nThe village was granted city rights on January 19, 1639 and soon after that the King of Sweden moved it one kilometre () south to the hill on which it still stands. The city is known for its schools and academies where many famous Finns have studied. Schools, government and the military have characterised the life of Hämeenlinna throughout history. Finland's first railway line, the  (, ), opened between Hämeenlinna and Helsinki on March 17, 1862. The current Hämeenlinna railway station ( in Finnish) was built in 1921.\n\nDemographics\n\nNotable natives or residents\n\n Jouko Ahola (strongman/actor)\n Antony Hämäläinen (vocalist) \n Eino Leino (poet) \n Antti Miettinen (NHL player); won a bronze medal with Finland in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics\n Victorine Nordenswan (painter)\n J.

The city is located in the southern part of Finland, about 100 kilometres north of the capital Helsinki. The city of Hämeenlinna was established in 1578 by King John III of Sweden as a fortification town in order to protect the northernmost part of his kingdom, Finland. The King thought that by building a fortress on the riverbanks in the region, he could protect his kingdom from Russian and Lithuanian invasions. The main economic activity of Hämeenlinna is manufacturing. There are many companies located in the city that work in the fields of rubber and plastic manufacturing, electronics, furniture, textile, and paper production. The population is also engaged in activities related to the IT and service sectors. The city is also home to the oldest university in Finland, the University of Helsinki.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wesley O. Smith\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wesley Oliver Smith (April 16, 1878October 20, 1951), commonly known as W. O. Smith, was an American newspaper publisher and businessman from southern Oregon.  He owned the Klamath Republican and later the Evening Herald, both Klamath Falls newspapers.  Smith was a Republican who served two two-year terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing what are today Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Jefferson, Klamath, and Lake counties.\n\nEarly life \n\nSmith was born on April 16, 1878 in French Lake, an unincorporated area of New Brunswick, Canada.  He was the son of George F. Smith and Anna Smith.  His family left Canada and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, when he was eight years old.\n\nIn 1895, Governor William H. Upham commissioned Smith as a second lieutenant in the Wisconsin National Guard.  He served in Company E of the Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry from the time of his commissioning to August 1897.  Company E was based in Eau Claire.  With the onset of the Spanish–American War, Smith rejoined the Wisconsin National Guard as a non-commissioned officer.  He served as first sergeant for Company E.  After the war, Smith moved to Harrison, Idaho, where he briefly worked cruising timber before moving on to Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nLife in Klamath Falls \n\nIn Klamath Falls, Smith worked for a short time in the lumber business. Then in 1903, he bought the Klamath Republican from W. Huse and Sons.  The Klamath Republican was a weekly newspaper that had been published in Klamath Falls since 1896.  When he took charge of the paper, Klamath Falls had five newspapers competing for reads in a community of only 3,000 people.\n\nSmith married Jessie Applegate on December 11, 1904.  She was the youngest daughter of Captain Ivan D. Applegate, an early Klamath County pioneer.  Nine months later, she died in Klamath Falls, three days after giving birth to a son.  Smith married his second wife, Lena L. Hargus, on October 24, 1906.  She was the widow of Doctor H. B. Hargus, and was also the sister of Smith’s first wife.  They remained together for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1908, Smith acquired another Klamath Falls newspaper, the Evening Herald (now the Herald and News), from its founder Fred Cronemiller.  After buying the Evening Herald, he purchased and installed a new Linotype machine, the first automated typesetting machine in the Klamath Falls area.  Under his management, the Evening Herald became the area’s leading newspaper.  Smith continued to publish the Klamath Republican along with the Herald.  He eventually changed the Klamath Republican from a weekly to a semi-weekly publication.  In 1914, he merged it in to the Evening Herald as a semi-weekly supplement.\n\nSmith also started a printing business in Klamath Falls.  His printing firm was called W. O. Smith Printing Company.  While it was separate from his newspaper, it was located in the same building as the Evening Herald.\n\nSmith was also a prominent member of the Klamath Falls community.  He was active in civic affairs and local politics.  He helped finance construction of the local Odd Fellows building, the first large office building in Klamath Falls.  He also joined the local Elks lodge and helped raise funds to build the Klamath Falls Elks building.  Smith later served as president of the local Elks lodge.  In politics, he was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, serving as a recording clerk for the Klamath Falls voting precinct and then as chairman of the Klamath County Republican Central Committee.\n\nState representative \n\nIn 1912, Smith decided to run as a Republican for a District 21 seat in the Oregon House of Representatives.  At that time, District 21 had two seats that represented Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties as well as Crook County (which at that time, still included what are now Deschutes and Jefferson counties).  Smith and Vernon A. Forbes of Bend were the only Republicans to file for the District 21 seats. Since the Republican Party was allowed to nominate two candidates for the two District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were both nominated in the Republican primary.  Since no Democratic candidates filed for the District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were unopposed in the general election.\n\nSmith took his seat in the Oregon House of Representatives on January 13, 1913, representing District 21.  He worked through the 1913 legislative session which ended on March 5.  During the session, he served on the powerful ways and means committee as well as the irrigation committee.  Later in the session, Smith was appointed to a special committee assigned to investigate conditions in Oregon’s state prisons.  Smith was an active member of the House throughout the session.  A fiscal conservative, Smith successfully pushed a bill through the legislature that standardized government accounting within the state.  After the session, he received special recognition from eastern Oregon farmers for his work on the irrigation committee.\n\nIn 1914, Smith decided to run for re-election, seeking to retain his District 21 House seat.  He was joined by fellow incumbent Republican, Vernon Forbes.  There were also two candidates running in the Democratic primary, P. H. Dencer of Bend and Fred W. Hyndman of Klamath Falls.  Since there were two District 21 seats available both parties could nominate two candidates for the general election.  As a result, all four candidates were advanced to the general election.  In the November election, Smith and Forbes retained their House seats.  The final general election tally was 1,366 votes for Smith, 1,157 votes for Forbes, 982 votes for Hyndman, and 742 votes for Dencer.\n\nSmith began his second term representing House District 21 on January 11, 1915. The session lasted six weeks, ending on February 20.  During the session, Smith was appointed to the ways and means, irrigation, military affairs, and printing committees.\n\nIn 1916, Smith ran for a third term in the Oregon House of Representatives.  Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created.  While these changes did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district.  While Smith and Forbes had been the only two Republicans to file for the District 21 seats in the past two elections, two additional Republicans decided to join the field in 1916.  The two new Republican candidates were Denton G. Burdick of Redmond and Albert E. Elder of Klamath Falls.  In addition, Fred Hyndman filed as a Democrat.  In the Republican primary, Forbes and Burdick were advanced to the general election while Hyndman was nominated in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 1920 and 1922, several Oregon newspapers identified Smith as a possible candidate for one of the District 21 seats.  However, he did not run for state office again.\n\nLater life \n\nAfter his 1916 primary defeat, Governor James Withycombe appointed Smith as Oregon’s delegate to the International Farm Congress and the International Irrigation Congress.  Both meetings were held in El Paso, Texas, in October 1916.\n\nIn 1920, Smith sold the Evening Herald to E. J. Murray so he could focus on his commercial printing business.  He modernized the company's printing operation, acquiring a new press with an automatic press feeder system.  In 1926, Smith moved his business to a new modern building in downtown Klamath Falls. Four years later, W. O. Smith Printing Company merged with Drummond Printing of Klamath Falls.  The new business brought together a full suite of modern printing equipment under one roof.  The company was incorporated in 1929 as Smith-Bates.  It was capitalized at $50,000 with 500 shares valued at $100 per share.  Smith and his wife were primary shareholders.\n\nInstead of returning to state politics, Smith ran for a city council position in Klamath Falls.  He was elected and took his seat in 1921.  He served two terms on the city council.  After leaving the council, he continued to serve Klamath Falls as chairman of the city’s budget committee.  In 1930, the city of Klamath Fall decided to update its city charter.  Smith was appointed chairman of the 15-person committee that evaluated various options for improving the city’s government.  His committee recommended the city adopt a new form of government based on a city manager structure.\n\nSmith also remained involved in fraternal and civic affairs.  He was active in the local Elks lodge.  He helped establish a Boy Scout program in Klamath Falls.  Smith was also a founding member of the local Rotary club and was that organization’s first president. In addition, he served as president and trustee of the local golf country club.  \n\nDue to an extended illness, Smith was confined to his home for the last six years of his life.  He died at his home in Klamath Falls on October 20, 1951 at the age 73.  His funeral service was held at the Klamath Falls Elks lodge on October 23, 1951.  Smith was buried in the Linkville Cemetery in Klamath Falls.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n List of Oregon Legislators by Session\n Wesley Oliver Smith at Find a Grave\n\nMembers of the Oregon House of Representatives\nPoliticians from Klamath Falls, Oregon\nOregon city council members\nOregon Republicans\nBusinesspeople from Oregon\nEditors of Oregon newspapers\n1878 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Sunbury County, New Brunswick\nCanadian emigrants to the United States\nWisconsin National Guard personnel\nPoliticians from Eau Claire, Wisconsin\nPeople from Kootenai County, Idaho\n19th-century American people\n20th-century American people", "machine_text": " Wesley O.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (soundtrack)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is the soundtrack album to the 2016 Hindi-language film of the same name directed by Neeraj Pandey. Based on the life of former Indian cricketer MS Dhoni, the film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher in pivotal roles. The album consists of nine songs composed by Amaal Mallik in his first album as a solo composer, with one song being composed by Rochak Kohli as a guest composer, featuring lyrics written by Manoj Muntashir. The vocals were performed by Armaan Malik, Arijit Singh, Siddharth Basrur, Rochak Kohli, Palak Muchhal, Ananya Nanda and Adithyan A. Prithviraj. The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.\n\nThe album was recorded entirely using live instrumentation and has only one soundscape used considering the theme of the film. After M. M. Kreem, whom collaborated with Pandey for the soundtracks: Special 26 and Baby, refused his offer on his priorities with Baahubali: The Beginning (the first film in Rajamouli's Baahubali franchise) despite composing one promotional single, Pandey chose Amaal Malik for the film soundtrack and initially recorded six songs within March—October 2015. No lip-syncing is used in the songs, as the team believed that the songs blend in the narrative. The album released in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi with the lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Chaitanya Prasad and Guru Thakur for the respective languages. Out of the seven songs, a promotional track \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" (also released in Tamil) and two alternate versions of the songs were used in Hindi version, while the Telugu and Marathi album have seven tracks.\n\nThe album opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Amaal Malik for using single soundscape and retaining the freshness and melody in the tracks, but criticised for the familiarity of the tunes. The tracks \"Besabriyaan\", \"Kaun Tujhe\", \"Phir Kabhi\" and \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" received the most consumer response and Palak Muchhal, the singer of \"Kaun Tujhe\" received a News18 and Screen Award for Best Female Playback Singer respectively.\n\nProduction \nInitially Neeraj Pandey planned to rope in M. M. Kreem as the composer for the film's soundtrack, after whom the director worked with him in Special 26 (2013) and Baby (2015). Kreem also composed the promotional track \"Phir Se\" written by Manoj Muntashir and recorded by Divya Kumar, for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Indian cricket team. Pandey being a cricket buff said that the idea was \"to sum up the mood and emotion for the entire nation\" and called the song as a \"tribute to the inherent passion our players have for the country and the love we have towards our own team\". Both the director and the composer worked on the song and video in short span of time so as to release the track before the tournament which begins on 14 February 2015. The song received overwhelmingly positive response and Pandey eventually planned to rope Kreem as the composer. But, Kreem's commitments on Baahubali franchise led Pandey to choose a different composer for the songs. When Pandey listened to the song \"Sooraj Dooba Hain\" from the film Roy (2015), Pandey eventually approached the composer of the song, Amaal Malik to work for the biopic's songs along with Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series. Malik had eventually composed two single songs for the label —  \"Chal Wahan Jaate Hain\" and \"Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main\" — both of them featured Tiger Shroff as the lead.\n\nAmaal Malik composed 25 songs in his film career when he was being a part of multi-composer soundtracks for films, but this was his first album as a solo composer. Initially, the team had planned for a multi-composer setup for the songs in the film, but as Amaal Malik composed the first track \"Besabriyaan\", the team decided to retain him as the composer for the soundtrack. Within October 2015, Malik finished composing six tracks for the film's soundtrack with three of them being romantic numbers which highlighted Dhoni's relationship with his wife Sakshi Dhoni, from the time they first meet to post marriage. Bhushan made Malik sit for nights explaining him the feel and requirement of each song in the film. The album does not have the characters lip-syncing to the songs but will play in the background as they wanted the score to complement the cricketer's image and the album was further recorded with live instruments.\n\nMalik said that the seven songs have \"fine blend of rock and orchestral elements\". He explained that \"The album maintains a balance between commercial and the inspirational aspect, even if one has not seen the movie, they would still be able to relate to the songs, which is why the songs work as stand-alone tracks\"; also adding that the album maintains a single sort of soundscape, which he called as the \"most difficult to crack\", calling the film as \"one of his toughest projects in his career\".\n\nAlbum information \nThe track \"Besabriyaan\" which was the first to be composed which is about Dhoni's early life that how he juggled between studies and cricket simultaneously. The second song \"Kaun Tujhe\" is about the relationship with his late girlfriend Priyanka Jha, who died in a tragic accident in 2002. The third song from the film entitled \"Jab Tak\" is about Dhoni's first meeting with his wife Sakshi in the film. Rochak Kohli was announced as the guest composer for the film's soundtrack and composed a promotional single titled \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" which is about the craze of cricket in India and public opinion about the sport. It was initially started as the theme of street cricket in India, but Kohli described the song as \"a tribute to dreams and the fight to achieve the dreams\". He further described the song as \"a metaphor for everyone in India who has the potential to rise above their immediate realities to achieve them\" and as \"an emotional song that connects to everyone, in every by-lane of the country, with the hope and passion to succeed\". This song was released in Tamil as \"Ulagam Engum Dhoni Ye\" sung by S. P. Charan and lyrics written by Pa. Vijay. However, it was not featured in the Telugu and Marathi versions of the soundtracks. The promotional song \"Phir Se\" which was made by M. M. Kreem for the 2015 Cricket World Cup was not included in the film.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Times of India, Rinky Kumar gave the soundtrack album a rating 3 out of 5 adding: \"the album has a mixed bag of tracks, some of which make quite an impression and while others are nothing to write home about\". Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi also rated 3 out of 5, calling the album as \"quite decent\" and praised Amaal Malik for a \"great effort in his first solo album\". Writing for India Today, Devarsi Ghosh added that: \"the album has a few stock market-friendly hit-gaana type numbers, every once in a while, Amaal tries to move away from monotony and do something interesting\". Critic based at Daily News and Analysis praised Amaal Malik for the use of live instruments in the film's soundtrack, calling it as \"a more full-blooded feel\", and further added that \"the album has a couple of snags, but that could not stop the album's winning inning\".\n\nJoginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 4.5 out of 5 saying \"The music of M.S. Dhoni is good and there is nothing unlikeable about it. Though one doesn't expect the music to become chartbuster from a long term musical experience, in the context of the film most of them should fit in well.\" Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave a 4 out of 5 rating to the soundtrack saying \"Amaal Mallik makes his mark as a solo music director\". A critic from India.com said that \"there is some not-so-wow kind of songs too, but the album will still be liked – thanks to the soft romantic tracks\". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in called that \"Mallik has a hit strike rate with the mushy numbers, but he has his work cut out for him if he wants to diversify into other styles\". Critic Gaurang Chauhan of BollywoodLife.com said that the album has \"quite a few hummable tunes to it\" and called the album as a \"must listen for all the romantic hearts\". A critic from Behindwoods gave the album 3 out of 5 calling it as \"an impressive album which stays perfectly true to the film's genre\". Vipin Nair of Music Aloud criticised the soundtrack saying it as \"the album is largely marred by the familiarity in its tunes\", with a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Megha Mathur of The Quint opined that \"Amaal Mallik's compositions are not as dynamic or disruptive as the film's protagonist, despite few long lasting melodies\". She further called that \"The OST falls short of making the biopic a spectacular experience\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nHindi\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nMarathi\n\nRelease history\n\nChart performance \n\n Weekly charts\n\n Year-end charts\n\nAccolades\n\nPersonnel \nCredits adapted from CD liner notes\n\n Amaal Mallik – Composer (All tracks), musical arrangements (All tracks)\n Meghdeep Bose – Music producer (Track 1,2,3,10), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,10)\n Sourav Roy – Music producer (Track 4)\n Keshav Dhar – Music producer (Track 5), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Ankur Mukherjee – Music producer (Track 5), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,6,10), live guitar (Track 4), ukulele (Track 4)\n Jim Sathya – Music producer (Track 6)\n Aditya Dev – Music producer (Track 7)\n Rochak Kohli – Music producer (Track 8)\n Joell Mukherji – Music producer (Track 9), acoustic guitar (Track 9), electric guitar (Track 9)\n Armaan Malik – Acoustic guitar (Track 4), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Dev Arijit – Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Mohit Dogra – Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Rushad Mistry – Bass guitar (Track 1,6)\n Jeeni Dutta – Electric guitar (Track 5)\n Jai Row Kavi – Drums (Track 5)\n Sivamani – Drums (Track 8), percussions (Track 8)\n Firoz Khan – Keys (Track 8)\n Krishna Jhaveri – Bass (Track 5)\n Omkar Dhumal – Shehnai (Track 7)\n Tejas Vinchurkar – Flute (Track 1,2,10), Woodwinds (Track 1)\n Suresh Lalwani – Strings (CMA Musicians, Mumbai) [Track 1,3]\n Dipesh Varma – Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Daboo Malik – Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Omkar Salunkhe – Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Keyur Barve – Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Amey Londhe – Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Vincent Joseph – Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Surajit Ghoshmazumdar – Vocal recording (T-Series Studios, Mumbai) [Track 2]\n Rahul Sharma – Vocal recording (Asia Music Vision, Mumbai) [Track 4]\n Akshay Kamat – Vocal recording (RK Music Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], music assistance\n Vijay Dayal – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Chinmay Mestry – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Shantanu Hudlikar – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Abhishek Khandelwal – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Manasi Tare – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Julian Mascarenhas – Live instrumentation recording (Enzy Studios, Mumbai) [Track 4,8]\n Eric Pillai – Audio mixing (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks], mastering (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks]\n Bharat Goel – Audio mixing (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], mastering (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8]\n Ninad Lad – Audio mixing (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9], live instrumentation recording (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9]\n Donal Whelan – Audio mastering (Mastering World, London) [Track 9]\n Michael Edwin Pillai – Mixing assistance (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai)\n Shayan Chakraborty – Mixing assistance (Orbis Studio, Mumbai)\n Krish Trivedi – Music assistance\n Sid 'Sky' Singh – Music assistance\n Yash Narvekar – Music assistance\n Zaid Patni – Music assistance\n Shishir A Samant – Music assistance\n Gaurav Sanghvi – Music assistance\n Anvay Patil – Music assistance\n Rujul Deolikar – Music assistance\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n2016 soundtrack albums\nHindi film soundtracks\nTamil film soundtracks\nTelugu film soundtracks\nT-Series (company) soundtrack albums\nSports film soundtracks\nBiographical film soundtracks", "machine_text": " M.S.

It is known as the Northwest Freeway and travels in an L-shape through Boone and McHenry counties. It runs from an interchange with U.S. Route 12 in Belvidere to the Wisconsin state line, north of the city of Hebron. It is the longest state route in Illinois. Route 133 was first designated in 1927 as a much shorter route running from Belvidere to Wauconda. The construction of the Northwest Freeway began in 1958 in order to relieve congestion on other routes. The initial design of the freeway, which was completed in 1966, had six exits, three located in McHenry County and three located in Boone County. Route 133 was extended south in 1969 to an intersection with U.S. 12 and Illinois Route 76. In 1990 the final stage of expansion was completed when the freeway was extended north all the way to the Wisconsin state line, bringing the total length of the route to 68 miles (109 km). There are now eleven exits along the route in Illinois. The scenic route passes through rural parts of northern Illinois. Route 133 generally follows an area of higher elevation than the surrounding land, passing over many hills like Mosier Hills and Rams Hill, offering an elevated viewpoint of the passing countryside. The route also passes through many small towns and communities, including Woodstock, Harvard, and Capron.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Princess Belle-Etoile\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Princess Belle-Etoile is a French literary fairy tale written by Madame d'Aulnoy. Her source for the tale was Ancilotto, King of Provino, by Giovanni Francesco Straparola.\n\nIt is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 707 The dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird.\n\nSynopsis\n\nA queen was reduced to poverty, and to selling sauces to support herself and her three daughters.  One day, an old woman came to them and begged that they feed her a fine meal.  They did so, and the woman, being a fairy, promised that the next time they wished something without thinking of her, it would come true.  For a long time, they could not make a wish without thinking of her, but one day, the king came by.  The oldest daughter, Roussette, said that if she married the king's admiral, she would make sails for all his ships; the second, Brunette, that if she married the king's brother, she would make him lace enough to fill a castle; the third, Blondine, that if she married the king, she would bear him two sons and a daughter, who would have golden chains about their necks and stars on their foreheads, and jewels would fall from their hair.\n\nA favorite repeated their words to the king, who summoned the sisters, and soon the marriages were concluded.  A splendid wedding feast appeared out of nowhere, served on golden dishes, and the women realized it was from the old woman.  Roussette hid the dishes when they left, but they were turned to earthenware when she arrived.\n\nThe king's mother was furious to hear that her sons had married such lowly women. Roussette was jealous of her sisters. Brunette gave birth to a son, and died. Blondine gave birth to two sons and a daughter, and the queen and Roussette put three puppies in their place. They took the children, including Brunette's, and gave them to a maid, who scrupled to kill them, but put them in a boat, with necklaces that might pay for their support if someone found them.  The queen was sent back to her mother.\n\nThe fairies guarded the boat until it fell in with a pirate ship.  The captain brought them to his childless wife. When they found that jewels fell from the children's hair, the captain gave up his piracy, because he would be rich without it.  They named the princess Belle-Etoile (French for \"Beautiful Star\"); her older brother, Petit-Soleil (\"Little Sun\"); her younger, Heureux (\"Happy\"); and their cousin, who did not have the chain or star but was more beautiful than his cousins, Chéri (\"Darling\").\n\nAs Belle-Etoile and Chéri grew up, they fell in love, but believing themselves brother and sister, deeply regretted it.  One day, she overheard the pirate and his wife talking, and learned where they had come from.  She told her brothers and cousin, and they told the pirate and his wife that they wished to leave.  The pirate implored them to stay, but Heureux persuaded him that they wondered too much about their birth to endure it.  They set sail in a marvelous ship.  It arrived at the castle of the king their father, and the king marveled over them.  They asked only for a house in which to stay.\n\nThe Queen mother realized from the description that these were her grandchildren. She sent the maid who had failed to drown them, and the woman told Belle-Etoile that she needed the dancing water, which would keep her from ever looking old. She told that story, and Chéri set out at once, against her will. He found a spring and rescued a dove from drowning. It set all sorts of animals that burrow to dig up the dancing water, and Chéri returned with it. He freed the dove and it flew off rather sulkily.\n\nThe maid came back with a tale of a singing apple, and Chéri once again set out.  This time, a reading stranger directed him to the apple, and by helping a wounded dove, he gained the knowledge of the dragon that guarded it, and how it could be frightened off by mirrors, and returned with the apple.\n\nThe maid returned with a tale of a little green bird that knew everything.  Belle-Etoile was deeply distressed by this, as she realized it could tell her who their parents were, and where they came from. Chéri set out again, but when he had nearly reached the bird, the rock opened, and he fell into a hall and was transformed into stone. Belle-Etoile fell ill from her distress at his absence, and Petit-Soleil set out to find Chéri, but suffered the same fate, and then Heureux did the same.\n\nBelle-Etoile set out after them, and rescued a dove from snow.  It advised her not to climb the mountain where the bird perched, but to sing below it, and lure it down. She did so, and the bird advised her on how to free her brothers and all the rest of the prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen Mother had persuaded the king to have his marriage to Blondine set aside, and marry again.  Roussette persuaded the queen to invite Blondine to the wedding.  The king invited the four children, and left a gentleman to await their arrival.  The gentleman, on their arrival, told them the king's story.  Belle-Etoile and her brothers arrived for the wedding, bringing their treasures, told how they were abandoned, and showed them to the king.  Finally, the king asked the green bird who these children were, and where they came from.  The bird proclaimed that they were the king's children and nephew.\n\nThe Queen Mother, Roussette, and the maid were all punished, and instead of marrying himself, the king married his daughter Belle-Etoile to Chéri.\n\nLegacy\nAs pointed by James Planché, author and dramatist who adapted several of MMe. d'Aulnoy's tales for the stage, the tale had remarkable similarities with Antoine Galland's The Sisters who envied their Cadette. He also noticed that the tale, when adapted to the English stage, renamed Prince Chéri as Prince Cherry and Princess Belle-Étoile as Princess Fair Star.\n\nAnalysis\nThe story is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 707, \"The Three Golden Children\" or, in French-language sources, L'Oiseau de Vérité (\"The Bird of Truth\").\n\nDistribution\nIn French sources, there have been attested 35 versions of the tale (as of the late 20th century). 19th century scholar Francis Hindes Groome noted that the tale could be found in Brittany and Lorraine. A similar assessment, by researcher Gael Milin, asserted that the tale type was bien attesté (\"well attested\") in the Breton folklore of the 19th century.\n\nVariants\nFrançois-Marie Luzel collected from Brittany Les trois filles du boulanger, or L'eau qui danse, le pomme qui chante et l'oiseau de la verité (\"The Baker's Three Daughters, the Dancing Water, The Singing Apple, and the Bird of Truth\") - from Plouaret -, and Les Deux Fréres et la Soeur (\"The Two Brothers and their Sister\"), a tale heavily influenced by Christian tradition. He also provided a summary of a variant from Lorient: the king goes to war while his wife gives birth to two boys and a girl. The queen mother exchanges her son's letter and orders the children to be cast in the water and the wife to be mured. The children are saved by a miller and his wife, who raise the children and live comfortably well due to a coin purse that appears under the brothers' pillow every night. Years later, they go in search of their birth parents and come to a castle, where are located the \"pomme qui chante, l'eau qui danse et l'oiseau qui parle\". They must cross a graveyard before they reach the castle, where a fairy kill those who are impolite to her. The brothers fail, but the sister acts politely and receives from the fairy a cane to revive everyone at the graveyard. They find their father, the king, but arrive too late to save their mother.\n\nJean-François Bladé recorded a variant from Gascony with the title La mer qui chante, la pomme qui danse et l'oisillon qui dit tout (\"The Singing Sea, The Dancing Apple and The Little Bird that tells everything\"). This tale preserves the motif of the wonder-children born with chains of gold \"between the skin and muscle of their arms\", from Dolopathos and the cycle of The Knight of Swan.\n\nOther French variants are: La branche qui chante, l'oiseau de vérité et l'eau qui rend verdeur de vie (\"The singing branch, the bird of truth and the water of youth\"), by Henri Pourrat; L'oiseau qui dit tout, a tale from Troyes collected by Louis Morin; a tale from the Ariège region, titled L'Eau qui danse, la pomme qui chante et l'oiseau de toutes les vérités (\"The dancing water, the singing apple and the bird of all truths\"); a variant from Poitou, titled Les trois lingêres, by René-Marie Lacuve; a version from Limousin (La Belle-Étoile), by J. Plantadis; and a version from Sospel, near the Franco-Italian border (L'oiseau qui parle), by James Bruyn Andrews.\n\nEmmanuel Cosquin collected a variant from Lorraine titled L'oiseau de vérité (\"The Bird of Truth\"), which is the name used by French academia to refer to the tale.\n\nA tale from Haute-Bretagne, collected by Paul Sébillot (Belle-Étoile), is curious in that if differs from the usual plot: the children are still living with their mother, when they, on their own, are spurred on their quest for the marvelous items. Sébillot continued to collect variants from across Bretagne: Les Trois Merveilles (\"The Three Wonders\"), from Dinan.\n\nA variant from Provence, in France, collected by Henry Carnoy (L'Arbre qui chante, l'Oiseau qui parle et l'Eau d'or, or \"The tree that sings, the bird that speaks and the water of gold\"), has the youngest daughter, the princess, save an old man she meets in her journey and who gives her advice on how to obtain the items, and who turns out to be an enchanted youth.\n\nAn extended version, almost novella-length, has been collected from a Breton source and translated into French, by Gabriel Milin and Amable-Emmanuel Troude, called L'Oiseau de Vérité (Breton: Labous ar wirionez). The tale is curious in that, being divided in three parts, the story takes its time to develop the characters of the king's son and the peasant wife, in the first third. In the second part, the wonder-children are male triplets, each with a symbol on his shoulder: a bow, a spearhead and a sword. The character who helps the youngest prince is an enchanted princess, who, according to a prophecy by her godmother, will marry the youngest son (the hero of the tale).\n\nIn another Breton variant, published in Le Fureteur breton (fr), the third seamstress sister wants to marry the prince, and, on her wedding day, reveals she will give birth to twins, a boy with a fleur-de-lis mark on the shoulder, and a girl.\n\nTwo variants were collected by Charles Joisten from Dauphiné: L'oiseau de vérité (\"The Bird of Truth\") and La pomme d'or, l'oiseau des quatre vérités et l'eau qui fait revenir les morts (\"The Golden Apple, the Bird of Four Truths and the Water that Brings Back the Dead\").\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Princess Belle-Etoile\" in The Song of Sixpence, by Walter Crane, from Project Gutenberg\nIllustrated Edition of Princess Belle-Etoile at WalterCrane.com]\n\nWorks by Madame d'Aulnoy\nFrench fairy tales\nBelle-Etoile\nBelle-Etoile\nPiracy in fiction\nFemale characters in fairy tales", "machine_text": " Princess Belle-Etoile is a fictional character in the fictional kingdom of Lumeria, which was created by the Belgian writer Suzanne Bodart.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Final Doom\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Final Doom is a first-person shooter video game developed by TeamTNT, and Dario and Milo Casali, and was released by id Software and distributed by GT Interactive Software in 1996. It was released for MS-DOS and Macintosh computers, as well as for the PlayStation, although the latter featured a selection of levels from Final Doom and from Master Levels for Doom II.\n\nFinal Doom consists of two 32-level episodes (or megawads), TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. Unlike TNT: Evilution, which was officially licensed, The Plutonia Experiment was made by request of the team at id Software. The story in both episodes take place after the events of Doom II. TNT: Evilution features a new soundtrack not found in Doom and Doom II.\n\nGameplay\n\nFinal Doom plays identically to Doom II: Hell on Earth, and even features the same weapons, items, and monsters. The original game is widely considered to be significantly more difficult than its predecessors Doom and Doom II.\n\nThe gameplay in the PlayStation version of Final Doom is nearly identical to that found in the PlayStation version of Doom, and, in addition, it was compatible with the PlayStation Mouse. Compared to the MS-DOS original, the PlayStation version's overall difficulty was significantly reduced. Many of the harder levels were removed and those that remained often had enemies taken out (most noticeably the Cyberdemon being removed from the level 'Baron's Lair'). As in the original PlayStation version of Doom, many of the larger levels from the original MS-DOS versions of Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II were removed, and both the Arch-vile and Spider Mastermind monsters were removed, due to technical constraints. This limited the PlayStation version to 30 levels in total. The more traditional rock tracks featured in Final Doom were replaced by a creepier ambient soundtrack by Aubrey Hodges, who later composed the music for Doom 64 in 1997.\n\nThere are several noticeable alterations to the presentation of Final Doom in the PlayStation version compared to the computer versions. The simplistic title screens featured in the computer versions have been replaced by a more elaborate title screen that features the animated flame-filled sky texture from the original PlayStation version of Doom. Many of the levels' sky textures have been replaced by different ones; some levels' skies are replaced by sky textures seen in previous Doom games, whereas others now feature a new starry sky texture. Finally, most of the level layouts are simplified, similar to previous Doom console ports, and the frame rate of the game is often lower than it was in the first PlayStation Doom game.\n\nPlot\n\nTNT: Evilution\nIn TNT: Evilution, the UAC are once again intent on developing and experimenting with dimensional gateway technology. They set up a base on one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well; when the first experimental gateway is opened, they annihilate the forces of Hell. Research continues with more confidence and all security measures turned at the gateway.\n\nA few months later, the yearly supply ship comes ahead of schedule, and looks strange and unusually big on the radar. The lax radar operators decide that there is nothing to worry about. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built out of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship's enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the entire facility is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.\n\nThe main character, the nameless space marine (who was revealed to be the marine commander on the moon) has been away on a walk at that time and thus escapes death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp, he rushes back to the base where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. He then swears that he will avenge his slain troops and sets out to kill as many demons as possible.\n\nIn the end, the marine defeats the Icon of Sin and the game describes \"something rumbles in the distance. A blue light glows within the ruined skull of the demon-spitter.\"\n\nThe Plutonia Experiment\nIn The Plutonia Experiment, after Hell's catastrophic invasion of Earth, the global governments decide to take measures against any possible future invasion, knowing that the powers of Hell still remained strong. The UAC is refounded under completely new management (the old trustees and stockholders were all dead anyway) and aims at developing tools that would prevent demonic invasions.\n\nThe scientists start working on a device known as the Quantum Accelerator that is intended to close invasion Gates and stop possible invasions. The experiments are carried out in a secret research complex, with a stationed detachment of marines. The work seems to be going well but the creatures from Outside have their attention drawn towards the new research. A Gate opens in the heart of the complex and unnatural horrors pour out. The Quantum Accelerator performs superbly: the Gate is quickly closed and the invasion is stopped. Research continues more boldly.\n\nOn the next day, a ring of 7 Gates opens and an even greater invasion begins. For one hour the Quantum Accelerators manage to close 6 of the Gates, but the Hellish army has become too numerous and too strong. The complex is overrun. Everyone is slain, or zombified. The last Gate of Hell remains open, guarded by a Gatekeeper: a powerful, enormous and ancient demon that has the power to open Dimensional Gates and control or protect them.\n\nThe government, frantic that the Quantum Accelerator will be destroyed or used against humanity, orders all marines to the site at once. The player, the nameless space marine, was on leave at the beach. He was also closest to the site and gets there first. There he discovers that there is much demonic activity (howling, chanting, machine sounds) within the complex; the Gatekeeper is obviously working on something, and his work would soon reach some awful climax. He also realizes that when the marines arrive, they would not be able to penetrate the heavily infested complex, despite the firepower and support they will have. The marine decides to enter the complex and stop the Gatekeeper alone.\n\nDevelopment\nWork on TNT: Evilution was started by TeamTNT, a group of WAD-making hobbyists who were active on the advanced Doom editing mailing list. Just days before it was to be released as a free download online, the project was acquired by id Software, and finished in November 1995.\n\nBrothers Dario and Milo Casali, who had contributed four levels to TNT: Evilution, were assigned the task of creating what became The Plutonia Experiment after having sent an eight-level WAD they had created to American McGee and managing to impress him along with the rest of the id Software crew. They created 16 levels each for The Plutonia Experiment in four months time, and submitted them in January 1996. Unlike their contributions to TNT: Evilution, which were edited after submission (four were also rejected due to being too large to run on the computers of the day), these were the final revisions of the levels, and Dario Casali later commented about the fact that no changes were requested: \"Thank God because I was ready to throw my computer out the window at the time.\"\n\nDario Casali acknowledged the difficulty level of The Plutonia Experiment in an interview on Doomworld, stating \"Plutonia was always meant for people who had finished Doom 2 on hard and were looking for a new challenge. I always played through the level I had made on hard, and if I could beat it too easily, I made it harder, so it was a challenge for me.\"\n\nReception\n\nReviewing the PC version in GameSpot, Jim Varner argued that Final Doom is a waste of money, since it is essentially just a new set of level maps for Doom, and there were already thousands of such maps available to download for free on the internet.\n\nWhile Major Mike of GamePro criticized that Final Doom has no new enemies or weapons, and that the PlayStation version includes only 30 levels as compared to the PC version's 64, he was pleased with the \"huge, perplexing, and sometimes sadistic levels\" and the new scenery, and considered Doom still a compelling enough game that simply more of the same was enough to satisfy. PlayStation Magazine gave it a score of 9/10, calling it \"essential\". A reviewer for Next Generation was less impressed, remarking that a side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation version of the original Doom reveals that Final Doom has a much lower frame rate, less precise control, and more visible seams in the textures. Three of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly said they were tired of seeing ports of Doom, and that Final Doom was simply another such port with new level maps. They also said that the game engine had become severely outdated in the years since Doom was first released. Crispin Boyer was the one dissenting voice, expressing enthusiasm for the new level designs.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n Interview with Dario Casali (1998) by Doomworld\n\nExternal links\n Final Doom page at PlanetDOOM\n Final Doom at TeamTNT's official website\n Dario Casali's The Plutonia Experiment page\n id Software's official Final Doom page\n Comparison of PC and Playstation Final Doom at ClassicDOOM\n\n1996 video games\nCooperative video games\nDoom (franchise)\nVideo games about demons\nDoom engine games\nDOS games\nGames commercially released with DOSBox\nGT Interactive Software games\nId Software games\nClassic Mac OS games\nPlayStation (console) games\nPlayStation 3 games\nPlayStation Network games\nVideo games developed in the United States\nVideo games scored by Aubrey Hodges\nVideo games with 2.5D graphics\nVideo games with digitized sprites\nVideo games set in hell\nWilliams video games\nWindows games\nVideo game spin-offs\nSprite-based first-person shooters\nHorror video games\nde:Doom#Final Doom", "machine_text": " Final Doom is a stand-alone game developed by id Software and released on May 31, 1996, for MS-DOS. The game consists of thirty-two levels arranged in four episodes, each episode containing eight levels. In the original release, two of the episodes are designed for the registered version of Doom II and the other two for the commercial version, The Ultimate Doom. It was later released for the PlayStation and Saturn as part of the Doom compilation on November 17, 1997, and for the GBA parts of Doom II along with other Doom games on November 17, 2002. The goal for each level is to locate the exit or it may have a hidden exit; clears all enemies; and triggers any events or switches necessary to activate the exit. In some levels, the exit is revealed only when all the enemies are eliminated. When all the levels are completed, a bonus game is unlocked. Final Doom is a shooter game in which the player's goal is to navigate through levels and defeat enemies while completing a series of objectives. The action is seen from a first-person perspective and the player must traverse the levels while collecting weapons, ammunition, and health. The player can use various weapons, including the classic double-barreled shotgun and the rocket launcher, as well as various power-ups and items. The game features two main modes of play, single-player and co-operative. In single-player, the player must complete levels alone, while in co-operative mode, two players work together to complete levels. In addition to the main modes, Deathmatch is also available, where two players can battle each other in a battle to the death. Final Doom is one of the most revered installments in the Doom series, having garnered positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and intense combat system. It has been cited as an example of a classic first-person shooter, and was influential in the game's genre.

Those two pieces rate as the best and the most sincere works so far played in the “New Beginnings” Festival. \nJanet Beat (“Scotsman”, November 28, 1989)\n\nRostomyan’s Third Symphony-the great popular success of “New Beginnings”- carried its listeners inexorably from its wonderfully atmospheric opening, to the voluptuous, Holywoodish glamour of its heavenly chorus. Jings, I was nearly greetin’ at it, transfixed by the sheer sonic splendor. It had a soul like a calculation. \nMichael Timelty (“Glasgow Herald”, November 29, 1989)\n\nI was most intrigued by the Third Symphony. It is a fascinating work and beautifully composed.\nHarold Hagopian (RCA/Victor BMG producer, 2002)\n\nStepan Rostomyan’s music reflects a synthesis of European and Oriental traditions, In Rostomyan’s music one can hear influences of the ancient Armenian monody; it is very coloristic and religious. His Symphony and some miniatures – for example “The Angeles’” Canticles are popular in the West.\nMark Rais ( “A Special Issue of Leonardo”, USA Volume 24:2, 1991)\n\nThird Symphony of Rostomyan is a genius piece.\nRodion  Shchedrin ( composer June, 2008)\n\nWe have been listening \"Tagh of Angels\" several times, so much we were taken by its tension and strong message.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Symplegades\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Symplegades (; , Symplēgádes) or Clashing Rocks, also known as the Cyanean Rocks, were, according to Greek mythology, a pair of rocks at the Bosphorus that clashed together whenever a vessel went through. They were defeated by Jason and the Argonauts, who would have been lost and killed by the rocks except for Phineus' advice. Jason let a dove fly between the rocks to see exactly how fast they'd have to row to beat the rocks; the dove lost only its tail feathers. The Argonauts rowed mightily to get through and lost only part of the stern ornament. After that, the Symplegades stopped moving permanently.\n\nThe European rock is usually identified with an islet, about  wide and  long, which stands about  off the shore of a village called Rumelifeneri ('Lighthouse of Rumeli’), and is connected to it by a modern concrete jetty. At its highest point, there is an ancient altar known as the Pillar of Pompey, though it has nothing to do with Pompey.  Dionysius of Byzantium mentions a Roman shrine to Apollo on one of the Cyanean Rocks, and the 16th-century French traveller Petrus Gyllius thought the altar was a remnant of that shrine.\n\nThe Asian rock is probably a reef off the Yum Burnu (north of Anadolu Feneri 'Lighthouse of Anatolia'), described by Gyllius:\nThe reef is divided into four rocks above water which, however, are joined below; it is separated from the continent by a narrow channel filled with many stones, by which as by a staircase one can cross the channel with dry feet when the sea is calm; but when the sea is rough, waves surround the four rocks into which I said the reef is divided.  Three of these are low and more or less submerged, but the middle one is higher than the European rock, sloping up to an acute point and roundish right up to its summit; it is splashed by the waves but not submerged and is everywhere precipitous and straight.\n\nNames\n\nThe Romans called them Cyaneae Insulae (\"Blue Islands\"), and in Turkish they are called Öreke Taşı (\"Distaff Rock\" or \"Midwife's Stool\").\n\nIn literature\n\nLord Byron refers to the Symplegades in the concluding stanzas of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage:\n\nThe New Critic I. A. Richards refers to 'Symplegades' in his work Practical Criticism. In Chapter 2, 'Figurative Language', he refers to dangers of misinterpretation in reading poems:\n\"These twin dangers - careless, 'intuitive' reading and prosaic, 'over-literal' reading - are the Symplegades, the 'justling rocks', between which too many ventures into poetry are wrecked.\"\n\nIn his 1961 novel Jason, Henry Treece depicts the Symplegades as icebergs that drifted downriver into the Black Sea.\n\nThe Wandering Rocks\n\nThe Symplegades are sometimes identified with (or confused with) the Planctae () or Wandering Rocks, which are mentioned in the Odyssey and Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica.  In Apollonius's telling, the Symplegades were encountered on the way to the Golden Fleece and the Planctae were encountered on the return voyage.\n\nThe similarities and differences between the Wandering Rocks and the Symplegades have been much debated by scholars, as have potential locations for them.

They were worshiped by the Greek and the Etruscans as divine objects, specifically by the Titan of the winds, Boreas. According to Ancient Greek mythology, the Argo and Jason and the Argonauts had to pass between these rocks during their quest and they were told not to. The Clashing Rocks are first mentioned in Homer's Odyssey, but they are most famously recounted in Apollonius of Rhodes' Jason and the Argonauts. According to the story, when the Argonauts were passing between the islands, the two clashing rocks would come together unexpectedly, leaving a narrow passage through which only an experienced sailor could pass. The Argo was able to pass between the rocks because Hera had enabled a mystical breeze that blew the ship through. The Symplegades were believed to have functioned as a barrier of sorts, acting as a deterrent for ships from entering the Bosporus. For centuries, the rocks were treated with godly reverence and sailors would give offerings to the gods to ask for safe passage. Eventually, the rocks were destroyed by the Greek hero Heracles, who smashed them to allow Jason to pass through without risk of death. Some versions of the story also report that these rocks morphed into two birds of prey that flew away. The Clashing Rocks play an important part in ancient Greek maritime history. In modern days, descendants of the ancient Greeks continue to revere the Symplegades as the symbol of their people's struggle in the face of luck and chance. The modern city of Istanbul still celebrates the rocks' destruction every year with Argonauts folklore festivals and painting competitions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 80996}

The language was mainly spoken by individuals living in the northern part of Patagonia on the Chile-Argentina border and had no written form. The Puelche language was first discovered by Spanish and Portuguese loanwordz by Jesuit priest Bernardino Gil y Taboada in 1797 and the language was subsequently studied by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The language is related to the languages of the Chon, Tehuelche, Teushen and Chonan individuals who share a few linguistic commonalities as demonstrated by Georgy Charinov in 1970. In some cases, words from the Puelche language were adopted into Chilean Spanish, such as the word puelche itself which refers to clothes or something from the north. The Puelche language is a polysynthetic language, meaning words are often composed of multiple numerous components. It also makes use of unique systems of voice and mood to indicate the speaker's attitude. Furthermore, Puelche has a large number of particle words which have been used to refer to specific aspects of life and culture such as games, animals, and plants. Though Puelche is now extinct, its influence can be found in the languages of Mapuche and Araucanian. Though the Puelche language number of speakers has decreased significantly since the 19th century, there are still a few speakers in some communities in Northern Chubut and Río Negro, Argentina. There is still a lack of literature and research related to Puelche, which is why it is often referred to as a “lost” language. Puelche has important historical-cultural relevance in the region. It serves as a bridge between the indigenous Huilliche culture and the Mapuche culture, connecting them to the Southern Cone region. Moreover, it is used to gain insight into the cultures, modes of thinking and traditions of the Huilliche, which can inform modern day cultural practices. Further research about Puelche is necessary to accurately document the lives, customs and history of these individuals. Though the language is now extinct, it will continue to live on through the history and legacy of the Huilliche and their descendants. There is still much that can be learned from the study of Puelche, and the language holds an important place in the larger cultural mosaic of Argentina and Chile that cannot be forgotten.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8225527}

The film follows the adventures of a retired gunfighter (Caan) and a beautiful young woman (Miles) as they travel through the American West in search of the woman's abducted father. Produced on a budget of $2 million, the film was shot on location in California and Wyoming. It was released two months after the death of its star, James Caan, who had already turned it down twice. A box office failure, it received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on its narrative, visuals, and performances. It has since gained a cult following for its honest portrayal of the Wild West and for its subversive themes. The film follows Jed Cooper (James Caan) as he, alongside the beautiful and clever Claire Sandeaux (Miles), search for her father, Amos (McLiam). It quickly becomes apparent that Amos has been kidnapped by a vicious gang of outlaws led by the mysterious El Tigre (Gary Busey). Unbeknownst to the protagonists, El Tigre desperately desires a hidden map that leads to a tremendous fortune in gold. With the help of some amusingly colorful characters, the Western heroes soon find themselves in a race against time to rescue Amos and keep El Tigre's hands off the map. Gone with the West is a beautifully-crafted Western adventure, chock full of action, American landscapes, and an engrossing cast of characters. While the acting performances are hardly modern-day award-worthy, there is still something sincere and honest about them that helps to enchant an old-fashioned Western. Sanders' direction is tight and the cinematography, while simple, conveys with an air of authenticity. At the time of its release, the film had little success and has since flown under the radar, but its cult following has been slowly and steadily growing since its release. By no means a conventional Western, Gone with the West is still a fascinating film, with its farewell to the Wild West and its search for morality in a chaotic world. Despite the fact that it never quite achieved the success it so deserved, it is a timeless western adventure that has much to offer when it comes to its narrative, visuals, and performances.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26018860}

The church's interior was decorated with murals in the 18th century.\n\nWhen James Louis Sobieski attempted to ascend to the Moldavian throne, the monastery was his base of operations. In 1690 it became the headquarters of the Polish Army for all of their operations in Moldavia related to Poland's participation in the War of the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire. Staying at the monastery for several years, the Poles built an extensive network of bastion fortifications which are well preserved to this day. The monastery's popular name, \"Zamca\", likely comes from this period; it is derived from , the Polish word for castle.\n\nBibliography \n\n W. Korsak, J.

It was founded in the 16th century by King Solomon I of Moldavia to serve as a place of worship for Armenian refugees fleeing Ottoman rule. During this time, it was one of the largest and most prosperous Armenian monasteries in the world. Today, the monastery stands as a reminder of this period of history and as a testament to the resilience of the Armenian people. It lies in the town of Suceava, in Bucovina, and is a National Monument of Romania. The monastery was founded by Solomon in 1541 and soon became an important pilgrimage site. It was here that the Armenian refugees who followed their king could receive shelter and take part in religious activities. The monastery was known for its intricate architecture with many buildings and churches covered in paintings, frescos and mosaics depicting religious scenes. The monastery suffered during the 19th century when it was damaged by fire and Turkish rule. During the period of communism, it was almost destroyed and only some of the buildings and artwork managed to survive. After the revolution of 1989, the monastery was renovated, with new frescos and mosaics added. Today, the monastery is a popular tourist destination and a place of worship for Armenians. It encompasses several churches and buildings including the main church of St. Apostles, an Armenian museum and library, an old printing house and several cultural buildings. It is open to visitors every day and hosts a variety of cultural and religious events throughout the year.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Michelstadt\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Michelstadt () in the Odenwald is a town in the Odenwaldkreis (district) in southern Hesse, Germany between Darmstadt and Heidelberg. It has a population of around 16,000.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation \nMichelstadt is the biggest town in the Odenwaldkreis and borders on the district seat of Erbach.\n\nNeighbouring municipalities \nMichelstadt borders in the north on the municipality of Brombachtal, the town of Bad König and the municipality of Lützelbach, in the east on the town of Klingenberg, the market municipalities of Laudenbach and Kleinheubach, the town of Miltenberg, the market municipality of Weilbach, the town of Amorbach and the market municipality of Kirchzell (all seven in Miltenberg district in Bavaria), in the south on the town of Erbach, and in the west on the municipalities of Mossautal and Reichelsheim.\n\nConstituent communities \nMichelstadt's Stadtteile, besides the main town, also called Michelstadt, are Rehbach, Steinbach, Steinbuch, Stockheim, Vielbrunn, Weiten-Gesäß and Würzberg.\n\nHistory \nThe first documentary mention of Michelstadt is from 741, noted by Carloman, who was Charlemagne’s uncle and Mayor of the Palace.<ref>Dictionary of Literary Biography, volume 148, German Writers and Works of the Early Middle Ages: 800-1170, edited by James Hardin and Will Hasty, 1994, pp. 27-31.</ref>\n\nMichelstadt is one of the oldest settlements in the inner Odenwald. Its castle grew out of a Frankish baronial estate. This was built into a refuge for the local inhabitants. As a royal estate, Prince Carloman donated it in 741 to Saint Boniface’s pupil Burchard, the first Bishop of Würzburg. This donation was apparently meant for Bishop Burchard personally, for the Michelnstat area passed back to the Frankish Crown upon Burchard’s death in 791.\n\nIn 815, the Michlinstat area was donated once again. In recognition of his great merit as confidant at Charlemagne’s court, Einhard acquired the main town and all land within two leagues (roughly 15 km) from Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, as a freehold. Einhard also built the Einhardsbasilika. In 819, he bequeathed his Odenwald holdings to Lorsch Abbey and in so doing precisely defined the boundaries of the Mark Michelstadt. Upon Einhard’s death on 14 March 840, the monastery came into its inheritance.\n\nIn the 17th century, the first houses outside the town wall were built. In 1773, a new town gate was built, called the Neutor' (“New Gate”). In the 19th century, the gate towers were all torn down one after the other.\n\nIn 1806, Michelstadt, as within the County of Erbach, passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.\n\nThe building of the railway line and its completion through to Darmstadt in 1870 and then Eberbach in 1881 brought Michelstadt a sharp economic upswing. Out of what was once a small farming community grew a sizeable town with important industrial operations on the foundation of the centuries-old ironworking. A new economic era began. From the clothweavers’ and dyers’ guild grew a cloth factory; from foundries grew machine factories. Ivory carving was a starting point for businesses in the souvenir industry and plastics processing.\n\nIn 1962, the town hosted the second Hessentag state festival.\n\nIn 2007, a decision to merge the town with the neighbouring town of Erbach was thwarted by a civic vote.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe municipal elections held 2006 and 2016 yielded the following results:\n\nMayor \nList of elected mayors of Michelstadt:\n1997–2009: Reinhold Ruhr\n2009–2021: Stephan Kelbert\n2021–incumbent: Tobias Robischon\n\nTown partnerships \n Rumilly, Haute-Savoie, France\n Hulst, Zeelandic Flanders, Netherlands\n\nCoat of arms \n\nThe town's arms might be described as per fess azure two mullets.\n\nMichelstadt was granted these arms in 1541 along with its new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. The diapering in the lower half of the escutcheon is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it. The mullets (six-pointed star shapes) come from the Counts' arms, but why the parting per fess (horizontal division across the middle) was chosen is a mystery. Except for diapering, the arms have not changed since the 16th century.\n\nEconomy\n\nNotable companies \n Mühlhäuser, a manufacturer of railbound and trackless tunnel construction equipment.\n\nArts and culture\n\nTheatre \nKleinkunstbühne Patat (cabaret)\nMichelstädter Theatersommer, yearly open-air plays in the historic Kellereihof\nTheaterkarren e.V.

E. Lichtigfeld-Museum (State Rabbi Lichtigfeld)\nPrivates Elfenbeinmuseum Ulrich Seidenberg (private ivory museum)\nMotorrad-Museum (motorcycles)\n\nBuildings\nMichelstadt's Old Town features many timber-frame houses. Particularly worthy of mention are the following buildings, some within the old town, others in the surrounding countryside: The historic Town Hall, the Diebsturm (\"Thief's Tower\") at the town wall, the Kellereihof (a Frankish, early mediaeval castle complex refurbished in an early Renaissance style) in the town wall ring, the late Gothic town church (late 13th century), the Einhards-Basilika, the palace of the Counts at Erbach-Fürstenau (Schloss Fürstenau, within which are parts of an old moated castle in Michelstadt-Steinbach), Jagdschloss Eulbach with an English landscape garden and a Roman bath and castra, formerly part of the Neckar-Odenwald Limes.\n\nHistoric Town Hall \n\nMichelstadt's timber-frame town hall, whose image was used on a Deutsche Post stamp, was built in 1484 in the late Gothic style and later remodelled on the inside many times; from 1743 to 1903 it was covered in shakes. The town hall's main floor served from the beginning as a market hall, and was built using jettying. The back (east) wall was originally part of the graveyard wall, upon which the ground floor's upper bressumer was laid. To this day it is unknown who the master builder was, although it is assumed that the driving force behind the project could have been Schenk Adolar von Erbach and Bishop Johann von Dalberg (his adviser).\n\nLate Gothic town church \nThe town church, completed in 1490, was built to replace a Carolingian stone church by Einhard, itself built on the site of a former wooden church. The nave's columns and the two aisles' walls were built in 1475. The quire dates from 1461; the antechoir's north wall is even older – Carolingian. Until the 1970s, the church housed one of the most valuable libraries in Germany in its belltower containing more than a thousand volumes belonging to Michelstadt-born Nicolaus Matz, who was capitular in Speyer, and who bequeathed this collection to his hometown and its citizens in the late 14th century. Since the 1970s the library has been housed in a storehouse specially converted for it at the Michelstadt coaching inn that belonged to the Thurn und Taxis noble family, who played a key rôle in European postal services in the 16th century. The former church on this spot was built over a brook that comes up here, called the Kiliansfloß, an early Celtic-Germanic worship site and later a Roman Mithraic worship site. The thus channelled Kiliansfloß fed not only the baptismal font, but also all the town's fountains. The Kiliansfloß, however, does not actually rise here, but rather far outside the town. It then disappears into the ground not far from the graveyard, springing up again in the middle of town.\n\nEinhard's Basilica in the outlying centre of Steinbach\n\nThe Einhards-Basilika was built by Einhard, Charlemagne's chronicler and confidant. The Carolingian church built between 824 and 827 is one of the very few Carolingian buildings that have survived largely intact. The Basilica's crypt once housed Saints Peter's and Marcellinus's relics, which had been stolen from Rome on Einhard's instructions by his notary Ratleik. His servants' nightmares and the remains' \"sweating blood\" there, however, made Einhard think that this arrangement did not feel right. He thus transferred himself, his wife, the relics and his seat to Ober-Mulinheim am Main, now known as Seligenstadt, which thereby became a pilgrimage site with a new, larger basilica.\n\nThe story that has been handed down says that the relics hidden from Rome were transported to Saint-Maurice-en-Valais, now in Switzerland, whence they were then brought to Michelstadt by a cheering pilgrimage procession.\n\nThe Basilica in Steinbach was converted, expanded, and rededicated many times and later served first as a hospital and then in the 17th century as a barn. Once it was rediscovered in 1873 as being Carolingian, the exploration and safeguarding of the parts of the basilica that were still intact began.\n\nThe Einhards-Basilika was until 1967 owned by the princely Counts of Erbach-Fürstenau. The grounds are now owned by the state of Hesse.\n\nThe palace of the Counts of Erbach-Fürstenau in the outlying centre of Steinbach \n\nThe palace complex is a series of building styles which includes remains of the old Electorate of Mainz border fortifications and moated castle (about 1300) on the north side to the Gothic works by the stonecutters who came from Strasbourg to Steinbach, to the gigantic Renaissance-style gateway arch (1588) between the moated castle's two western corner towers which replaced the castle wall and opened the gloomy, dank courtyard back up to the former castle garden, to the Renaissance palace mill, a former mint (today a run-of-the-river hydroelectric station), to the Baroque Kavaliershaus (a palace outbuilding for staff and guests) on the Mümling, to the Neoclassical residential wing, the Neues Palais (1810/11) and the late Baroque orangery in the palace park, which was built in the English style. The orangery's upper floor housed the small palace theatre.\n\nSchloss Fürstenau is still a dwelling, with the head of the house of the princely Counts of Erbach-Fürstenau and his family still living there. The former Electorate of Mainz defence facility lay on the property of the Schenk of Erbach (a forefather of the noble family, which at that time had not yet branched) and passed into his ownership in 1355. Public access to the ground and is possible by day. At the outer bailey with its gateway arch from 1765 some visual artists have taken up residence (in among other places the former stables from after 1765).\n\nRoman bath and castra \nRight near Würzberg, in the middle of a clearing are found the remains of the Roman Castrum of Würzberg, which was built about AD 100 as part of the Neckar-Odenwald-Limes, and was used for about 60 years before the border was shifted farther east. The castrum can only be made out by an earthen wall. The Roman bathhouse, on the other hand, which stands right next to the castrum, has been partially restored; the floors have been replaced and the wall has been built back up to a height of about a metre. Despite the bath's small size, which was only meant for the fort's 120-man garrison, the design of a Roman bathhouse is easily recognizable.\n\nNot far from the outlying centre of Vielbrunn, in the area around the former hunting palace of the Princes of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, traces of the Castrum of Hainhaus can still be found. Furthermore, on Michelstadt's eastern outskirts can be found the Castrum of Eulbach near the Eulbacher Park, a landscaped English park from the early 19th century with its hunting palace and an adjoining wildlife park.\n\nOther structures \n Würzberg Transmission Mast\n ESOC-Bodenstation Michelstadt (disused satellite ground receiving station)\n\nRegular events \nMichelstädter Bienenmarkt (\"bee market\") – Held each year at Whitsun, it was started by former mayor Hasenzahl in 1954.\nMusiknacht – Each year, various concert productions take place in the Old Town with many different kinds of music.\nChurch Consecration Festival with Weinbrunnenfest – From the Old Town's many fountains, wine is given out by the many wine cellars and businesses at the Weinbrunnenfest (\"Wine Fountain Festival\"), which is actually Michelstadt's traditional folk festival, at which all the town's countless fountains are decorated.\nMichelstadt Christmas Market – this is still quite a new creation of the television-sponsored Stadtmarketing (\"town marketing\") of the late 1960s. The opening always takes place on the Friday before the onset of Advent. \nMichelstädter Theatersommer – since 2003 a yearly open-air theatrical festival, initiated by the Michelstadt \"theatremakers\" Alexander Kaffenberger and Dirk Daniel Zucht.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTransport \nIn Michelstadt the two Bundesstraßen 45 and 47 intersect, both are old trade roads from Frankfurt am Main to Augsburg and from Worms to Würzburg respectively.\n\nThe town is served by a railway station on the Odenwaldbahn (RMV Line 65; Eberbach – Erbach – Michelstadt – Darmstadt – Frankfurt / Hanau). Regionalbahn, Stadtexpress and Regionalexpress trains of the VIAS GmbH stop here.\n\nThere is also the special landing facility Flugplatz Michelstadt (airfield), which lies roughly 2 km from the town and is run by a club.\n\nEducation \n Stadtschule Michelstadt (primary school)\n Schule am Hollerbusch (primary school)\n Einhardschule (primary school in the outlying centre of Steinbach)\n Grundschule Vielbrunn (primary school)\n Theodor Litt Schule (Realschule and Hauptschule)\n Gymnasium Michelstadt\n Odenwaldkreis Vocational Schools (including, among others, Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule and Berufliches Gymnasium, nowadays known as BSO – Europaschule.\n\nNotable people \n Rolf Beck (born 1945), music conductor\n Dietrich Schenk von Erbach (d. 1459), Archbishop of Mainz (from 1434 to 1459)\n Hartmut Barth-Engelbart (pen names include Carl Hanau and HaBE, (b. 1947), author, songwriter and graphic artist\n Rebecca Horn (b. 1944), artist, film director\n Fritz Kredel (b. 8 February 1900 in Michelstadt, d. 11 June 1973 in New York), artist and graphic designer\n Gabriele von Lutzau (b. 1954), sculptor, lives and works in Michelstadt\n Alfred Maul (1870 - 1942), engineer, considered the father of aerial reconnaissance\n Dirk Mommertz (born 1974), pianist and chamber musician\n Otto Rahn (1904 - 1939),  writer, medievalist, Ariosophist, SS officer\n Stefan Seeger (b. 1962), chemist, university professor and entrepreneur\n Jessica Schwarz (b. 1977), moderator and actress\n Carl Weyprecht (1838 - 1881), explorer\n Seckel Löb Wormser (b. 1768 in Michelstadt, d. 1847 in Michelstadt), Kabbalist\n\nFurther reading \n Wolfgang Hartmann: Zu den frühen urkundlichen Erwähnungen von Michelstadt im Odenwald.

Domb and his older brother, Peter, embarked on a series of odd jobs from a young age, shining shoes, shoveling snow, and mowing lawns. He graduated from Fort Lee High School in 1973 and started college at American University in Washington, D.C. Domb took evening classes there and worked full-time selling security systems for Phelps Time Lock Service in Hyattsville, Maryland. He graduated in 1977 with a marketing degree and continued to work for Phelps, being transferred to Philadelphia to manage the company's office in that city.\n\nBusiness career\nTo earn extra money while managing the Phelps office, Domb earned a real estate license at Temple University. As the real estate business became more profitable, he quit the security business job and sold real estate full time, opening his own office in 1983. Domb specialized in real estate near Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square and soon became well-known among property buyers and sellers in that neighborhood. He was elected president of the Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors (GPAR) in 1990, the youngest president that organization had ever elected. After success in real estate sales, Domb expanded into real estate development in 1999, and worked with restaurateur Stephen Starr to develop restaurants in Philadelphia.\n\nDomb was again elected president of the GPAR in 2013, by which time he had acquired the nickname \"Philly Condo King.\" In his second term as GPAR president, he worked with Mayor Michael Nutter and the city government on ideas to collect delinquent property taxes and attract new residents to the city. He also worked with City Council President Darrell L. Clarke to determine the market value and ultimate disposition of some of the city's inactive school buildings. Even after entering politics, Domb remained active in the real estate business, purchasing a 19-story office building in April 2016.\n\nPolitical career\nNutter was term-limited, so the office of mayor would be open in the 2015 election. Domb, a registered independent, was said to be \"testing the waters\" as a possibly independent or Republican candidate for mayor. Instead, in May of that year, Domb announced he would run as a Democrat for one of the city's seven at-large council seats. Pledging some of his vast personal wealth to the cause, Domb described his goals in office: \"We will talk about collecting taxes from out-of-state landlords and using that money to fund our schools. New job training programs. And partnering with our universities to mentor our children.\"\n\nIn the primary election that month, Domb placed third, winning one of the five Democratic nominations. In the general election in the majority-Democratic city, Domb again placed third, earning a seat on the council. In office, Domb continued to search for solution to the city's large number of tax-delinquent properties.\n\nSee also\nList of members of Philadelphia City Council since 1952\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n1955 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Fort Lee, New Jersey\nBusinesspeople from Jersey City, New Jersey\nAmerican University alumni\nAmerican real estate businesspeople\nTemple University alumni\nBusinesspeople from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania Democrats\nPhiladelphia City Council members\nPoliticians from Jersey City, New Jersey\nFort Lee High School alumni", "machine_text": " Allan Domb (born March 21, 1956) is an American real estate investment, development and asset management entrepreneur who has become a staple in Philadelphia's commercial and residential real estate markets.

In 1983, Ronstadt changed musical directions towards big band jazz and traditional pop music, recording What's New, which was certified Triple Platinum in the United States. It was succeeded by 1984's Lush Life and 1986's For Sentimental Reasons (both Platinum-certified).\n\nTo celebrate her Mexican American heritage, Ronstadt recorded the Spanish-language album Canciones de Mi Padre in 1987, which sold more than two million copies in the U.S. and won Ronstadt another Grammy Award.  It stands as the best-selling non-English language record in U.S. music history. The same year, she also teamed with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton for the collaborative album Trio, which spawned four Top 10 country music hits, including the number 1 single, \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\".

It employs 23% of the Filipino workforce , according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Philippines is one of the most vulnerable agricultural systems to monsoons and other extreme weather events, which are expected to create more uncertainty as climate change effects the Philippines. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization has described the local policy measures as some of the most proactive in risk reduction.\n\nHistory\n\nProfession\n\nGrains\n\nRice \n\nThe Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. The Philippines was also the world's largest rice importer in 2010. In 2010, nearly 15.7 million metric tons of palay (pre-husked rice) were produced. In 2010, palay accounted for 21.86% percent of gross value added in agriculture and 2.37% of GNP. Self-sufficiency in rice reached 88.93% in 2015.\n\nRice production in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1950s. Improved varieties of rice developed during the Green Revolution, including at the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines have improved crop yields. Crop yields have also improved due to increased use of fertilizers. Average productivity increased from 1.23 metric tons per hectare in 1961 to 3.59 metric tons per hectare in 2009.\n\nHarvest yields have increased significantly by using foliar fertilizer (Rc 62 -> 27% increase, Rc 80 -> 40% increase, Rc 64 -> 86% increase) based on PhilRice National Averages.\n\nThe government has been promoting the production of Golden rice.\n\nThe table below shows some of the agricultural products of the country per region.\n\nCorn/maize\n\nCorn/maize is the second most important crop in the Philippines.  600,000 farm households are employed in different businesses in the corn value chain. , around  of land is under corn cultivation and the total production was . The government has been promoting Bt corn for hardiness against insects and higher yields.\n\nOther food crops\n\nChocolate\n\nCoffee\n\nCoconuts \n\nCoconuts plays an important role in the national economy of the Philippines. According to figures published in December 2015 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's largest producer of coconuts, producing 19,500,000 tonnes in 2015. Production in the Philippines is generally concentrated in medium-sized farms. There are 3.5 million hectares dedicated to coconut production in the Philippines, which accounts for 25 per cent of total agricultural land in the country. In 1989, it was estimated that between 25 percent and 33 percent of the population was at least partly dependent on coconuts for their livelihood. Historically, the Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas were the centers of coconut production. In the 1980s, Western Mindanao and Southern Mindanao also became important coconut-growing regions.\n\nFruits\n\nThe Philippines is the world's third largest producer of pineapples, producing more than 2.4 million of tonnes in 2015. The Philippines was in the top three banana producing countries in 2010, including India and China. Davao and Mindanao contribute heavily to the total national banana crop. Mangoes are the third most important fruit crop of the country based on export volume and value next to bananas and pineapples.\n\nSugar \n\nThere are at least 19 provinces and 11 regions that produce sugarcane in the Philippines. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07%; and Eastern Visayas by 04%. It is estimated that , the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar producing provinces.\n\nSugar growing in the Philippines pre-dates colonial Spanish contact. Sugar became the most important agricultural export of the Philippines between the late eighteenth century and the mid-1970s. During the 1950s and 60s, more than 20 percent income of Philippine exports came from the sugar industry. Between 1913 and 1974, the Philippines sugar industry enjoyed favoured terms of trade with the US, with special access to the protected and subsidized the American sugar market.\n\nAnimal agriculture\n\nCrocodile\n\nOstrich\n\nOther crops\n\nAbaca \n\nAccording to the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority, the Philippines provided 87.4% of the world's abaca in 2014, earning the Philippines US$111.33 million.  The demand is still greater than the supply.  The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%).  The Bicol region in the Philippines produced 27,885 metric tons of abaca in 2014, the largest of any Philippine region.  The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009–2013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca production while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes Island. Eastern Visayas, the second largest producer had 24% and the Davao Region, the third largest producer had 11% of the total production.  Around 42 percent of the total abaca fiber shipments from the Philippines went to the United Kingdom in 2014, making it the top importer.  Germany imported 37.1 percent abaca pulp from the Philippines, importing around 7,755 metric tons (MT).  Sales of abaca cordage surged 20 percent in 2014 to a total of 5,093 MT from 4,240 MT, with the United States holding around 68 percent of the market.\n\nRubber\n\nThere are an estimated 458,000 families dependent upon the cultivation of rubber trees.

Along with fishing and forestry, it provides the bulk of the food and other necessities. Agricultural products such as rice, corn, beef, chicken, and pork make up the majority of the Filipino population’s daily meals. Most farms in the Philippines are small-scale and family-owned, with a few larger commercial operations. Fruits and vegetables are also important crops, and coconut, banana, mango, and pineapple are especially plentiful. The region's climate is tropical and typically favors agriculture. The Philippines is known for its abundance of land, including numerous rivers and wide plains, enabling farmers to cultivate and harvest plants for commercial sale. Many of the soil’s nutrients have been depleted due to over-farming, making it necessary to use fertilizers and water conservation methods in order to maximize yield. Despite its potential, production in the Philippines remains limited due to a number of factors, such as lack of investment in new technologies, insufficient infrastructure and agricultural extension services, and the prevalence of poverty. Further development of irrigation systems, research facilities, and technical training programs could help increase crop yields and promote progressive farming practices. The government of the Philippines has recently implemented a number of initiatives to boost agricultural production and help the farming sector become more competitive. This includes providing subsidies to farmers, establishing crop insurance and microfinance, and creating a modern market system. Additionally, the government has provided extension services and better access to technology to encourage more production. Agriculture in the Philippines remains essential to providing food and employment for its citizens. While the sector faces considerable challenges, the recent interventions of the government will hopefully lead to sustained growth in the near future. With increased investment and technical assistance, the Philippines can become a major producer of agricultural products and competitive in the global market.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15948510}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank McDonough\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank McDonough is a British historian of the Third Reich and international history.\n\nLife\n\nFrancis [Frank] Xavier McDonough was born on 17 April 1957 in Liverpool. He read modern History at Balliol College, Oxford, as a Senior Status Scholar. He was at Balliol at the same time as Boris Johnson and knew him. He later earned a PhD in history from Lancaster University, under the supervision of Ruth Henig. He was Professor of International History in the History Department of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Liverpool John Moores University until his retirement in 2021. He is an avid Liverpool F.C. fan and still lives in Liverpool with his partner Ann.\n\nWork\nHis key area of research is international history, particularly Anglo-German relations in the 20th century. He has published significant works on the origins of World War I and World War II. McDonough is increasingly publishing his research on the Third Reich, including opposition to Hitler, the Holocaust and the Gestapo.\n\nNeville Chamberlain and appeasement\n\nIn his study of Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, published in 1998, McDonough outlined a 'post revisionist' theory, which built on the work of R. A. C. Parker's 1994 book Chamberlain and Appeasement, by expanding it to include appeasement in society and looking at economic appeasement, the mass media and the opponents of appeasement. McDonough accepted that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but unlike the revisionists he argued that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. He suggested that appeasement must be analysed as a usable policy at the time it operated and focus on how Chamberlain's personality played a crucial role in the conduct of the policy, in particular, his errors of judgement, his failure to listen to opponents and his unwillingness to try any alternatives. McDonough argues that Chamberlain's version of appeasement, as operated by such an inflexible politician, unwilling to change direction, until events forced him to, actually contributed to Britain and France entering the war in 1939 in a much weaker strategic position, and passed the early advantage in the war to Hitler's regime, which meant that Germany only faced one European front until June 1944.\n\nThe study was reviewed in academic journals. Parker described it as \"very well written, with a lively argument, which explores appeasement in society too\". Andrew Thorpe, a leading authority on foreign affairs, described the book as \"a cogent and stimulating analysis of appeasement which will take the debate still deeper\". A leading US historian of foreign affairs from the Reed College, Edward B. Segel, commented: \"The book brings out effectively how the British government manipulated the mass-media, the press and especially the BBC to exclude public criticism of Chamberlain's policies and convey the impression of overwhelming support\".\n\nMcDonough is one of the most prominent 'post-revisionist' experts on Neville Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement, along with Parker, who was, as Sydney Aster points out, his \"academic mentor while he was at Oxford\".\n\nOther books\n\nIn McDonough's 2007 monograph, The Conservative Party and Anglo-German Relations, 1905–1914, published by Palgrave Macmillan, he moved the focus of analysis to the Conservative Party's role in the outbreak of the First World War. The study was described in a review in the journal The Bulletin of the German Institute of Historical Research by a German foreign policy scholar as \"a thorough and thought-provoking analysis, which draws on over thirty archives and provides a powerful and overdue corrective to the traditional depiction of the Edwardian Conservative Party as 'Scaremongers' and the chief promoters of Germanophobic views among British political parties in the years that led to the outbreak of the First World War\".\n\nIn addition, to his research on Anglo-German relations, McDonough has written a number of publications on the related subject of the history of the Third Reich, most notably, Hitler and Nazi Germany (1999); Opposition and Resistance in Nazi Germany (2001); and Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party (2003).\n\nAmong his other books are: The Origins of the First and Second World Wars (1997); The British Empire, 1815–1914 (1994); and Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement (2002). In 1998, McDonough was commissioned by the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations Board to write a set text entitled Fascism, Conflict and Communism: European History: 1890–1945.\n\nIn recent years, McDonough's published work has been focused on aspects of the history of the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2008, McDonough published The Holocaust, with John Cochrane. This book is a new introduction to both the events and the complex international response to the Holocaust and examines the grim reality of life and death in the death camps, the scholarly debates and the impact on popular culture since 1945 of the most horrific aspect of the history of the 20th century.\n\nMcDonough is the author of an English-language biography of the German resistance heroine, Sophie Scholl, entitled Sophie Scholl: The Woman Who Defied Hitler, published by the History Press in February 2009.\n\nIn September 2011, McDonough published The Origins of the Second World War: An international Perspective, about the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn April 2012, the second edition of \"Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party\" was published.\n\nIn August 2015, McDonough's study The Gestapo: The Myth and Reality of Hitler's Secret Police was published by the Hodder and Stoughton imprint Coronet. The book is based on original Gestapo files and tells the story of the victims of Nazi Terror. The book has been published in translated versions in Italy (March 2016), Spain (June 2016), Norway (August 2016), Sweden (September 2016), Finland (2016) and Romania (2019).\n\nThe paperback version of the Gestapo book was released in September 2016 \n\nMcDonough has most recently completed a two volume book titled 'The Hitler Years'. The first volume (Triumph 1933–1939) is due to be published on 14 November 2019.\n\nMedia appearances and Twitter\nMcDonough has also appeared on TV and radio. He appeared on CrossTalk on Russia Today in 2010, debating whether the Second World War could have been prevented. He featured in the BBC 1 documentary A Tale of Two Rival Cities, which was part of the BBC's \"History of the World\" project, for which he also acted as Historical Consultant; the documentary won a Royal Television Society Award. He was interviewed in two special programmes on French National Television to mark the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's 18 June 1940 speech when he said the \"flame of French Resistance cannot be extinguished\". McDonough appeared as an historical commentator on France 2 and in a special documentary featuring historians on de Gaulle, broadcast on France 3 on 18 June 2010. He also appeared in the BBC 1 programme Inside Out commenting on a story presented by the actor Paul McGann that looked at whether or not Adolf Hitler visited Liverpool between November 1911 and May 1912. McDonough argued that evidence from Austrian police records, eyewitness accounts from Vienna, and shipping records all strongly indicated that the young Hitler had lived in Vienna at this time, not Liverpool, thus confirming what Hitler claimed in his autobiography, Mein Kampf. In 2012, McDonough appeared in a series on the history of the Third Reich on National Geographic channel entitled Nazi Secrets. He appeared in three episodes: \"Hitler's Damned Women\", \"Hitler's Family Skeletons\" and \"Hitler's Millions\". In November 2013, McDonough was featured in a BBC 1 documentary called The Story of the Swastika and a Channel 5 documentary called 7 Days That Made the Führer. In 2014, McDonough appeared in a 10-part documentary series called The Rise of the Nazi Party on Quest TV, part of the Discovery Channel.\n\nMcDonough has a Twitter account called @FXMC1957. It examines key facts in history every morning. McDonough often does Twitter lectures that cover issues such as the JFK assassination, D-Day and the outbreak of WW1 in great depth. He rarely tweets much about his work, his private life or his opinions. The History News Network ranked McDonough's Twitter in the Top 20 History Twitter accounts.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Professor Frank McDonough's official website\n \n \n \"Adolf Hitler Liverpool links discussed in new BBC documentary\", Liverpool Echo, 28 November 2011\n\nLiving people\n1957 births\nHistorians of Nazism\nEnglish historians\nAcademics of Liverpool John Moores University\nAlumni of Balliol College, Oxford\nAlumni of Lancaster University\nAcademics from Liverpool", "machine_text": " Frank McDonough (born 1940) is an English historian, historian of film and former reference librarian.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Madness Under the Royal Palms\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Madness Under The Royal Palms - Love and Death in Palm Beach is a book by author Laurence Leamer, published by Hyperion, and released on January 20, 2009.\n\nOverview\nThe book is a historical and anthropological study of Palm Beach, Florida, the social cliques and special interests; and biographies of some of the notable residents who, according to Leamer, represent the Palm Beach experience.\n\nPalm Beach is an island to the East of West Palm Beach, connected to the mainland by a series of bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway.\nIt is also a social island and shares little resemblance with the mainland. It is home to some of the wealthiest families in the world, including Donald Trump and a high density of billionaires.\n\nDescription\nBestselling author Laurence Leamer spent the winter season in Palm Beach for over a decade, witnessing from his front row seat the inner workings of this exclusive enclave.  In Madness Under the Royal Palms: Love and Death Behind the Gates of Palm Beach, Leamer takes readers inside the parties and the clubs, behind the doors of the toniest addresses and into the scandals and the tragedies of some of the wealthiest families in the country.  He captures the clash between old money and new, religion and status, and the love, lust, and fatal hatreds that determine the shape of that fiercely protected society.\n\nMadness Under The Royal Palms has generated a firestorm of controversy including supposed threats against Leamer’s life and confrontations on the streets of Palm Beach recorded by a news camera \n\nLeamer has put the whole matter in context most notably in a lengthy interview for WGBH Public Television in Boston\n\nPalm Beach Under a Microscope\nIn Madness Under the Royal Palms, Leamer, best known for his bestsellers including The Kennedy Women, looks at the way wealth makes its own rules and how it creates a culture of privilege untouched by the rules governing most Americans. He was given unprecedented access to the tightly controlled hierarchy in Palm Beach’s coveted inner sanctums. He reveals the lives of the men and women who have come to this exclusive island off the coast of Florida with big ambitions and even larger checkbooks. He covers the hotly contested memberships in the “right” clubs to the rise of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago which leveled long-standing barriers with its glitz and celebration of new glamour. He hilariously writes about the architecture wars -— when the high social value of buying one of the “grand old” homes shifted to knocking those old houses down and the race to build mega-mansions in their place.  And he captures the uneasy alliances that fuel marriages -– including the successive trophy wives – to the rancorous and even fatal divorces.\n\nLeamer’s Madness Under the Royal Palms shows that money cannot buy happiness. As Leamer writes, “in Palm Beach, people chased after happiness, but like dogs chasing a mechanical rabbit in a greyhound race, no matter how fast they ran, happiness was just a few inches in front of their noses.”\n\nLessons From The Book\nIn the end, Leamer’s tale reveals a darker strain. As he discovers the desperate hunger a billionaire has for acceptance that may never come, or the aging beauty’s struggle to redefine and keep a place in this society, he also captures a pathos and humanity in many of his subjects. There are characters that range from the doyenne of the modern drawing room who forgoes a marriage with family attending and flies to New Zealand so that Prince Philip and Prince Edward might be present instead; the skinflint billionaire who kidnaps his first children, rewrites his own history, and then plots spectacularly against his fifth wife with a prenuptial that would have her paying him if she leaves; to the small-town daughter of a cop who becomes the gatekeeper for it all, the society columnist for the local newspaper.\n\nControversy following Madoff scandal\nThe Bernard Madoff scandal put Leamer's book centerstage, as Madoff was a trusted Member of the wealthy Jewish community. According to Leamer, Madoff had made inroads to the Jewish elite of Boston, who unwittingly vouched for him after he gained their trust. Many members of the Palm Beach Jewish Community were wiped out by Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and this has purportedly generated a lot of resentment for Leamer, who has been publicly speaking on the particular impact the scandal has had on the Palm Beach community.\n\nOther Controversies\nThe author created a row in Palm Beach when he accused the Society Editor of the Palm Beach Daily News, Shannon Donnelly, of receiving a gift (or gifts) from a wealthy socialite in exchange for coverage that would elevate the resident's social status. The newspaper has defended Donnelly, and the allegations were investigated and deemed to be unfounded. Publisher Joyce Reingold has criticized Madness Under The Royal Palms of inaccuracies, although specific examples were not made.\n\nAs a result of the book's popularity, Leamer has been interviewed by numerous media associations, and has openly discussed touchy subjects including the social psychology of the Island's Jewish community, anti-Semitism among the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs), the \"old money\" disdain for new money, including resident and Mar-a-Lago owner Donald Trump, and a tiered caste-type system among the wealthy as reflected in the exclusive clubs.\n\nLeamer discusses the social scene and the backgrounds of the Island's high society clubs including the Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach Country Club and the Bath & Tennis Club. In his book, he claims that the elite organizations have very exclusive and discriminating acceptance policies. As a response to Leamer's portrayal of the Palm Beach Country Club, a place where Leamer says he had often been invited as a dinner guest, Leamer claims he was blacklisted from ever entering the Club. Leamer has not specifically criticized the Palm Beach Jewish Community, but many members have expressed outrage over his comments and have interpreted his words as an ethnic attack. The author has responded by stating that he is also a Palm Beach resident, with many close Jewish friends and associates; his description of the social structure, he claims, are anthropological and social observations that are common knowledge among the local community. Leamer pays many accolades to the philanthropic contributions of the Palm Beach Jewish Community both in his book and in the subsequent interviews. In his WGBH interview, Leamer stated that Bernard Madoff's impact on charities is a testimony to the charitable benefactors in the Jewish community. Had many of the Madoff investors not been Jewish, according to Leamer, the charities would not have felt such an impact. In the interview, Leamer spoke very highly of the intellectual Jewish Community of Boston, who represented a large number of the Jewish elite in Palm Beach.\n\nExternal links\n The official website of Madness Under The Royal Palms]\n The blog by New York Times bestselling author, Laurence Leamer\n NBC affiliate WPTV Channel 5 exclusive video on Madness Under The Royal Palms]\n Laurence Leamer interview with WGBH Boston public television over his article in Boston Magazine\nBoston Magazine article \"Reversal of Fortune\" by Laurence Leamer\n\nAmerican non-fiction books\n2009 non-fiction books\nPalm Beach, Florida", "machine_text": " \"Madness Under the Royal Palms\" is a 2015 American drama film directed by Michael Davis and written by Cynthia Lowen.

She was deafened after a bout of scarlet fever at age sixteen.\n\nWashburn returned to her public high school and graduated with her class. She attended Butler College in Indianapolis through her sophomore year in 1889. She struggled to adjust to college life and communicate with teachers and other students; she took lessons in lipreading and learned to use her residual hearing to the best of her ability.\n\nArt education and career\n\nWashburn took courses in drawing and commercial art in Cincinnati, then moved to Chicago. After traveling to Europe to study artistic classics, she began attending the Art Institute of Chicago. At the Art Institute, she studied under Lorado Taft and Charles Mulligan. She spent many evenings practicing anatomy drawings in the library and sketching skeletons and musculature models in the art studios.\n\nHer first commissioned work was a sculpture of Union Civil War general Robert H. Milroy in her hometown of Rensselaer; the statue stands at the former site of his homestead. Many exhibits followed at the Art Institute and at exhibitions in Chicago, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and other cities. Washburn decided to resign from taking commercial art orders so she could focus on sculpture.\n\nWashburn created the Waite Memorial for Charles Burlingame Waite and Catharine Van Valkenburg Waite after his death in 1909. Located at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., the memorial features a bronze bust of Charles and a circular bronze relief portrait of Catharine. During a third visit to Paris, Washburn studied under master sculptor Edwin Sawyer, learning to sculpt medals and medallions.

The BC Liberals will remain a strong opposition, and Andrew Weaver remains the leader of the Green Party. The formation of the legislature is unique due to BC being the only province in Canada with a minority government lead by the NDP. The Greens decided to support the NDP to form a confidence and supply agreement; meaning they will supply and guarantee the confidence of the legislature. This put Andrew Weaver and the Green Party in an anomalous position of holding the balance of power despite only having a single seat in the Legislative Assembly. The 42nd Parliament will place a strong focus on the environment and sustainable economic growth. Notable pieces of legislation include the CleanBC Plan designed to reduce emissions and greenhouse gasses, banning corporate, union and third-party contributions and an agreement between BC and Alberta to establish a local transportation corridor for the proposed Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline. Other legislation tabled has been in regards to increasing affordable housing, improving public health and safety, increasing access to post-secondary education and creating more jobs. Most notably, the BC NDP also tabled the Province’s first gender-based budget to focus on ending gender inequality.

He is a former physics professor at San Diego State University, and has helped to popularize science on the Discovery Channel. He is the author of a number of physics-themed books including Taking the Quantum Leap (1981), The Dreaming Universe (1994), Mind into Matter (2000), and Time Loops and Space Twists (2011).\n\nWolf was a member in the 1970s, with Jack Sarfatti and others, of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's Fundamental Fysiks Group founded in May 1975 by Elizabeth Rauscher and George Weissmann. His theories about the interrelation of consciousness and quantum physics were described by Newsweek in 2007 as \"on the fringes of mainstream science.\"\n\nBiography\nBorn into a Jewish family, Wolf's interest in physics began as a child when he viewed a newsreel depicting the world's first atomic explosion. Wolf received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from UCLA in 1963 and began researching the field of high atmospheric particle behavior following a nuclear explosion.\nHe has appeared as the resident physicist on the Discovery Channel's The Know Zone, was a participant in the PBS series Closer to Truth, and has appeared on radio talk shows and television shows across the United States and abroad.

He is known for his work on the physics of consciousness and has written several books on the subject, most notably Taking the Quantum Leap (1981) and The Eagle's Quest (1991). Wolf was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Temple University and then the University of Chicago, where he received his B.A. in physics in 1959 and his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1962. After leaving the university, Wolf worked as a research scientist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and at the Max Planck Institute for Applied Physics in Stuttgart, Germany. Wolf's major works focus on the relationship between modern quantum physics and consciousness. He is best known for his book Taking the Quantum Leap (1981), which introduced the idea of \"quantum consciousness\" - the notion that consciousness can influence physical reality. He has since written several other books exploring the implications of quantum physics for our understanding of the world. Wolf also gave public lectures and seminars on his work, including one given at the Esalen Institute in 1978. He has appeared in numerous documentaries and media programs, including the Skeptics Society's podcast and the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? He has been a guest speaker at the Fetzer Institute and the Temenos Academy. In addition to his work in the field of quantum physics, Wolf continues to write and lecture on topics ranging from spirituality and philosophy to pop culture. He lives in San Diego, California and remains active in the scientific and philosophical communities. He also writes regularly for New Realities and writes a bi-weekly column for Fearless Planet magazine. Wolf's latest book, Quantum Fitness: Harnessing the Power of Consciousness and Quantum Physics, was published in 2015. Wolf has remained active in public life and is a frequent guest speaker and panelist at universities, science and spiritual gatherings around the world. He has contributed to numerous radio and television programs, including the History Channel's The Universe, Beyond Human, and the Discovery Channel's When Darwin Met Einstein. He has also contributed to popular magazines such as The Atlantic, Psychology Today, Popular Science, and New Realities. Wolf's life and work have strongly influenced the fields of quantum physics and consciousness. His books, public appearances, and media presence have helped popularize the ideas of quantum physics and consciousness and make them accessible to a wider audience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1349757}

These terms were originally coined by Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985).\n\nTo see what is meant by 'reinforce' or 'offset', consider a situation in which the players all have similar choices to make, as in the paper of Bulow et al., where the players are all imperfectly competitive firms that must each decide how much to produce. Then the production decisions are strategic complements if an increase in the production of one firm increases the marginal revenues of the others, because that gives the others an incentive to produce more too. This tends to be the case if there are sufficiently strong aggregate increasing returns to scale and/or the demand curves for the firms' products have a sufficiently low own-price elasticity. On the other hand, the production decisions are strategic substitutes if an increase in one firm's output decreases the marginal revenues of the others, giving them an incentive to produce less.\n\nAccording to Russell Cooper and Andrew John, strategic complementarity is the basic property underlying examples of multiple equilibria in coordination games.\n\nCalculus formulation\nMathematically, consider a symmetric game with two players that each have payoff function , where  represents the player's own decision, and  represents the decision of the other player. Assume  is increasing and concave in the player's own strategy . Under these assumptions, the two decisions are strategic complements if an increase in each player's own decision  raises the marginal payoff  of the other player. In other words, the decisions are strategic complements if the second derivative  is positive for . Equivalently, this means that the function  is supermodular. \n\nOn the other hand, the decisions are strategic substitutes if  is negative, that is, if  is submodular.\n\nExample \n\nIn their original paper, Bulow et al. use a simple model of competition between two firms to illustrate their ideas.\nThe revenue for firm x with production rates  is given by\n \nwhile the revenue for firm y with production rate  in market 2 is given by \n \nAt any interior equilibrium, , we must have\n \nUsing vector calculus, geometric algebra, or differential geometry, Bulow et al. showed that the sensitivity \nof the Cournot equilibrium to changes in  can be calculated in terms of second partial derivatives\nof the payoff functions:\n\nWhen , \n\nThis, as price is increased in market 1, Firm x sells more in market 1 and less in market 2, while firm y sells more in market 2.

This type of relationship has been used to understand the behavior of economic actors, such as firms, stock market traders and consumers. In the context of game theory, strategic complements describe a game in which the dominant strategy of the other player influences the optimal course of action of the first player. In a strategic complement, a minimum payoff for one player increases if the other player chooses a higher payoff, and vice versa. Examples of strategic complements include the prisoner's dilemma, the battle of the sexes, Stackelberg duopoly and Bertrand duopoly. In the prisoner's dilemma, the two prisoners each choose whether to confess or to remain silent. If one prisoner remains silent, then the other prisoner is better off confessing, as he will then receive a lesser punishment. The same applies in the case of the battle of the sexes. Two individuals decide whether to go to the cinema or to a play. If one individual chooses to go to the play, the other individual obtains a higher payoff by going to the cinema. In Stackelberg duopoly, two firms same market and decide to price their goods. If one firm prices its good lower than the other, the second firm will be better off by pricing its good lower too, since the product is homogeneous. Similarly, in Bertrand duopoly, two firms sell a homogenous good and hence cannot influence the market demand by setting a different price than the other. In this case, the two firms are better off by choosing the same price. Strategic complements are used to model situations in which two parties have an interest in coordinating their behaviour. They also allow economists to better understand how firms and consumers respond to each other’s actions and to assess the potential of cooperation and coordination in the market. The concept of strategic complements has also been used to analyze the formation and dissolution of firms and the behaviour of trade unions. For example, the concept has been employed to explain why certain firms tend to merge or why some trade unions prefer to remain independent. In conclusion, strategic complements is a concept used in the field of game theory which describes the situation where one individual's actions positively influences the actions of the other party. This concept has been used to explain the behaviour of stock market traders, consumers, firms and trade unions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12645144}

The school primarily competes in the Horizon League, but competes in other conferences for fencing and lacrosse, sports not sponsored for either men or women by the Horizon League. Fencing, a co-ed sport, competes in the Midwest Fencing Conference. Men's lacrosse moved from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to the ASUN Conference in July 2021. Women's lacrosse joined the Mid-American Conference for that league's first women's lacrosse season in 2021.\n\nTeams\nA member of the Horizon League, Detroit Mercy sponsors 17 NCAA varsity teams (seven men's, eight women's, and one coed NCAA-sanctioned sports). Detroit Mercy is one of only 4 NCAA Division I schools that sponsors neither volleyball nor baseball (the other 3 being Boston University, Drexel, and Vermont). Previously the Tigers, in either 1919 or 1924 the school adopted the Titans nickname.\n\nNotes\n\nSports\n\nBasketball, men's\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Detroit Mercy named Mike Davis the 22nd head coach in men’s basketball program history. The NCAA Tournament-tested Davis previously coached at Texas Southern University, where he led the team to four regular season titles, four conference tournament championships and four NCAA Tournament appearances. He led Indiana University to the 2002 NCAA Championship game.\n\nStarring for the Titans is Davis’ son, Antoine Davis. In his debut season in 2018-19, Antoine Davis broke the NCAA Division I freshman record for 3-point field goals made in a season, previously held by NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nFormer head coach Ray McCallum led Detroit Mercy to the Horizon League Championship during the 2011-12 season, granting the Titans an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Detroit Mercy received a 15 seed and lost to the University of Kansas in the tournament's second round.\n\nMcCallum's predecessor Perry Watson led a successful program at Detroit's Southwestern High School and served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan before coming to Detroit Mercy and maintained strong recruiting ties within the city's public league. After 14 seasons Watson stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2007–2008 season. Watson guided Detroit Mercy to 10 winning seasons, three league titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and an NIT Final Four. The Titans two NCAA appearances also included victories over St. John's and UCLA. Between 1997–98 and 2000–01, the Titans had four straight 20-victory seasons.\n\nDick Vitale, ESPN's most well-known college basketball commentator, was the Detroit men's basketball head coach for four seasons (1973–1977) before becoming the school's athletic director in 1977. The following year he left to coach the Detroit Pistons. In his final year as a college head coach, \"Dickie V\" led the Titans to the Round of 16 in the 1977 NCAA Tournament before losing 86–81 to Michigan.\n\nBasketball, women's\n\nOn June 15, 2021, LaTanya Collins was named interim head coach for the 2021-22 season, replacing AnnMarie Gilbert. The program went through turmoil in what proved to be Gilbert's only season.\n\nDuring the 2020–21 season, extensively affected by COVID-19, Detroit Mercy was one of several Division I programs that canceled its season early, but the only one that did so for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. On January 17, 2021, the parents of all 14 players on the roster sent a letter to athletic director Robert Vowels Jr. alleging NCAA rules violations, as well as rampant emotional and physical abuse, by Gilbert. After an internal investigation, Detroit Mercy retained Gilbert, but after all 14 players on the 2020–21 roster left the program, Gilbert resigned on June 15, with assistant Collins taking over on an interim basis.\n\nGilbert’s predecessor, Bernard Scott, led the Titans to 33 wins in his first two seasons, including a trip to the Horizon League championship game at Joe Louis Arena in 2016-17. His contract was not renewed following the 2019-20 season.\n\nScott took over for Autumn Rademacher, a former star guard at Detroit Mercy. Rademacher coached the Titans from 2008-2015, guiding the team to 89 victories, including a 20-win season in 2011-12 and appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) and Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) National Tournament. In 2010–11, Rademacher led Detroit Mercy to a win over in-state rival and Big Ten member Michigan. The victory not only ended a six-game losing streak to Michigan, it was the first triumph over the Wolverines – as well as against the Big Ten – since 1994.\n\nLacrosse, men's\nThe Detroit Mercy men's lacrosse team, coached by Matt Holtz, won the 2013 MAAC Championship and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where they were downed in the fourth quarter by Notre Dame.\n\nFootball (discontinued)\n\nThe first attempt at a football team for the University of Detroit was known as the Detroit Heralds. That team was disbanded after the 1904 season, and most of the players formed an amateur team of the same name in 1905. Although the university team returned in 1906, the amateur team remained, eventually evolving into a semi-professional team, then a professional team, ultimately joining the National Football League as a charter member in 1920. The Heralds folded in 1921.\n\nIn 1928, the Detroit Titans under Gus Dorais finished with a record of 9-0-0. Several years later Parke H. Davis, considered to be a \"major selector\" by the NCAA, named the 1928 team to a share of the national championship\n\nJohn Idzik was the head coach for the final three seasons of the football program, from 1962 until 1964. His coaching record at Detroit was 6 wins, 21 losses and 1 tie.  The school then disbanded the football team after the 1964 season due to cost.\n\nOther\nSince 1996–97, Detroit Mercy athletic teams have won 26 league championships and made 13 NCAA postseason championships. The most recent team to do so was Detroit Mercy's softball team, which won the Horizon League Championship in 2019 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history.\n\nTournaments\nDetroit Mercy has been a host institution for several NCAA Tournament men’s basketball games.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oath of Pontida\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The oath of Pontida (Giurament de Pontida in Lombard, Giuramento di Pontida in Italian), according to tradition, would have been a ceremony that would have sanctioned on 7 April 1167, in the abbey of Pontida, near Bergamo, in Italy, the birth of the Lombard League, or of a military alliance between the municipalities of Milan, Lodi, Ferrara, Piacenza and Parma aimed at the armed struggle against the Holy Roman Empire by Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nThe oath of Pontida does not appear on contemporary documents, being mentioned for the first time in 1505, then three and a half centuries after the traditional date of 7 April 1167.\n\nHistory\n\nContemporary sources\n\nThe event is questioned by historians, given that in the contemporary chronicles written between 1152 and 1189, no Pontida oath is cited. Its first mention is in fact late, since it appears on a document dated 1505.\n\nHowever, contemporary sources cite the fact that the municipalities of the Lombard League had signed pacts to counter Barbarossa's hegemony by helping each other. Most of these writings, however, argue the event in a rather vague way, without describing the details: neither the locations nor the precise dates of the signing of the pacts are mentioned. On the Piacentina chronicle, regarding the agreement reached for the rebuilding of Milan, we can read:\n\nThe most precise contemporary historical sources tell of at least three oaths among the municipalities of the Lombard League: the first, signed between the end of February and the beginning of March 1167 between Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Mantua and known as the \"Bergamo oath \"; the second, also signed by Milan in March 1167, which joined the four cities in the just mentioned oath; the third, also signed by Lodi in May of the same year, which became part of the previously mentioned coalition, formed by Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Mantua and Milan.\n\nConsidering the date of 7 April 1167, we can therefore state that the oath of Pontida, even if it was actually signed, was not the constitution of the Lombard League, since at least two previous oaths are cited on historical documents.\n\nThe following documents\n\nIn addition to the chronological aspect, which would seem to demonstrate the non-existence of the oath of Pontida as a constitutive pact of the Lombard League due to the two agreements signed before 7 April 1167, the first mention of the incident must certainly also be considered which is quite posterior.\n\nIn particular, the oath of Pontida appears for the first time on a document dated 1505 by Bernardino Corio - therefore about 350 years after the canonical date of 7 April 1167 - which is called Historia Patria and which has as its subject the history of Milan.\n\nThen all the subsequent documents referring to the oath of Pontida were inspired by the Historia Patria by Bernardino Corio. In an excerpt from the code of 1584 Successores S. Barnabae Apostoli in Ecclesia Mediolanensi, which refers to a note on the archbishop of Milan Umberto Pirovano, it is reported that:\n\nIn Archiepiscoporum Mediolanensium series historico-chronologica, which was compiled by Giuseppe Antonio Sassi in 1755 and which is linked to the aforementioned text of 1584, it can instead be read:\n\nHypothesis on a possible oath of Pontida\nHowever, it is possible that there were other agreements signed by the municipalities of the Lombard League of which the documented trace was then lost. In fact, over the centuries, there are many examples in which several meetings were needed to write down all the aspects of a bargaining: in other words, in history, it has been difficult to define in detail a pact or an alliance in few sessions.\n\nAs far as Pontida is concerned, we must also observe its close link with Milan: the municipality near Bergamo belonged to the archdiocese of Milan although it was understood, from a geographical point of view, in the county of Bergamo.\n\nIt is therefore not excluded that there was also an oath at Pontida, whose references to contemporary documentation were then lost.\n\nCommemorations\nEvery year at Pontida, in the month of June, in the Giuramento square, the historical phases that led to the birth of the military pact signed, according to tradition, on 7 April 1167 are recalled by about one hundred people in costume. On the occasion of the re-enactment, recreational and cultural events are also organized.\n\nSince 1990, the autonomous political party of the Lega Nord has annually organized a meeting at Pontida that celebrates the eponymous medieval oath. During the event the most important political exponents of the party intervene.\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1167 in Europe\n12th century in Italy\n1160s in the Holy Roman Empire\nHistory of Lombardy\nOaths", "machine_text": " The Oath of Pontida is a particular Latin agreement from the Medieval era signed May 30th, 1167 in Pontida, a small town in Lombardy, Italy. It was made to express the common solidarity of the population of the Lombard League, formed in 1164 to defend the region’s autonomy from Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. The Oath declared that Lombards were loyal to the League and to their Lord, Lothair III of Supplinburg, striving to protect the integrity of their region against the German forces. The traitors and enemies of the Lombard League had to swear the Oath of Pontida, which was designed to identify and isolate anyone who went against the League or its declared beliefs. The Oath called for oath breakers to be excluded from the League, as well as from any promises or compacts made by it. This policy was necessary to ensure that the members of the League remained true to their values and commitments. One of the most significant aspects of the Oath of Pontida was that the text was written in Latin and was signed by more than 700 Lombard warriors. This was tremendous in terms of its impact as it would have been one of the first times an agreement was made between such a large number of warriors, who all bore witness to the same document and agreed to abide by its laws. What is also significant about the Oath of Pontida is that it is often cited as a precedent for modern constitutional documents and declarations of independence. The language of the Oath was particularly impactful as it was used to emphasize the right to freedom, democracy and self-determination. Thus, it is seen as a foundational document of modern democracy. Throughout its influence, the Oath of Pontida has served as a reminder that the peace and liberty of a people rests upon the principles of justice, respect and compromise. The legacy of the Oath lives on to this day as it inspired Lombardy to continue its fight for freedom and autonomy. The Oath serves as a reminder of the importance of loyalty, courage and determination in the fight for justice.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39665560}

This included the demise of the band’s former label Moon Records, a 3-year incarceration of lead singer and toaster Freddie \"3D\" Weaver, and the death of bari-sax player Trish Johnson, who was killed in the morning while traveling to Shenandoah, PA, to visit her mother. Despite these obstacles, after taking a nearly 3-year hiatus, the band began rehearsals again in 2003 and completed the CD.\n\nThe band’s latest release, and first truly fresh studio endeavor of the decade, is the 5-song EP entitled God’s Ghetto (2008). The EP is released on the East-African record label Lulu Nyeusi and represents the first known American ska-influenced music release on an African record label. Ruder Than You has always had an eclectic sound and this release is no exception. For this installment, the band chose tunes heavy on old school hip-hop and dancehall and emphasized lyrics penned by Weaver. While these songs differ a bit from the familiar feel of previous albums, they offer the same extraordinary energy and catchiness.\n\nThe band’s current roster of veteran members includes the Round Mound of Dub Sound - singer Freddie Weaver. Band leader Doug Dubrosky still sings and plays tenor sax. He and Don Pancoe on bass hail from the earliest days of RTY. Rod Martino and Chris Klimchak fill out the lineup on guitar and trombone, respectively. Larry \"Ace\" Snell of The Toasters and Public Service sits on the drum throne.\n\n Discography \nBig Step - Moon Records - 1992\nHorny For Ska - Moon Records - 1996\nPhilly Stylee - God’s Ghetto Records - 2005\nGod's Ghetto EP - Lulu Nyeusi Records, Tanzania - 2008\nCreation Sounds - God's Ghetto Records - 2009\n\n Compilations \nThe Shack - 1993 Dojo Limited/BIB Records, contains the song \"Get Some Peace\" .\nUnited Colors of SKA - 1993 Pork Pie Records, contains the song \"I Want Justice\".\nSka The Third Wave - 1995 Continuum Records, contains the song \"Swallow Blood\".\nSka The Third Wave Volume II - 1996 Shanachie Records, contains live versions of the songs \"Misskaculation\" and \"Paranoid\".\nRude Vibes: The Ultimate Collection of New Skool Ska - 1996 Do The Dog Music, contains the song \"Uncle Albert\".\nSKAndalous: I’ve Gotcha Covered - 1996 Shanachie Records, contains Ruder Than You’s version of Black Sabbath’s \"Paranoid\".\nOi-Skampilation Volume II - 1996 Radical Records, contains the song \"I Want Justice\".\nSKA: Cover it Up - 1997 Beloved Records, contains live versions of \"Misskaculation\" and \"Paranoid\".\nDeamons - 1997 Skully Enterprises, contains a live version of \"Future Girl\".\nSKAndalous: I’ve Gotcha Covered - Volume II - 1997 Shanachie Records, features Ruder Than You’s version of The Beatles’ \"Tax Man\".\nSKA: The Instrumentals - 1997 Beloved Records, contains the song \"Swatara\".\nFreedom Sounds: A Tribute to the Skatalites - 1997 Shanachie Records, contains Ruder Than You’s Version of \"El Pussycat\".\nDancin’ Mood - 1997 Triple Crown Records, contains a live version of \"Uncle Albert\"''.\n\nExternal links \nOfficial Website\nPurevolume Page\nMyspace Page\nRuder Than You collection at the Internet Archive's live music archive\n\nAmerican reggae musical groups\nAmerican ska musical groups\nThird-wave ska groups", "machine_text": " Ruder Than You is an American punk rock band formed in Buffalo, New York in 2002. The band is composed of vocalist and guitarist John Shields, bassist Sean Maloney, and drummer Matt Thomas. After building a small local following, the band released its self-titled debut album in 2003, which was produced by Chicago-based producer Sanford Parker. The band's sound has been said to mix elements of skate punk, post-hardcore, and even hardcore. The primary songwriter, John Shields, often incorporates politically-charged lyrics into their songs, taking a stance against the unjustified use of military force, the current state of American politics, and the biases deep rooted in social injustice. In 2005, the band added a third guitarist, Danny Johnson, and released their sophomore album, Voices, which received much critical acclaim, charting at #5 on the Billboard 200. Ruder Than You’s third album, titled Blitzkrieg was released in 2008 reaching #4 on the Billboard Chart. Produced by iconic punk rock producer Brett Gurewitz, this album signaled a change in the sound of the band, utilizing louder production and the addition of more complex song structures. With the years leading up to 2014, the band remained mostly inactive with few small tours in the years surrounding their 4th studio album, Aging Gracefully, which “carried on the tradition of fiery punk rock while recognizing the improvement of the band’s musicianship” (Scenestar). In 2017, the band began to heavily tour in support of a 5th studio album, and again tapped Brett Gurewitz to produce. After a series of successful tour dates, 2018 saw the release of the punk opus Modern Warfare. The 11 track album saw significant success beyond anything the band had seen prior, and gained them a performance slot on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the same year. Ruder Than You is currently continuing to tour and support their discography, while starting to produce new music for a 6th studio album set to be released in 2021. The band’s success continues to be attributed to the sheer intensity of their live performances, as well as the lyrical wit and quality of their albums.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4676262}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"J.M.K.E.\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "J.M.K.E. is an Estonian punk rock band, which formed in Tallinn on January 18, 1986.\n\nBiography \nThe original singer, Mati, left the band soon afterwards, leaving Venno on drums, Tarvo Hanno Varres on bass, and Villu Tamme on vocals and guitar, sometimes working together with guest singers (with Tõnu Trubetsky from Vennaskond playing under the name \"Vürst Trubetsky & J.M.K.E.\"). For the first three years they mainly played concerts in Estonia, with a few also in Latvia, Lithuania and Russia. Later the band has toured Europe several times.\n\nThey became one of the more popular rock outfits in Estonia. In 1987 Villu wrote \"Tere Perestroika\", initially singing it alone with guitar. Later the band made numerous different versions of the song. It became a big hit because of its humorous topicality (Perestroika) and in 1988 won a song contest on a popular Estonian TV show. In 1988 came the first line-up change – Tarvo Hanno Varres left the band, later to join Estonian indie rock group Röövel Ööbik and a new bass player, Lembit, joined the band.\n\nIn 1989 the newly created Finnish record label Stupido Twins, with the aim of publishing some Estonian bands. J.M.K.E.'s \"Tere Perestroika\" was the first release. The winds of change in the Soviet Union had already blown some chains away, and so J.M.K.E. were able to travel abroad for the first time in April 1989, playing their first concert in Finland to middle-aged communists at the Leftist Forum in Helsinki. Later that autumn they recorded for Stupido Twins their first LP, Külmale Maale (To the Cold Country), which was the first Estonian rock record made abroad. Maximum Rock'n'Roll called it \"absolutely excellent\". At the end of 1989, Venno left the band declaring that J.M.K.E. had “Become too commercial for me”, and Ardo took his place.\n\nThe band toured Estonia, the Nordic countries, and Germany, made a couple of EPs, and only by 1993 started to record a new album, Gringode Kultuur (Culture of Gringos). Meanwhile Estonia had regained its independence and J.M.K.E. couldn't continue with their anti-Soviet songs, so they found their new \"enemy\" in the invading \"burger-culture\", increasing poverty, and other early-capitalistic distresses. Lembit left the band in 1994 and was replaced by Sten. J.M.K.E. got also a new drummer, Andres.\n\nTheir third album, Sputniks in Pectopah (\"Sputniks at Restaurant\"), was released in 1995. The album is an eclectic collection of popular Russian songs, sung in high energy Russian. The cover versions include the national anthem of czarist Russia, old revolutionary marches, soldiers' songs from World War II, and melodies from popular cartoons.\n\nIn January 1996 J.M.K.E. celebrated their 10th birthday with the longest lasting concert of their history presenting on stage almost all persons who had ever played with the band, permanently or temporarily, and with a cassette-only-release, Rumal Nali (Silly Joke, on Fucking Cunt Records). This contained old D.I.Y. recordings mainly from 1986 and 1987. J.M.K.E. didn't make their first \"tidy\" studio recording until 1989 in Finland although by that stage they had enough songs for three or four albums. It was just impossible to release punk rock records under the vigilant glance of sickle and hammer.\n\nJ.M.K.E. have gradually abandoned their directly political slogans and now tell more varied stories than before. Their fifth album,  (Invasion of Rabbits, 1996), is a good example of their present character. Some consider it to be J.M.K.E.'s best product since \"Külmale Maale\".\n\nIn 2000, after 4 years of silence, the album  was released. By then female back-up singers Livia Kurik (\"Tirts\") and Kerti Alev (\"Promille Promille\") joined the band; they left in 2012.\n\nIn 2006 J.M.K.E. released another album. This one for their 20th birthday, called Mälestusi Eesti NSV-st (A Memoir of the Estonian SSR). This includes songs that were recorded in a professional studio for the first time, for example \"\", \"\", \"\" and many more.\n\nIn 2011, the album Jasonit ei huvita was released, which features a selection of cover songs. In 2012, drummer Roland Sutt joined the band.

(in full Jaan Kaarelsoni Muusikukooli Eesti Osakond, meaning \"Jaan Kaarelson Music School Estonian Department\") is an Estonian punk rock band formed in 1984 and active until 1988. The band's name is an acronym derived from the full name of its founding school, the Jaan Kaarelson Music School, located in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. The group's four original members included frontman Peeter-Lauri Olbert, guitarist Villem Post, bassist Alar Kriisa and drummer Jaan Laks. This lineup played together until 1986, when Laks and Post were replaced, respectively, by Märt Pius and Viktor Etverk. By 1988, the group had disbanded and its members gone off to pursue separate projects. J.M.K.E. was renowned in the Estonian punk scene both for its exuberant live performances and its distinctively minimalist sound. The band's music was characterized by fast-paced, driving punk riffs, simple melodies, and a straightforward lyrical style that was often politically oriented. The group had a string of minor hits in Estonia during its heyday, including \"Kõik On Valmis,\" \"Ei Hooli,\" and a track from its second album, \"Kas Me Võime Lõputult Rankerda.\" However, the band never achieved genuine fame beyond Estonia and has been labeled a \"cult secret\" by some sources. J.M.K.E. served as a major influence on later Estonian punk bands and is often cited as the group that sparked the Estonian punk movement of the mid-1980s. The group's short three-year career has earned comparison to international punk rock acts such as The Ramones and The Clash, though the band's greatest legacy remains in Estonia, where its music and message served as a beacon of hope during a time of political oppression. The group achieved a form of posthumous recognition when its landmark 1985 album, Vanglas (\"Daily Doze\"), became the first Estonian punk album to be re-released onto compact disc in 2001. This sparked renewed interest in the band, and two compilations of their music were released between 2003 and 2006. J.M.K.E. are today widely considered one of Estonia's most significant musical acts from the 1980s.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5256540}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bourbon Street\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bourbon Street (, ) is a historic street in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. Extending thirteen blocks from Canal Street to Esplanade Avenue, Bourbon Street is famous for its many bars and strip clubs.\n\nWith 17.74 million visitors in 2017 alone, New Orleans depends on Bourbon Street as a main tourist attraction. Tourist numbers have been growing yearly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city has successfully rebuilt its tourist base. For millions of visitors each year, Bourbon Street provides a rich insight into New Orleans' past.\n\nHistory of Bourbon Street and environs\n\n1700 to 1880\n\nThe French claimed Louisiana in the 1690s, and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was appointed Director General in charge of developing a colony in the territory. He founded New Orleans in 1718. In 1721, the royal engineer Adrien de Pauger designed the city's street layout. He named the streets after French royal houses and Catholic saints. He paid homage to France's ruling family, the House of Bourbon, with the naming of Bourbon Street.\n\nNew Orleans was given to the Spanish in 1763 following the Seven Years' War. The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 destroyed 80 percent of the city's buildings. The Spanish rebuilt many of the damaged structures, which are still standing today. For this reason, Bourbon Street and the French Quarter display more Spanish than French influence.\n\nFollowing a brief restoration of French rule, the Americans gained control of the colony with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. They translated the French street names into English, with Rue Bourbon becoming Bourbon Street.\n\nDuring the 19th century, New Orleans was similar to other Southern cities in that its economy was based on selling cash crops, such as sugar and tobacco. By 1840, newcomers whose wealth came from these enterprises turned New Orleans into the third largest metropolis in the country. The city's port was the nation's second largest, with New York City being the largest.\n\nThe main difference between New Orleans and other Southern cities was its unique cultural heritage as a result of formerly having been a French and Spanish possession. Promoters emphasized this cultural legacy, in the form of its architecture, cuisine and traditions, to attract tourists to New Orleans.\n\n1880 to 1960\nThe French Quarter was central to this image of cultural legacy and became the best-known part of the city. Recent arrivals in New Orleans criticized the perceived loose morals of the Creoles, a perception that drew many travelers to New Orleans to drink, gamble and visit the city's brothels, beginning in the 1880s.\n\nBourbon Street was a premier residential area prior to 1900. This changed in the late 1800s and early 1900s,, when the Storyville red-light district was constructed on Basin Street adjacent to the French Quarter. The area became known for prostitution, gambling and vaudeville acts. Jazz is said to have developed here, with artists such as King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton providing musical entertainment at the brothels.\n\nThis was also the era when some of New Orleans' most famous restaurants were founded, including Galatoire's, located at 209 Bourbon Street. It was established by Jean Galatoire in 1905. Known for years by its characteristic line snaking down Bourbon Street, patrons waited for hours just to get a table — especially on Fridays.\n\nBefore World War II, the French Quarter was emerging as a major asset to the city's economy. While there was an interest in historic districts at the time, developers pressured to modernize the city. Simultaneously, with the wartime influx of people, property owners opened adult-centered nightclubs to capitalize on the city's risqué image. Wartime Bourbon Street was memorably depicted in Erle Stanley Gardner’s detective novel “Owls Don’t Blink”. After the war, Bourbon Street became the new Storyville in terms of reputation. By the 1940s and 1950s, nightclubs lined Bourbon Street. Over 50 different burlesque shows, striptease acts and exotic dancers could be found.\n\n1960 to today\n\nThere was a move in the 1960s under District Attorney Jim Garrison to clean up Bourbon Street. In August 1962, two months after he was elected, Garrison began raiding adult entertainment establishments on Bourbon. His efforts mirrored those of his predecessors, which had been largely unsuccessful; however, he had more success. He forced closure on a dozen nightclubs convicted of prostitution and selling overpriced alcohol. Following this campaign, Bourbon Street was populated by peep shows and sidewalk beer stands.\n\nWhen Mayor Moon Landrieu came into office in 1970, he focused his efforts on stimulating tourism. He did so by making Bourbon Street a pedestrian mall, making it more inviting. The 1980s and 1990s were characterized by a Disneyfication of Bourbon Street. Critics of the rapid increase of souvenir shops and corporate ventures said that Bourbon Street had become Creole Disneyland. They also argued that the street's authenticity had been lost in this process.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, a giant saxophone, nearly  high, was inaugurated in the street. It was offered by the city of Namur (Belgium) to recall that the inventor of the instrument Adolphe Sax is from the region of Namur, specifically Dinant.\n\nImpact of Hurricane Katrina\n\nGiven Bourbon Street's high-ground location in the French Quarter, it was mostly intact following 2005's Hurricane Katrina. A major tourist attraction, Bourbon Street renovation was given high priority after the storm. However, New Orleans was still experiencing a lack of visitors. In 2004, the year before Katrina, the city had 10.1 million visitors. The year after the storm, that number was 3.7 million.\n\nOne third of the city's operating budget, approximately $6 billion before Katrina, came from visitors and conventions, so officials saw tourism as vital for post-disaster economic recovery.\n\nThe New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corporation initiated efforts to draw visitors back to the city, featuring celebrities such as Emeril Lagasse and Patricia Clarkson with the slogan, \"Come fall In love with Louisiana all over again.\" Travelers heard mixed messages in the media. Advertising campaigns gave the impression that New Orleans was thriving, while city leaders asked for increased federal financial assistance and National Guard troops to help control municipal crime waves.\n\nNew Orleans has been working its way back to pre-Katrina tourist numbers, as it attracted 9.5 million visitors in 2014 and 10.5 million visitors in 2016. The 2016 record was the highest since 2004.\n\nFor a time in April 2017, the 100 block of Bourbon Street was closed off for reconstruction of the street and its underground utilities as part of the city's $6 million French Quarter infrastructure project.\n\nEntertainment, bars, and restaurants\n\nLargely quiet during the day, Bourbon Street comes alive at night – particularly during the French Quarter's many festivals.  Most famous of these is the annual Mardi Gras celebration, when the streets teem with thousands of people.  Local open container laws allow drinking alcoholic beverages on the Quarter's streets. Popular drinks include the hurricane cocktail, the resurrection cocktail, the hand grenade and the so-called \"huge-ass beers\" – a large plastic cup of draft beer marketed to tourists at a low price.\n\nThe most heavily visited section of Bourbon Street is \"upper Bourbon Street\" toward Canal Street, an eight-block section of visitor attractions including bars, restaurants, souvenir shops and strip clubs. In the 21st century, Bourbon Street is the home of New Orleans Musical Legends Park, a free, outdoor venue for live jazz performances. The park has sculptures and other tributes to the city's legendary music personalities.\n\nMost of the bars are located in the central section of Bourbon. Popular spots include Pat O'Brien's, Johnny White's, the Famous Door, Spirits on Bourbon, Channing Tatum's Saints and Sinners, Razzoo and The Cat's Meow. Marie Laveau's House of Voodoo is located on the corner of St. Ann Street.\n\nThe most renowned restaurant on Bourbon Street is Galatoire's; it represents traditional New Orleans dining and has a dress code. Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop and the Old Absinthe House are two of the many casual eateries. Also notable is the locals’ hangout, the Bourbon House.\n\n\"Lower Bourbon Street\" (lower being a reference to downriver, or downstream Mississippi River), from the intersection of St. Ann Street, caters to New Orleans' thriving gay community. Featuring such establishments as Oz and the city's largest gay nightclub, the Bourbon Pub, St. Ann Street has been referred to as \"the Velvet Line\" or \"the Lavender Line,\" the edge or approximate boundary of the French Quarter's gay community. Cafe-Lafitte-in-Exile is the oldest gay bar in the nation. The intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann Streets is also the center of the Labor Day weekend event Southern Decadence, commonly referred to as the Gay Mardi Gras, which attracts upwards of 100,000 participants.\n\nLegal issues\n\nHistorically, noise violations were the responsibility of the individual making the noise. This changed in 1996 with Yokum v. 615 Bourbon Street, which ruled that the property owner, not the noise-maker, is responsible for noise violations. A 2010 city ordinance states that no music may be played in the French Quarter between 8 pm and 9 am. Enforcement has been inconsistent, and critics claim its goals are vague. Some even say that the local law is unconstitutional. Besides being difficult to enforce, music enthusiasts claim that noise ordinances threaten the city's notable music culture. Local jazz bands who play in the streets, such as the To Be Continued Brass Band, would be prohibited from doing so under such ordinances.\n\n\"Aggressive solicitation\" bans are a more recent issue on Bourbon Street. In 2011, an ordinance was passed which prohibited individuals and groups from \"disseminating any social, political or religious message\" at night. The ordinance did not explain the justification for the rule.  On September 21, 2012, the ACLU of Louisiana won a temporary restraining order against the ban, on behalf of Kelsey McCauley (Bohn), a woman who converted to Christianity through a religious group's activities on Bourbon Street. The group had several of its members arrested, some of whom were cited on September 14, 2012, for violating the anti-solicitation ordinance.  A hearing was set for October 1, 2012.\n\nOn July 25, 2013, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-0 to amend the law and exempt Bourbon Street from the ban, with legal language found acceptable by the participating attorneys.\n\nSee also\n French Quarter\n French Market\n Jackson Square\n Royal Street\n Basin Street\n Canal Street\n Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Bourbon Street on neworleans.com\n Bourbon Street on frenchquarter.com\n\nStreets in New Orleans\nFrench Quarter\nEconomy of New Orleans\nEntertainment districts in the United States\nTourist attractions in New Orleans", "machine_text": " Bourbon Street is a famous, historic street in the heart of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.

Bourbon Street is an iconic part of the Big Easy because of its colorful history and unique street style. The street was once a residential area, built by French contractors in the 1700s for French soldiers – but with the common arrival of African slaves, the area became a bustling entertainment district. Jazz music, including the unique sound of jazz, was especially popular, and Bourbon Street also developed a reputation for debauchery and charged with energy. Today, Bourbon Street is still an extremely popular destination for tourists to the Big Easy. The street is often divided into three sections: the upper portion, which is the most touristy and busiest; the middle portion, where clubs and bars line the streets, playing live jazz and hosting drink specials and street festivals; and the lower portion, where the more old-school vibes live and the locals and a more authentic experience can be found. Bourbon Street offers a variety of sights, sounds, and experiences. It proudly features live music acts and performances each night, taking inspiration from its storied history of jazz and blues. In addition, its restaurants and bars offer an array of Creole cuisine, as well as traditional New Orleans dishes like jambalaya and po’boys. There are also plenty of places to shop for t-shirts, mementos, and other souvenirs. Bourbon Street is definitely a must-see for visitors to the area, offering a unique cultural experience found nowhere else in the United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Henning Alexander von Kleist\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Henning Alexander von Kleist (1676/77–1749) was an 18th-century Prussian field marshal. He fought in the War of Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War, and in the Wars of Austrian Succession.  In particular, his actions at the Battle of Mollwitz brought him acclaim, although he had long been a stalwart supporter of Prussian military developments by the Prussian kings Frederick (1740–1786) and Frederick William I (1713–1740).\n\nFamily\nKleist belonged to an old Pomeranian family that stemmed from the year 1175, and the family served the Duke Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania in his wars. In the 14th century, the family divided into three lines, from three brothers.  The oldest line was the Dubberow-Tuchow line; the Muttrin-Damen line was second, and the third was Bilnow-Raddatz, which ended in 1784.  In total, the Kleist line produced more than 19 generals, and an assortment of poets, inventors, scientists, and philosophers.\n\nHenning Alexander von Kleist was born on 4 May in 1676 or 1677 in Raddatz in Pomerania. He was the third son of Joachim Daniel von Kleist. and his first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel.\n\nHis father married three times.  The first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel, 18 May 1644, 1672 married, and died 3 January 1685.  She was the second daughter of Heinrich von Ramel and Else Sophia von Münchow, from Bulgrin.  She bore four sons, and one daughter:\nJürgen (died before 1688)\nPhilipp Heinrich. Initially served in Prussian military, but after a duel, left Prussia and settled in Brussels.  There he married Antonia Catharine van der Linden on 26 February 1704.  He entered French service as a lieutenant in the Regiment de la Mare, fought in the War of Spanish Succession and died on 10 September 1709, in the Battle of Malplaquet.  He had one son, Ludwig, who died on 18 May 1780, without legitimate descendants.\nHenning Alexander (1676–1747)\nMaria Catherine 10 February 1677, 23 May 1701 married Jürgen Heinrich von Kleist (of Raddtz), 27 February 1753 (in Juchow).\nRichard Christian, called himself Richard; served in the military, Infantry Regiment Borck (No 33z)., By 7 May 1714, he was Major, 24 July–4 August 1718, stationed in Colberg as commander.  22 October 1718, Lt Colonel with the Infantry Regiment Mosel. Died in Wesel 1723.\nLeopold, died without male issue.\nBalthazar Gustav 16 April 1689–8 April 1694.\n\nMilitary service\n\nKleist served in the Prussian military during the reigns of three kings: Frederick I, Frederick William I, and Frederick the Great. He joined the Prussian military in the Alt-Anhalt Regiment in 1698 or 1699, and saw active service continuously from the War of Spanish Succession, which began in 1701, until the Peace of Utrecht in 1713: he served in campaigns in the Netherlands, France and the Italian states under the command of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, known as the Old Dessauer (der alte Dessauer). Consequently, he learned the military craft under the leadership of one of the foremost infantry commanders of the age. He fought at the memorable Battle of Blenheim in 1704 in the wing commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy. During the 1704 campaign, he also saw action under the leadership of the legendary Türken-Louis.  After the victories in southern Germany, his regiment went to northern Italy, where it participated in the fighting of Cassano in 1705.  He also helped to break the siege at Turin in 1706, as part of the relief column that attacked the French army. Subsequently, he served in the Great Northern War (1705–1721), and participated in the lengthy Siege of Stralsund (1711–15). He acquired the patent as Chief (Inhaber) of his regiment in 1718, which he held until retirement in 1723.\n\nIn 1726 he was recalled to service by Frederick William I. In 1730 he acquired the patent as proprietor of the Old Prussian Infantry Regiment, which, in 1806 became regiment No. 26.  He held that patent until his death in 1749. During the decade of the 1730s, he was in regular communication with the then-Prince Frederick, and became one of his trusted commanders.\n\nDuring the War of Austrian Succession, in 1741 as a lieutenant general he commanded the city Kolberg. As a participant in the Battle of Mollwitz, his infantry regiment not only held its line despite the flight of the Prussian cavalry, but subsequently attacked the Austrian line with such ferocity that he and his soldiers received special mention in Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin's report. He was wounded in the fighting. The regiment's actions here reflected the iron training imposed by the prince of Anhalt Dessau on his subordinates, and their subsequent training of their own regiments.  In addition, the Prussian infantry benefited not only from the discipline of drill but also the latest in military technology; unlike their Austrian counterparts, they had iron ramrods which allowed them to fire faster and more accurately. After the battle, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle on 15 April 1741, and later awarded the Order Pour le Mérite. During the Silesian Wars, in 1744 he acquired as war booty the gold-plated carriage originally belonging to Jan Sobieski; Kleist gave the carriage to his local church.\n\nIn 1745 Kleist was promoted to General of Infantry and two years later, in 1747, to field marshal, at the conclusion of a grand troop revue. He was promoted at the same time as Count Friedrich Ludwig, Graf zu Dohna-Carwinden, von Kalckstein (Frederick's educator and lifelong Councillor), Joachim Christof von Jeetze and Dietrich of Anhalt-Dessau. He became ill in 1749; von Kleist died on 22 August, at age of 73.\n\nDescendants\nKleist married Albertine Marie von Biedersee, daughter of Georg Burchardt of Biedersee from Ilberstädt, who died on 23 June 1731 in Rindbett.

Kleist was born in Pomerania, the son of a cavalry officer who served in the Brandenburg-Prussian Army and his wife, who was of the noble von Caprivi family descended from the Line of Gostyn. He was descended from a long line of warriors and was related to several of Prussia's leading generals and statesmen. Kleist joined the army of Prussia in 1779, rising in rank within a few years and seeinng action in the Netherlands and on the Rhine. In 1795, he was promoted to major and appointed adjutant to the commander of the Prussian Corps in the French Revolutionary Wars, General Yorck von Wartenburg. In 1793, he fought in the Battle of Kaiserslautern and took part in a daring raid on the French camp of Charleroi. Eventually, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and then colonel. He participated in the successful Prussian campaign of 1806, and went on to fight in the battles of Eylau and Friedland. In 1808, he was made a general-major and became a Divisional commander of a brigade at Heilsberg and Guttstadt. In 1809, he took part in the battles at Lutzen and Bautzen. It was shortly before the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 that Kleist was awarded the Pour le Mérite, Prussia's highest honor, for his actions at Lützen. Kleist continued to display his bravery during the War of Liberation of 1813–14, distinguishing himself at Waterloo and commanding the entrenchments at Laon. Kleist was appointed chief of staff to Prince August of Prussia in 1830. He was made a Baron of the Royal House of Prussia four years later. Kleist died on 13 November 1831 and was buried at Templin. Kleist's memorial monument in the Town Hall of Neustrelitz depicts him holding a flag in his right hand, with the words: “Here lies the loyal Henning von Kleist, Field Marshal of Infantry, Baron of Prussia and beloved Knight of the Iron Cross, he who served Prussia valiantly and bravely against all invaders, 1831.” The Prussian Army honored General von Kleist by naming several barracks and regiments after him. The 8th Leib Infantry Regiment, founded in 1808, bears General von Kleist's name.

A bookish and kindly middle-aged bachelor, he helps Oliver to escape the clutches of Fagin. He later adopts Oliver Twist by the end of the novel.\n\nThe novel\nMr Brownlow is introduced when the Artful Dodger and his companion Charley Bates pick his pocket and Oliver Twist is arrested simply for \"looking guilty\". Later, in court, Brownlow discovers Oliver is completely innocent and, after dealing with the extremely agitated magistrate, Mr Fang, he takes him home fearing the boy to be very ill, which he is. He calls on a doctor, who after making frequent incorrect guesses to Oliver's condition, simply concludes the boy is recovering from a fever.\n\nBrownlow's maid, Mrs Bedwin, is a kind old lady who immediately takes to Oliver upon his arrival. Later, when Grimwig, an old friend of Brownlow's, evaluates the boy and his condition, a boy arrives from the book shop but fails to take some other books that needed to be returned. Oliver volunteers to return them and takes off, much to the chagrin and doubt of Mr Grimwig, who is revealed to be cynical in nature, expecting the boy to return to his old life among the lower class and promises to \"eat his head\" should the boy return in 10 minutes. A watch is set down and the waiting begins. Later, after Oliver is captured by Nancy and Bill Sikes, it is revealed that much later, close to midnight, the two men are still waiting in the dark. (In the 1997 film version of the novel, Mr Brownlow asks Oliver to take a couple of books and some money and asks him to be back in half an hour, although Oliver says he will be back in 20 minutes.)\n\nThe next mention of Brownlow occurs when Mr Bumble rears him after he sees a notice in a newspaper that offers five guineas for any knowledge about Oliver's past or whereabouts; it was a sticky encounter. Mr Bumble at once tells Brownlow that Oliver was born from deplorable lineage and, ever since birth, Oliver has done nothing but display ingratitude and malice. He also mentions Oliver had attacked another boy without provocation and shows Brownlow reports to prove it. Brownlow doesn't want to believe it at first, but gradually comes to conclusion that Oliver had been playing him for a fool and requests Oliver's name should not be invoked in his household ever again. His housekeeper Mrs Bedwin, however, feels that Oliver was truly a good child and not a criminal.\n\nWhen Oliver is taken in by the Maylies and asks the kind Dr. Losberne to take him to Brownlow's home in London only to find the house is \"FOR LEASE\". The only clue to his whereabouts are from his neighbours mentioning the West Indies, saying he was looking for someone.\n\nWhen Mr Brownlow returns to London, Oliver by chance spots him and can clear his name. Mr Brownlow is very happy about that and takes Oliver in once again, taking part in Nancy's plot to save Oliver from Fagin.  At the end of the book, Brownlow officially adopts Oliver as his son.\n\nSources\n\nMr Brownlow's name and character generally believed to be derived from John Brownlow, the director of the Foundling Hospital, which was dedicated to looking after abandoned and unwanted children.  Dickens, a regular visitor to the hospital, knew Brownlow well. Dickens scholar Robert Alan Colby argues that \"in naming Oliver's benefactor Mr Brownlow, Dickens seems to have been paying a tribute to one of the most dedicated social servants of his age\". In 1831, seven years before Dickens wrote Oliver Twist, John Brownlow had written a novel about an orphan called Hans Sloane - a Tale, which has a plot broadly similar to Dickens' later work. Several critics have suggested that Dickens took aspects of the basic plot of his novel from Brownlow's earlier work, so the name may have been a tribute for two reasons.\n\nVariations\nBrownlow is presented as Oliver's grandfather in David Lean's 1948 film version of the novel (actor: Henry Stephenson). This is also the case in the stage musical version. In the musical, after retrieving him from London Bridge, where Nancy is murdered while trying to return the boy to Brownlow, it is assumed that Oliver goes to live with him. However, this may vary between productions as in the latest revival, as in the 1968 film Oliver is taken hostage and subsequently saved when Bill is shot during his escape attempt (actor: Joseph O'Conor).\n\nIn the film version of Oliver!, Brownlow is made into Oliver's great-uncle, and the boy is saved, not at London Bridge, but from the rooftops of London, where Bill Sikes, who has murdered Nancy and taken Oliver as a hostage, has forced him to crawl out on a wooden hoist in order to loop a rope that Sikes intends to use in his escape. However, Sikes is shot by a member of the crowd below, and Oliver is saved.\n\nIn Disney's Oliver & Company, Brownlow's variant is represented as a little girl named Jenny Foxworth (actress: Natalie Gregory), who is cared for by her butler Winston while her parents are on a business trip to Europe. She adopts the kitten Oliver after a failed heist and is the one who names him. Unlike the novel, after Oliver disappears, Jenny begins searching for him with the help of her dog Georgette (the film's version of Charlotte) and runs into Fagin who is moved by her plight and gives Oliver back. She is soon after kidnapped by Sikes and a chase ensues with Fagin, the dogs and Oliver rescuing her.\n\nPortrayals\nActors who have portrayed Mr Brownlow in films and TV:\nLionel Belmore (1922 film)\nAlec B.

He is portrayed as a kind and generous elderly gentleman who adopts Oliver Twist as his son. Mr Brownlow is described as an elderly gentleman with a full white wig, a beaming smile, and a pleasant manner. He is the first to recognize that Oliver is of decent character despite having been raised in the slums of London. He is well-respected in the neighborhood and known for his kindhearted nature and generous spirit. Mr Brownlow is introduced in the novel as a bookseller living on London's London Street. He is a quiet man, who mostly keeps to himself. He notices Oliver and takes an interest in him. He questions Oliver about his past and decides to help him out of his ordeal. He takes Oliver in and adopts him, fulfilling a fatherly figure that the orphaned Oliver had been longing for. Mr Brownlow tires to make Oliver a respectable citizen by disciplining him and teaching him virtuous habits. He takes Oliver to school and sets an example for him with his own generous spirit. Mr Brownlow is willing to overlook Oliver’s past by providing him financial and emotional support. Mr. Brownlow's character is also described as a charitable, trustworthy and patient man who follows moral principles and defends the justice, being a \"good Samaritan\" in the novel. He is willing to help complete strangers, when he learns the identity of Oliver he pays Norton the debt he had incurred to save the boy. Despite his kindness, Mr. Brownlow can also be stern and demanding of Oliver. He never tolerates Oliver’s lies and condemns his theft and other misdeeds. He has a natural tendency to immediately suspicion the worst of people, such as Nancy. However, his loyalty and devotion to Oliver is tested when he discovers Oliver may be related to the Sowerberrys, who were the former employers of Oliver. Brownlow is uncertain about how to deal with the situation, but eventually allows Oliver to stay and slowly realizes that he will be a better father to Oliver than his possible relatives. Mr Brownlow is a compassionate and understanding character and provides Oliver with love and security, setting an example for him to learn the virtues of hard work and compassion. His kindness and benevolence symbolize what is best in human nature and serve as an example of virtue to all.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4093333}

The station was on the north side of the Round Oak Swing Bridge and opened in October 1837. It was designed by the architect Thomas Hinxman and built to the same design as the other stations along the route. It had low pitched roofs with curved eaves and was built of local red brick with stone dressings. The station was provided with a single track running from the Wolverhampton to Walsall line. The layout included a small goods yard, signal box and an exchange sidings. The station also served local collieries and iron works in the area. The station closed to passengers on 2 January 1917, but the goods yard and exchange sidings remained open until 30 April 1926. The site reverted back to agricultural land. The footbridge and signal box have both been preserved and relocated to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Trust’s head office in Gnosall.

It is the twenty-third film in the Pokémon universe, covering Generation VIII. The film returns to the series’ traditional 2D art style rather than using the CGI animation used in Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution. It features the new Generation VIII Mythical Pokémon Zarude and a shiny Celebi.\n\nIn Japan, the film was released on December 25, 2020, by Toho. The original release date of July 10, 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The film released worldwide (excluding Japan, Korea, and China) on Netflix on October 8, 2021.\n\nFor a limited time, if players of Pokémon Sword and Shield preordered tickets for this film's premiere, they would get the Mythical Pokémon Zarude in its \"Dada\" form and a Shiny Celebi.\n\nPlot\nIn the Forest of Okoya, the Mythical Pokémon Zarude finds an infant boy in a cradle washed up on a riverbank. Unable to leave the child on his own, Zarude adopts him as a son, giving him the name \"Koko\". Zarude leaves his tribe, which inhabits a Great Tree deep in the jungle where humans are forbidden to venture, to raise Koko who grows up as a feral child.\n\nTen years later, Ash Ketchum and Pikachu visit the Forest of Okoya from nearby Milyfa Town. While attempting to capture a wild Cramorant, Ash and Pikachu encounter a research team from the Biotope Company, a scientific organization studying the jungle. Team Rocket, covertly following them, look up information on the Biotope Company and its leader Dr. Zed, and decide to infiltrate the group.\n\nLater, Ash sees Koko go over a waterfall, after he got knocked out from a pipe while swinging on a vine with a wild Skwovet, and retrieves him from the water, bringing him to Milyfa Town's Pokémon Center for treatment. When Koko awakens, he becomes alarmed and escapes the building, having never seen other humans before. Discovering that Koko believes himself to be a Pokémon, Ash and Pikachu spend time with him in the town, helping him to learn about humans for the first time.\n\nAsh, Pikachu and Koko later encounter Zarude, who is forced to admit the truth about Koko's heritage. Zarude brings them to an abandoned laboratory he found shortly after adopting Koko, where he shows them a photograph he found of an infant Koko with his human parents. Zarude then leaves, returning to the Great Tree alone.\n\nDiscovering a wallet from Biotope Company, Ash brings Koko to their headquarters, where they meet with Dr. Zed. He reveals that Koko's parents are Chrom and Phossa Molybden, a pair of scientists who led the organization in researching the healing springs, and that Koko's real name is Al Molybden. However, Chrom and Phossa were killed in a car accident ten years ago, which was presumed to have killed Al as well. Dr. Zed scans Koko's pendant and discovers partially corrupted data on it that reveals an image of the Great Tree. Distraught over the news of his parents' fate, Koko flees to the Great Tree as well.\n\nAs soon as he reaches the Great Tree, Koko discovers a tracking chip planted on him by Dr. Zed. Zed arrives with his research team, which Team Rocket have infiltrated, along with a giant, spider-like tank. Koko and Ash try to stop Zed's actions, but he restrains them using his Ariados and throws them into the back of one of his trucks. He then fires missiles at the Great Tree, blasting open holes from which the spring water gushes forth. Ash, Pikachu and Koko escape with unwitting help from Team Rocket as they wrestle with the Cramorant from earlier and confront Dr. Zed, who suffers a psychotic breakdown and admits that, when Chrom and Phossa Molybden discovered the Great Tree's location but refused to continue researching it out of respect for the Zarude tribe, he killed the couple by running them off a road and stealing their supply of the spring water before leaving them to die in the explosion of their wrecked car. Before they perished, Chrom and Phossa sent the infant Al down the river with a drive containing the rest of their research, leading to Zarude finding him.\n\nDr. Zed seizes control of the tank from his henchmen, and Ash, Pikachu and Koko try to fight him to no avail. Zarude's tribe arrives, having been convinced to help save the jungle by Zarude who raised Koko. Koko's father figure also brings a group of wild Pokémon, who previously disliked his tribe due to their selfish behavior, to assist. Zarude is injured in the battle and nearly succumbs, but Koko manages to harness the power of the jungle as if he were indeed a Pokémon, healing him. With all their combined forces, they manage to break the tank's power source, disabling it. Zed attempts to escape, but is captured by Koko.\n\nIn the aftermath, the humans and Pokémon work together to restore the damage done to the jungle. Dr. Zed is arrested for his crimes and is loaded into a police van by Officer Jenny, based on evidence leaked by Team Rocket. Koko decides to leave to explore the human world and become the bridge between humans and Pokémon, taking the photograph of his parents along with him. As he and Ash leave the Forest of Okoya, they see Zarude turn the healing springs into a geyser to send Koko off. Cheered up by this, Koko goes forth into his future, embracing his dual identity as a Zarude and a human. At the Great Tree, Zarude who raised Koko sees a Shiny Celebi, which observes Zarude now living in harmony with the other Pokémon.\n\nVoice cast\n\nMusic\nPokémon the Movie: Koko Music Collection (Japanese: 「劇場版ポケットモンスター　ココ」ミュージックコレクション) is the official soundtrack of the movie that was released in Japan on December 23, 2020.

The film stars Ben Lee as the titular character, Placid Lake, an unconventional teenager struggling to fit in. Placid is a high school misfit whose ambition is to become \"normal\" and accepted by his peers. Half-hearted attempts at conforming however, don't do the trick and Placid's true individualism and talents eventually win out. The movie follows Placid as he is sent to an alternative school after being expelled from regular school for disruption. It's here that the title of the movie is taken literally, with Placid becoming increasingly angry at being referred to as a \"freak\", so he decides to take matters into his own hands. He swaps his colourful clothes for suits and becomes a major success, impressing everyone around him. Placid's newfound success however, is met with disapproval by those closest to him. His friend, Margy, dislikes his ambitious attitude, while Placid's parents, played by Garry McDonald and Miranda Richardson, think he's sold out. Ultimately though, the film isn't about ambition or fitting in but rather self discovery as Placid eventually realizes that the most important thing is being true to yourself regardless of what others think. The Rage in Placid Lake had it's world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2003, where it was met with enthusiastic responses from both audiences and critics. The film went on to win multiple awards, including Best Screenplay at the 2004 Australian Film Institute Awards.

He was the first president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nEarly life and education \nPalmer E. Pierce was born in Savanna, Illinois, to Henry C. Pierce and Laura Shepard. He was the second of three brothers. He grew up in Traer, Iowa, going on to attend Grinnell College and the US Military Academy at West Point, New York. He received his lieutenant's commission in 1891. He became athletic director at West Point for a short time in the early 1890s, managing the first Army football team.\n\nEarly service \nPierce first served in the Spanish–American War of 1898 during the Invasion of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the resurrection of the Philippines. He served during the Boxer Rebellion in 1899. In 1901 he graduated from the Army War College and the school of the line and the staff class at Fort Leavenworth.\n\nPierce was the first president of the NCAA, taking office in 1906. At the first organizational meeting in December 1905, he emphasized the importance of \"home rule\", which allowed any institutions that joined the NCAA to still keep their independence. He was a severe critic of the \"old\" rules committee, saying that they were \"a self-constituted, self-perpetuating and irresponsible body, which, in order to make the rules more favorable to the playing area available at particular institutions, had degraded a once noble sport to a brutal gladitorial contest\".\n\nHe served in the Villa Expedition in 1916.\n\nService \n\nIn 1917, Pierce became an aide to United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. On one occasion after the declaration of war, when Pierce appeared before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss how to spend the three billion dollars requested to send to the War Department, he declared: \"Clothing, cots, camps, food, pay … And we may have to have an army in France!\". \"Good Lord!\" said Virginian Senator Thomas S. Martin. \"You're not going to send soldiers over there, are you?\" Pierce became the Director of Purchases for the War Industries Board after its establishment in 1917.\n\nIn the later half of 1917 to the early part of 1918, Pierce served as commander of the 27th Infantry Division and the 54th Infantry Regiment. While he was under British command, he was ordered to the Battle of Bellecourt; there the Australians provided invaluable supplies and lessons, including hot meals to the front lines, given the lack of supplies on the front line. In late 1918, he became the Assistant Chief of Staff of the AEF. He was promoted to brigadier general and earned two Distinguished Service Medal and the British Order of the Bath for his actions as the commander of the respective formations.\n\nDeath and legacy \nAfter retiring from the Army, Pierce became an assistant to the President of the Standard Oil Company. He died in New York City on January 17, 1940.\n\nHis widow, Agnes Young Pierce (1870-1961), left a bequest of $1 million to the Association of Graduates of West Point, which was used to establish the Palmer E.

Sheehy had been working as a solo singer/songwriter for several years when he met Alex Vald and Laurence Ash, who quickly began writing songs with Sheehy.  Upon the demise of another local group, Breed, bassist Andrew Park joined. The band's name came from a news story Sheehy had seen about an arsonist who had burned down a members-only porno theatre. They played their first gig as Dream City Film Club on 31 July 1995.\n\nThey released a single, \"Crawl\" for the underground fanzine, the Organ in early 1996.  Soon after, they were contacted by Beggar's Banquet and recorded their eponymous debut album in late 1996, later releasing it on 26 May 1997.\n\nAccording to Sheehy, the English press reaction to the first single, \"Perfect Piece of Trash\", was almost unanimous in its derision.  After parting with Vald, DCFC continued on as a three piece, recording its second and final album, In the Cold Light of Morning featuring a more expansive sound best realized on the epic \"God Will Punish the Pervert Preacher\".\n\nThe group disbanded in 1999.  Michael J. Sheehy subsequently recorded three solo albums for Beggar's Banquet and two for Glitterhouse, and has fronted Saint Silas Intercession with his brother Patrick. During the early 2000s, Alex Vald worked as half of experimental pop band Datapuddle. In 2015, Sheehy and Vald reunited as the pop-noir duo United Sound of Joy.\n\nIn a retrospective biography of the group, AllMusic called them \"one of England's most underrated bands of the 1990s.\"\n\nLine-up\nMichael J.

The observatory is currently owned by Turun Ursa ry, a local astronomical association operating in Turku area. The buildings of the observatory include an observatory dome, a zenith observatory, and a house for recording observations.\n\nKevola Observatory has code 064 in the IAU/MPC observatory list. The main-belt asteroid 1540 Kevola was named after the observatory.\n\nHistory \n\nThe observatory was built in 1963 by Tähtitieteellis-optillinen seura (Astronomy-Optical Society) on a small hill on lands of the home farm of Hilkka Rantaseppä-Helenius. She worked at the time as an observer at Tuorla Observatory of University of Turku. The association was founded by Yrjö Väisälä, Liisi Oterma, Hilkka Rantaseppä-Helenius, and other astronomers working at University of Turku.\n\nThe association was terminated in 1983. In 1986 the observatory building was passed to Turun Ursa, also founded by Yrjö Väisälä. The land of the observatory was rented from a local farmer until 2002, when Turun Ursa received a grant from Viljo, Yrjö ja Kalle Väisälän rahasto (Viljo, Yrjö and Kalle Väisälä Fund) to purchase the land.\n\nAstronomical instruments \n\nThe observatory dome houses a 50 cm anastigmatic Schmidt-Väisälä camera, which was earlier located at Iso-Heikkilä Observatory, where it was used in an asteroid hunt to find 807 minor planets and 7 comets. The telescope has a 50 cm corrector menisculus and a 60 cm primary mirror with focal length of 1031 mm. It has a 6.7 degree field of view on 12x12 cm film plates, making it ideal for searching asteroids. Attached to the main telescope are two guide telescopes: an 18 cm and an 8 cm refractor.\n\nThe zenith tower originally housed a 250/5150 mm zenith telescope that was used to observe the movements of the axis of the earth. After the Tähtitieteellis-optillinen seura was ended, the telescope was moved to Tuorla Observatory. As the zenith tower does not have a dome but a roof that opens to the sides, and has therefore little use for normal observations, it remains unused.\n\nSee also \n List of astronomical observatories\n List of observatory codes\n Tuorla Observatory\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Women of Learning Website\n\nAstronomical observatories in Finland\nPaimio\nBuildings and structures in Southwest Finland\nAstronomy-optics society", "machine_text": " Kevola Observatory is an astronomical observatory located in northern Europe, near the town of Kevola in Finland.

It encourages people to write a letter to oneself, answering questions often thought about but rarely discussed, such as \"what do you want to be remembered for?\", or \"what changes should you make?\". The concept was inspired by the healthy habit of writing down one's feelings in a journal. The members of Foorin, Mone Kamishiraishi and Yuta Iiyama, have encouraged their fans to also take up the challenge of Dear Myself. The duo posts regular videos on their YouTube channel, giving detailed instructions on how to write the letter. In each video, the members of Foorin define two types of questions for the letter. The first type are “Background Questions”, which are questions that focus on the writer's values and priorities. The second type are “Action Questions”, which are questions that focus on changes that the writer would like to make in the near future. The letters written should be a synthesis of the answers to these two types of questions. The message behind Dear Myself is that one should be honest with oneself and not shy away from difficult questions. This will lead to a better understanding of the individual and the ability to make thoughtful decisions in the future. In their videos, Foorin encourages people to think more deeply about their lives, take steps to make positive changes, and live life to the fullest. Recently, the Dear Myself concept has become extremely popular in Japan, with the hashtag #DearMyself trending on Twitter and more and more people sharing their letters with the world. Thanks to Foorin's initiative, people have found a way to express their aspirations and goals, and receive emotional support from their peers in the process.

Built in 1878, and designed by local engineers Craven and Mark, it is the oldest surviving bridge in Newcastle and one of the oldest historic road bridges in the North of England. It is a Grade II* Listed Building by Historic England. The bridge crosses the River Tyne between the neighbourhoods of Jesmond and Heaton, east of the city centre, and is positioned slightly north of the Redheugh Bridge. It originally served as a southwards extension of Wingrove Road, carrying the B1351 road, but has since been closed to vehicular traffic. Kingsland Bridge is a two-span, wrought iron and masonry structure, featuring two parabolic arches, each one built with 400 tonnes of Welsh granite. The arches span a distance of 36 metres, creating a total width of 18 metres, rising far above its original foundation. At the end of the 19th century, Kingsland Bridge became a centre of community and leisure activities. A pedestrian pathway was added in the 1920s, which allowed relative freedom of movement until it was closed off to pedestrians again in the early 1990s, due to its increasing dilapidation. Despite its closure, the bridge has slowly been refurbished, in order to preserve it as a historic site. In recent years, a number of facelifts have been applied, including the installation of new lighting, balustrades and fencing, and aesthetic restoration to the masonry. Nowadays, Kingsland Bridge is a popular destination for tourists and local enthusiasts alike. Situated in a scenic area with the River Tyne running directly underneath, many people stop to appreciate its architecture and observe the river's surrounding views. As part of the regeneration project in Newcastle, several initiatives have proposed the opening of the bridge to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. If implemented, these plans could potentially reinvigorate the area and would likely increase the number of visitors to an already unique site.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6799342}

The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its historic importance.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Polvorín was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly, who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III. Among O'Reilly's recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvorín) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770 and others as 1776.\n\nWhen the Spanish–American War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvorín de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population.\n\nSince the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa Bárbara Chapel.\n\nWhen the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nEventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles. With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.\n\nSee also\n\n List of communities in Puerto Rico\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Ruins of Miraflores Magazine and Isla Grande\n\nMagazines (artillery)\nBuildings and structures in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nBuildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico\nNational Register of Historic Places in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nMilitary facilities on the National Register of Historic Places\nSpanish Colonial architecture in Puerto Rico", "machine_text": " Polvorín de Miraflores is a 17th-century fort in the Extremadura region of western Spain. It was built at the beginning of the 17th century by order of Philip III, to protect the borders of the province of Badajoz from the potential incursion of foes from Portugal. The fort is located in the municipality of Miraflores de la Sierra, close to the border with Portugal, and it stands on top of a mountain within the Sierra Morena region. It has a triangular shape, with its walls built in stone and rammed earth. Inside the fort, there are three independent structures that are interconnected via a short access way. The Polvorín was refurbished in the 1730s, with improvements made to fortify it in the event of looming conflict. Additionally, a wall was built alongside the structure in order to provide easy access to the various structures. Visitors of the Polvorín can appreciate its long and tumultuous history, which dates back to the 16th century. Moreover, the Polvorín is an important part of Spanish heritage as it is one of the few remaining examples of the country's Hispanic-Moorish history. The complex is made up of three structures, all interconnected by a corredor; the hovel has a two-meter-thick wall and can be accessed via a staircase, the central structure houses a cistern and has a capacity of 45,000 liters of water, and the third structure features several houses. In spite of the traditional beauty of the Polvorín, its military function ended long ago, and despite having been declared an Asset of Cultural Interest in 1990, its current state requires some vital restoration works in order to be restored to its former glory. In 2013, a project was established to commence the restoration works of the Polvorín, in spite of the challenging economic and technical difficulties. This project was similar to another carried out a few years before, both of which contain plans focused on restoring the structure and its original annexes. Presently, the Polvorín de Miraflores still holds a place of significant heritage-value in Spain, although its most notable past as a military fort is long over. Although the fort's restoration is still not completed, it remains an important haunting reminder of Spain's rich architectural heritage.

He was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the first trip from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. He was the only animal to complete the entire trip, which took 3 years.\n\nSeaman was purchased in 1803 specifically for the expedition by Captain Meriwether Lewis, while he was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, awaiting completion of the boats for the voyage. He chose a Newfoundland, whose estimated weight is  and for which he paid the high price of $20 (): half a month's pay for an Army captain. Working dogs, strong and easy to handle—Lewis describes Seaman as \"docile\"—, he chose a Newfoundland because they do well on boats, are good swimmers, and can assist in water rescues. His name reflects this.\n\nWe have no description of Seaman's color or appearance. He is nowadays universally depicted as black or dark brown, the colors of most modern Newfoundlands, but a survey by an art historian of the breed as it was depicted in paintings of the early nineteenth century found \"not a single all-black [that] was called a Newfoundland\". \"In fact, all the early 19th century illustrations which I have found, and whose color I could authenticate[,] were white with black or dark areas and frecklings.\"\n\nSeaman on the expedition\nSeaman did many things to help the explorers, and they became fond of him. He was \"our dog\".\n\nHe also retrieved geese and deer, and once killed and retrieved an antelope swimming across a river.\n\nAccording to Lewis and Clark's report, some Native Americans were impressed by the dog's \"sagacity\" (wisdom, obedience); they had never seen such a big dog. The dog \"patrolled all night\" to warn of bears, and once had to drive off a buffalo in their camp while the men slept.\n\nA modern commentator on the Expedition remarked that \"Lewis seems to have been happiest when he was alone on shore with his gun, his notebook, and his dog Seaman.\"\n\nDuring the expedition, around May 14, 1805, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark performed surgery on one of Seaman's arteries in his hind leg that had been severed by a beaver bite. In early 1806, as the expedition was beginning the return journey, Seaman was stolen by Indians and Lewis sent three men to retrieve the dog.  Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery ate over 200 dogs, bought from the Indians, while traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail, in addition to their horses, but Seaman was spared.\n\nThe final reference to Seaman in the expedition journals, recorded by Lewis on July 15, 1806, states that \"[T]he musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist. for my own part I am confined by them to my bier at least 3/4 of the time. My dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them.\"\n\nSeaman after the expedition\nSeaman survived the expedition, and Lewis took the dog home with him to St. Louis. He is reported to have refused food and died of grief after Lewis's premature death.\n\nSeaman's inscribed collar was once in an Alexandria, D.C., museum:\n\nThe greatest traveller of my speciesMy name is SEAMANthe dog of captain Meriwether Lewiswhom I accompanied to the Pacific Oceanthrough the interior of the continent of North America\n\nThe mistaken name \"Scannon\"\n\nDue to a transcription error in Lewis' journals, the dog was once thought to have been named Scannon. However, during Donald Jackson's 1984 study of Lewis and Clark place-names in Montana—every expedition member got something named after him—he found that Lewis had named a tributary of the Blackfoot River Seaman’s Creek (now Monture Creek) and concluded that the true name of the dog was \"Seaman\".\n\nHonors\nIn 2008, Seaman became the official mascot of Lewis & Clark College's Pioneers.

The mascot, who has been known as Seaman or Sea Dog, is believed to have been the first official mascot of the US Navy. In 1998, Seaman was adopted from a pet shop in Washington D.C. by Master Chief Robert Johnston of the USS Wasp. Seaman quickly became a favorite of the crew onboard the Wasp due to his friendly and attentive nature, eventually being officially adopted as the ship's mascot. He was also assigned an official military rank of Chief Dog. Seaman quickly endeared himself to all of the enlisted personnel onboard the ship and he quickly earned the nickname \"The Gentleman Sailor\". Seaman accompanied the USS Wasp on multiple deployments, including visits to the Mediterranean, Haiti, and Guantanamo Bay. During the deployment to Haiti, Seaman assisted in the pre-deployment strategy; his daily patrols of the ship's decks startled the Haitian thieves who had been stealing the ship's supplies. He was also known to calm angry guards at Guantanamo when they saw a friendly dog rather than a mere intruder. Seaman was a steady presence in the US Navy for almost 10 years, remaining aboard the USS Wasp throughout its appointments. When the USS Wasp was decommissioned in 2004, Seaman crossed the globe one more time with the crew on her final voyage. On October 21, 2006, Seaman was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors; shortly thereafter, the Navy recognized Seaman as the Navy's official mascot canine. A bronze statue in honor of Seaman stands near the grave of his owner, Master Chief Robert Johnston. The US Navy has since retired the mascot dog position in respect for Seaman. Today, Seaman is remembered not only for his contribution to the US Navy and his loyal service but for his exceptional canine character.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4317451}

Named to the North Carolina Council of State in 1824, Owen returned to the state senate in 1827 but was elected Governor by the General Assembly in December 1828, narrowly defeating Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. in a vote of 96 to 92.\n\nOwen served two consecutive one-year terms as governor, during which he promoted education and served concurrently as President of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. He was nominated for a third term as governor, but declined the nomination; that same year, he lost by one vote (to Willie Mangum) a bid to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate.\n\nIn 1835, Owen was a prominent member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention; there, he supported enfranchisement of land-owning Negro citizens and opposed religious tests for officeholders.\n\nAlthough during his earlier political life, Owen affiliated himself with the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, in 1839, he presided over the first state convention of the emerging Whig Party; three weeks later, he served as president of the National Whig Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

He was born in the Chatham County and moved to the Randolph County later in his life. Owen was an advocate for the rights of the state in the early 19th century and sought to defend North Carolina's sovereignty from what he and others believed to be encroachments from the federal government. Owen attended and graduated from Yale College in 1790, and moved around doing work in law, teaching, and in other professions. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1804 representing Montgomery County and served for four consecutive terms, becoming the Speaker of the House in 1808. In 1809, he left the House of Commons due to an appointment by President James Madison to become the Register in Bankruptcy of the Western District of North Carolina. He then moved to Johnson County where he became a farmer and operated a successful business. In 1810, Owen was again elected to the House of Commons to represent Randolph County. Owen was voted out at the next election in 1812, but was re-elected in 1814 and 1816. In 1818 and 1820, he lost the elections yet got elected in 1822, 1824 and 1826. During his time in the House of Commons, he supported freedom of speech, personal liberty, and judicial reform. He was also a supporter of education and was a proponent of the establishment of a state college, which was ultimately established as the University of North Carolina. Owen's political life was troubled by federal efforts to usurp state power. He opposed the Tariff of Abominations in 1828, which angered conservative forces within the state and ultimately cost him an election in 1832 when he ran to regain his seat in the House of Commons. He also sided with Governor Hutchins B. Godwin against the federal government as a leader of the 1832 Nullification Crisis by signing a resolution ordering the arrest of federal officers who did not respect the state's rights on land matters. Despite his accusations of being an extremist, John Owen was an important figure in the early 19th Century push to assert North Carolina's sovereignty. He served seven terms in the state House of Commons and was a passionate advocate for the rights of North Carolinians.

She was laid down at the Deutsche Werft in Hamburg as yard number 367 on 6 August 1942, launched on 17 March 1943 and commissioned on 2 June 1943 under Oberleutnant zur See Paul Just. The U-boat was a member of three wolfpacks.\n\nU-546 was responsible for the last combat sinking of a United States Navy vessel in the Atlantic Theatre, during Operation Teardrop. On 24 April 1945 U-546 sank the destroyer escort , but was in turn sunk by combined fire of five other US destroyers. Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station. It was from this crew that the USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nDesign\nGerman Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-546 had a displacement of  when at the surface and  while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of  for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two  propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of  and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for  at ; when surfaced, she could travel  at . U-546 was fitted with six  torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one  SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a  SK C/30 as well as a  C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.\n\nSensors\n\nRadar\nU-546 was one of the few U-boats that was fitted with a FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U Radar Transmitter. It was installed on the starboard side of the conning tower.\n\nRadar Detection\nU-546 was fixed with the FuMB-26 Tunis antenne. The FuMB 26 Tunis combined the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted in either the Direction Finder Antenna Loop and separately on the bridge.\n\nService history\n\nShe commenced her training on 2 June 1943, making her first silent run at Sønderborg, she remained with the 4th U-boat Flotilla (training) at Stettin until 31 December 1943. She completed her training with a voyage from Hela to Swinemünde to practice A.A. cannon fire.\n\nFirst patrol\nThe boat was reassigned to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for combat duties in the Atlantic on 1 January 1944, departing Kiel on 22 January 1944, with a three-day stopover at Marvika in Norway. After forming up with the Gruppe Igel 1 (Group Hedgehog) north-west of Scotland on 3 February 1944, U-546 commenced a patrol in the North Atlantic with other boats to the west of Ireland on anti-convoy duties. At 12:29 on 16 February U-546 reported she had been attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat from No. 201 Squadron RAF, killing one crewman. On 20 February 1944 she was again attacked by an aircraft. On 17 April while returning to base in France, the U-boat was caught on the surface by a Leigh light -equipped Liberator of 53 Squadron in the Bay of Biscay, steaming south-east, ahead of convoy HX 278 and was attacked with depth charges, but ended up shooting down the attacker with the 3.7 cm gun. She returned to Lorient for service and refit on 23 or 25 April 1944. The crew was given leave while the boat was overhauled and the Schnorchel was fitted.\n\nSecond patrol\nLeaving her base again on 15 June 1944 for her second patrol to the African Gold Coast, she was detected by a USN anti-submarine patrol, which begun to hunt her. She soon had to abort her patrol and was ordered to return to Germany after the invasion of Normandy. On 18 June 1944 U-546 was attacked, again by a Sunderland, which was not equipped with radar. The boat then briefly returned to France on 22 June to replenish her cannon ammunition, sailing again on 25 June. On 20 July 1944 she was detected by USN surface ships forming the escort for an escort carrier; U-546 fired a torpedo at the carrier, but missed and was subjected to three hours of depth charge attacks from the escort destroyers. She managed to escape this attack. U-546 was then ordered to patrol a zone near Cape Verde where she operated for about four weeks, attacking a convoy with a spread of three torpedoes, but scoring no hits.\n\nDuring the second patrol due to fuel shortages the captain achieved significant fuel saving and extended the cruise to 150 days (the boat's longest patrol), by floating submerged for days on water-layers with all engines stopped. The boat returned to base with 30 metric tons of fuel left.\n\nThird patrol\nOn 10 November 1944 U-546 was reassigned to the 33rd U-boat Flotilla based at Flensburg, where she received a 14-day overhaul, eventually departing Kristiansand in Norway, on 2 March 1945. The boat proceeded to the eastern coast of North America on 10 March 1945 with six companions. In mid-April the group was ordered to commence operations individually. On 23 April the submarine was spotted surfacing north-west of the Azores by aircraft from  as part of Operation Teardrop. The planes were looking for U-boats carrying V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, which intelligence suggested were going to be used to attack American cities. Depth charges were dropped just after the boat submerged, but failed to damage her hull.\n\nSinking\n\nOn 24 April 1945, U-546 made contact with the destroyer escort  and proceeded to attack, firing a stern torpedo. The destroyer turned into it and was hit, which tore the DE apart and sent her down with heavy loss of life.\n\nThe U-boat was in turn pursued by other destroyer escorts; , , , , ,  , , and . Neunzer and  conducted a search while Pillsbury circled the area and Flaherty picked up survivors. Flaherty made contact in less than an hour and with Pillsbury proceeded to attack. The U-boat went to . Contact was lost from 10:45 until 12:01 when Varian, Janssen and Hubbard began another attack. Neunzer got into the fight after several attacks by the other DE's, delivering a creeping attack with Varian and Hubbard while Chatelain directed. Contact was lost once more at about 16:00, so Chatelain and Neunzer were ordered to return to the scouting line.\n\nThe line was expanded, the ships began a sweep through the area, determined to prevent the submarine's escape. Varian made contact once more at 17:31 and Flaherty was ordered to attack. She fired at 18:10. Four minutes later a small oil slick began coming to the surface. Flaherty made another Hedgehog attack at 18:28, and at 18:38 the U-boat broke the surface.\n\nEvery ship in the line within range began firing. At 18:44, after more than ten and a half hours of attacks, U-546 rolled under and sank (in position , south-south-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland). Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station, Newfoundland. Eight of the surviving, captured crewmen of U-546 were tortured by US military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U-546's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly get information on what the U.S. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental US by German submarines. The USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nWolfpacks\nU-546 took part in three wolfpacks, namely:\n Igel 1 (9 – 17 February 1944) \n Hai 1 (17 – 22 February 1944) \n Seewolf (14 – 24 April 1945)\n\nSummary of raiding history\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nY'Blood, William T., Hunter-killer : U.S. escort carriers in the Battle of the Atlantic, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 1983. \nSyrett, David, Failure at Sea: Wolf Pack Operations in the North Atlantic, 10 February-22 March 1944 \"The Northern Mariner\", V, No. 1 (January 1995), 33–43.\n\nFurther reading\nNiestle, Axel, German U-Boat Losses During World War II. 1998.\nBlair, Clay, Hitler's U-boat War, 1996.\nBlair, Clay, Hitler's U-boat War, Vol II, 1998.\nWynn, Kenneth, U-Boat Operations of the Second World War – Vol 1, 1998.\nWynn, Kenneth, U-Boat Operations of the Second World War – Vol 2, 1998.\nJust, Paul, Vom Seeflieger zum U-Boot-Fahrer, 1982.\n\nExternal links\n\nGerman Type IX submarines\nWorld War II submarines of Germany\nU-boats sunk in 1945\nU-boats sunk by US warships\nWorld War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean\nU-boats commissioned in 1943\n1943 ships\nShips built in Hamburg\nMaritime incidents in April 1945", "machine_text": " German submarine U-546 was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down on 15 October 1940 at the Deutsche Werke (commonly known as Kriegsmarinewerft) yard at Kiel, launched on 17 August 1941, commissioned on 7 November, and commanded by Kapitänleutnant Henrich Bleichrodt. U-546 had a short career and conducted four combat patrols, sinking two merchant ships of 7,028 long tons (7,150 t). She was a member of six wolfpacks. U-546s first patrol began 15 April 1942 when she departed Kiel for the North Atlantic. She sank a Greek and an Italian merchant ship totaling over 6,000 long ton (6,100 t). During the patrol, she was part of a temporary breakaway wolf pack named Pfadfinder that sank the British Armed Merchant Cruiser HMS Voltaire. The second patrol started 19 December 1942 and lasted until the end of March 1943. U-546 was part of five wolfpacks, Kreuzotter, Oder, Hauptmann Stegmann, Steubens and Kurfürst. She had no success. U-546s third patrol began 11 June 1943 when she left St. Nazaire, France, and headed for the North Atlantic. The wolfpacks in which U-546 operated included Albin, Eisbär, Benecke, and Neuland. U-546 torpedoed and sank the Norwegian freighter SS Arosa on 23 June 1943 while en route to Reykjavík, Iceland. U-546s fourth and final patrol began on 24 February 1944 and ended on 25 April. While patrolling in the North Atlantic and north of Ireland, she was part of two wolf packs, Jagd and Drossel. U-546 sank one British merchant ship of over 1,000 long ton (1,016 t) in the Bay of Biscay before heading back to Germany. On 25 April 1944 U-546 was spotted by a British aircraft north of Spain and depth-charged by the British destroyers HMS Liddesdale and HMS Obdurate. U-546 sunk to the bottom and her entire crew of 48 sailors was lost. After the war her wreck was found off Finisterre where it has been determined by experts from Spain’s Naval War College that she was attacked by a combination of aerial and surface torpedo attacks based on a thorough analysis of the wreckage. It has been identfied as U-546 due to the presence of the U-boat's number on the remains. ", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24270142}

The first female lawyers to practice law in Missouri were Theodocia Pruitt and Caroline D. Hougherty, both of which were admitted to the Missouri Bar on 1919 and 1923, respectively. Theodocia Pruitt was born in 1882, in Cassville, Missouri, but moved to Kansas City for her studies where she graduated from the University of Kansas City School of Law in 1919. She was a powerful opponent of Jim Crow laws in Missouri, a strong supporter of women's rights and a leader in initiatives to bring African American attorneys through the Missouri Bar to practice law. Caroline D. Houghton was born in St. Louis in 1887 and graduated from Washington University School of Law in 1923. She was the first woman in Missouri to receive the law degree and succeeded in having a law practice. She was an associate attorney with her father Benjamin F. Houghton and was permitted to have her own practice in 1926. In 1927, she became the first woman in St. Louis to enter a jury trial as an attorney. The first African American female lawyer in Missouri was Carrie K. Anthony, who was also the first African American woman to be admitted to practice law in the United States. She was admitted to the Missouri Bar in 1927, and was the only female African American attorney until the 1950s. During her career, she championed civil rights issues and successfully argued before the United States Supreme Court for the reinstatement of the Missouri governor. Following this, other female lawyers such as Julia Brownlee Peavey, Louise Kayser and Phyllis Smith worked tirelessly to establish legal precedents and gained recognition in the legal field. Eventually, in 1957, Lillian Hatcher became the first female judge in Missouri, when she was elected Municipal Judge in Kansas City. She served in this position until 1963, when she was succeeded by Martha Hill who became the first African American female judge in Missouri. In the modern-day legal landscape, the list of first female lawyers and judges in Missouri continues to inspire a new wave of female lawyers. The increasing numbers of female lawyers in Missouri greatly improves representation for women in the courtroom and parity in legal proceedings. These first women lawyers and judges in Missouri opened doors for future generations of female lawyers and indeed for all members of the legal profession. This article has so far provided a short overview of some of the pioneering women in Missouri who have shaped the legal landscape of the state from the early twentieth century onwards. Their tireless and important contributions to the legal field continue to be a lasting legacy and an inspiration for those who follow in their footsteps. References # Price, J.E. (1990).

The surviving central shrine holds an image of dancing Shiva; all the Yogini images are, uniquely, similarly shown dancing.\n\nTemple\n\nThe Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century in Ranipur-Jharial, in an isolated position some miles from the towns of Titilagarh and Kantabanjhi in Balangir district, Odisha, is a circular, hypaethral, 64-yogini temple made of sandstone, some 50 feet in diameter. 62 of the yogini images survive. The site, on an outcrop of rock, must have been important, given the presence of a large temple built of brick and several small temples of stone. The primary entrance is an opening in the circular wall towards the east; unlike at the Hirapur yogini temple, there was once a further opening towards the south, now filled in.\n\nRanipur-Jharial was the first of the Yogini temples to be discovered; it was described by Major-General John Campbell in 1853.\n\nShrine to Shiva and Chamunda\n\nAt the centre of the temple is the original shrine with four pillars, holding an image of Nateshwar, Shiva as Lord of Dance. The Shiva images is three-faced and eight-armed, and is depicted with urdhva linga, an erection. Elephant-headed Ganesh and the bull Nandi are shown in the image's base. The similar-sized image of the goddess Chamunda in the temple may once have been housed with Shiva in the central shrine.\n\nYogini images\n\nThe Ranipur Jharial Yoginis are made, like the temple walls, of a low-quality coarse sandstone, which has weathered poorly; they were once finely-carved. Uniquely, all the Yogini images are depicted poised about to dance, in the karana pose of Indian classical dance; Vidya Dehejia explains that the posture is taken up at the start of each group of movements. Like the Hirapur temple, but unlike other Yogini temples, there are no Matrikas, mother goddesses, among the Yoginis. 14 of the Yoginis are animal-headed; among them can be seen goddesses with the heads of a cat, an elephant, a snake, a horse, a buffalo, an antelope, and seemingly also of a leopard and a sow. The leopard-headed goddess is holding up a human corpse, suggestive of the corpse rituals (shava sadhana) of the Yogini cult. The absence of haloes or attendant figures as at later Yogini temples suggests that this temple was built relatively early.\n\nThe 19th century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham described two further Yogini images. One, uniquely, had the attributes of the Sun-god, Surya; she had two arms, a lotus flower in each hand, and seven horses. The other (now surviving only from the knees down) was dancing on a reclining male; she had 6 or 8 arms, and was depicted pulling her mouth open wide; she held a skull-cup, a kettle-drum, and a sword.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n  \n\nHindu temples in Odisha\nBalangir district\n9th-century_Hindu_temples\nArchaeological monuments in Odisha\nShakti temples", "machine_text": " The Chausath Yogini Temple, located in the village of Ranipur Jharial in the Indian state of Odisha, is one of the most important archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent. It is believed to have been built sometime during the eighth century CE and is dedicated to the goddess Mahishamardini. The temple is most notable for being the only surviving example of an octagonal temple from this era. It is also one of the few temples dedicated to the worship of the goddess Mahishamardini. It is also the only temple that has a full octagon instead of the usual partial octagon. The main temple consists of a shrine and a sanctum, both of which are surrounded by sixty-four freestanding shrines, all of which are dedicated to the Chausath Yogini or the sixty-four yoginis. Each of these shrines is intricately carved and is purported to contain a representation of a specific yogini. The design of the temple is unique and is considered to be one of the most important examples of the Nagara style of architecture. The entrance gate is adorned with brahma and gandhara sculptures and is believed to be symbolic of the goddess Mahishamardini's struggle against the demon Mahishasura. The main temple is constructed entirely of stone and brick, and consists of a single chamber. It has an open plan with a central raised platform with four columns, each topped with a carved capital. This platform is surrounded by sixteen small, devotional shrines, each facing an entrance gate. The design of the temple is intricately detailed and includes several carvings related to the teachings of Shaivism. The temple also has a few sculpted panels, which depict stories from Hindu mythology and the ramayana. These carvings serve as a reminder of the importance of mythology in Odisha culture. The Chausath Yogini temple has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and is popularly referred to as the 'Sixty-four Yogini Temple' as it is one of the most important sites from the Pala-Sena era. The temple is an important example of the religious, cultural and archaeological heritage of India and is an important centre of tourist attraction.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63363817}

Club gave the episode a \"B+\" rating and wrote, \"But to focus entirely on that joke also runs the risk of devaluing 'Breakfast In Bed,' which is a sturdy Grimm episode even without bringing that into play. It manages to juggle its humorous beats in a story that's ripe with darker and invasive themes, and manages not to devalue either of them as it moves through the mystery. It also takes some welcome steps to advance the ongoing plots, not so much providing clarity as renewing interest in what comes next.\"\n\nKathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 2 star rating out of 5, stating: \"And this season started out so well. It's so immensely frustrating to have such rich potential squandered so badly, as in Grimm Season 6 Episode 6. Unfortunately, this episode was really quite disappointing on a number of levels that I was literally left wondering what in the world I was just watching. Oi.\"\n\nSara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \"A\" rating and wrote, \"This was a fun little entry in the monster-of-the-week cannon that also plays into those ancient fears of sleep paralysis.

That's some delicious foreshadowing as we hit the midpoint of Grimms final season.\"\n\nTV.com, wrote, \"Well, 'Breakfast in Bed' wasn't as bad as last week. But it was a near thing. Part of it is because it had even less subplotting than 'The Seven Year Itch.' Renard's issues with Meisner take up about five minutes. Admittedly, there's no mention of Renard's visit to the 'spirit vacuum' last week, and it doesn't seem to have had any impact on anything, hallucinated or real.\"\n\nChristine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \"We're almost halfway through the final season and many fans might be starting to feel a little perplexed. Despite having only seven episodes left in which to wrap up the entire series – and deliver a finale that is worthy of its own mythological status – right now Grimm is still seemingly content to amble along at a leisurely pace, designating all the interesting plot points to the background while it focuses yet again on a standard Wesen-of-the-week storyline.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2017 American television episodes\nGrimm (season 6) episodes", "machine_text": " Breakfast in Bed (Grimm) is an episode of Grimm, an American supernatural drama series on NBC.

The company streamlines the process by offering online and in-home design assistance as well as single shipment delivery of all products needed for the bathroom remodel. Often referred to as bathroom in a box, they also arrange for the installation of all products through their network of Bath Simple Certified Contractors and offer a zero waste recycling program.\n\nHistory\n\nBased in Richmond, California, Bath Simple was launched by John Crowley and Bill Hunscher in 2010. The idea came from the difficulty that both faced in remodeling their bathrooms, as they had to deal with numerous suppliers and contractors to complete their projects. There was no predictability in either the price of the bathroom remodel, or the time required to complete the job. The company was founded to streamline the process for bathroom remodeling by allowing consumers to have a single place to coordinate all of their project details from design through installation. Both saw a problem not with the products, but the process used to select the products and deliver them to consumers. The concept behind Bath Simple was to leverage a “curated” line of high quality bathroom products combined with a high-touch design experience to make the process easier for consumers to design their bathrooms, order/receive their products, and have the installation delivered  from a single source.\n\nIn 2011, Bath Simple expanded into the San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Boston, and New York markets. The financing for the expansion came from Blueshift Partners, LLC, and additional angel investors and industry partners.\n\nProcess\n\nThe Bath Simple process starts online at their website where a customer can learn about the company and peruse the product catalogue and  design ideas. Once a customer is ready to begin the design process, they answer a few questions about style and budget, whereupon the company arranges a free in-home consultation with a Bath Simple Certified Designer. Once the design is finalized, Bath Simple has all of the materials sent to their warehouse and then packaged in a box. The box is then sent to the customer as opposed to the customer receiving numerous boxes from numerous different manufacturers.\n\nBath Simple pairs each customer with a local Bath Simple Certified Contractor for installation of their projects. Upon completion of a project, Bath Simple allows customers to place all of the old items from their bathroom in the box and ship it back to them to be recycled and/or disposed of responsibly.\n\nSee also\n\n Disruptive innovation\n Renovation\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Bath Simple on MSNBC\n Bathroom Renovations and Bathroom Remodels Sydney\n\nCompanies based in Richmond, California\nAmerican companies established in 2010\n2010 establishments in California", "machine_text": " Bath Simple (often referred to as Bath Sim) is a lifestyle brand that specializes in the design and production of bath products.

At that time the DJ confessed to him that he was writing the song from afar with Dean Lewis. A few days later, the singer came to Amsterdam, Netherlands to finish writing it and start recording it. When he arrived on 17 June, Garrix and Lewis shared their meeting with their fans by posting a photo of themselves on Instagram. It showed them in a short boat hanging out by the water canals in Amsterdam and was accompanied by the comment \"I live for days like this!\" left by Garrix. In the studio, Lewis played the role of singer and guitarist. He had just finished a long tour that injured his voice, which led him to save it for the second day of recordings and start by recording his guitar parts. He later claimed that the chorus of \"Used to Love\" is one of the highest vocal lines and that the single is one of the most challenging ones he has worked on. When he recorded his vocals he was led to make several attempts to get the right vocal balance and the right notes without forcing his voice. During the following months, both artists were busy creating new music in Garrix's studio based in Amsterdam. Then, from 7 to 8 September was taking place Garrix's fifth anniversary of Lollapalooza Berlin. It was at this time that the DJ officially revealed that the song was set to be released at the end of October. To accompany his announcement, he added, \"This track was made during my break while I was recovering from my ankle injury. Dean and I are super excited to share it with the world!\" On 25 October, he posted via his social media the cover of the song, unveiling its release date. After the release, Dean Lewis talked about his collaboration, saying:\n\nGarrix felt it was amazing to make the song with Lewis, who he considers as \"a good friend and an exciting talent\". He added that the singer wrote deeply personal lyrics accompanied by a timeless style of music during the development of the track.\n\nCritical reception \nKatie Bain of Billboard wrote that Garrix and Lewis paid homage to American singer Bruce Springsteen with the lyrics \"we had Springsteen playing so loud\" in their track. She felt the song swelling and compelling \"in the same style as many of Springsteen's biggest and most grandiose hits\", noting that \"Lewis' soaring vocals add to the effect\" and that \"all these elements making yet another bonafide smash from the EDM hitmaker\". Writing for Dancing Astronaut, Farrell Sweeney noted the presence of \"an energy-building violin line and acoustic elements\" resulting from a song \"vocal-led by Lewis's impassioned vocals, while Garrix foregoes a heavy electronic emphasis, trading it in for a subtle production backdrop accented with acoustics\". Mike Wass of Idolator deemed the song \"an emotional banger\" and \"a duo's genre-blurring bop\", containing Dean Lewis vocals \"over piano keys and strummed guitar\". Writing for Your EDM, Matthew Meadow said that the track is \"usual Garrix fare, with some quaint vocal chops in the drop and a non-intrusive melody\". According to him, the singer voice \"never really stands out from the production, which itself never really reaches any sort of crescendo\". He also spotted similarities with Martin Garrix previous songs, such as \"No Sleep\" or \"There for You\", but noted that \"Used to Love\" showed off \"a more mellow side to his sound, rather than the firework-inducing main stage bangers most people know him for\". In an article written later he remarked that releasing the single on Halloween day was \"a bit of an odd choice for such an uplifting song as this\". Phil Scilippa of EDM.com noted that the song \"retains an optimistic vibe, while the lyrics themselves are quite nostalgic and sad\". He called the single \"a future bass inspired sound\" endowed with \"an uplifting vivacity\" thanks to \"Lewis' piano parts and vocals\" which \"are the cherry on top\" and giving to the song \"a bright and summery feeling\".\n\nMusic video \nThe official music video of the song was released at the same day through Martin Garrix's YouTube channel.

She lived in rural Rutland and would often explore the land around her, developing a deep love of flora and fauna, as well as an ability to find comfort and relief in nature. This connection with nature helped Stuart find peace when her older sister, who had acted as a surrogate mother for her, died. Stuart continued to develop and search for her relationship with God into her early adulthood, when she met Priest Fr. Galloway who became her spiritual mentor and friend. Stuart felt that the Catholic Church would give her the most freedom in her spirituality and converted in 1879. Due to the strong religious divide in England at the time, and being the daughter of the evangelical rector, this conversion cost Stuart her relationship with her family as she left the Church of England.\n\nCatholic vocation\n\nAt the age of 21,  Stuart converted to Roman Catholicism on 6 March 1879. In 1882, she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, where she would spend the next 30 years of her religious life. Stuart was named Mistress of Novices on 12 February 1889, which began her three decades of serving as secretary and associate of the Mother Superior. In 1894 she became Superior of the community in Roehampton, then Superior of Vicar of England. In this role, Stuart studied social injustice in her community, taught Sunday school, and advocated on behalf of poor tenant farmers. On 27 August 1911, she was elected as the sixth Superior General of the Society of the Sacred Heart. In this role, Stuart made it her mission to become personally acquainted with all the religious and visit every community affiliated with the Society in the world. Stuart proceeded to visit almost every RSCJ community around the world and travelled extensively throughout the United States and Latin America. She also visited convents from Europe to Egypt, Australia, Japan, Canada, and the United States. Stuart directed the Society’s administration from their main office in Ixelles, Brussels until 1914, when she had to return to Roehampton due to the German occupation of Brussels that began in August 1914. Janet Erskine Stuart died on 21 October 1914. Many Religious of the Sacred Heart, other congregations, and individuals have been inspired by her conferences, essays, and poetry.\n\nWritings\nHer writings included The Education of Catholic Girls (1912), The Society of the Sacred Heart (1914), and Highways and By-ways in the Spiritual Life. Stuart contributed also to the Catholic Encyclopedia.\n\nShe visited the Catholic girls' boarding school in Wellington, NZ, in 1914 and planted a tree. In the 1960s, the school was named Erskine College, after her.\n\nReferences\n\nLegacy\nDigby Stuart College, a constituent college of the University of Roehampton, England\nDoane Stuart School.

She is best known for her writings on education and spirituality, including The Education of Catholic Girls (1902) and Tragedy Squared (1914). Stuart was born on 25 April 1857 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the daughter of Mary and John Hope Erskine. The family moved to England in 1868, and Janet attended school in Eastbourne and London. In 1879, she entered the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, a religious community founded in 1846 by Cornelia Connelly. As a professed Religious, she adopted the name Mary Joseph. Stuart was an educator who taught at schools in England, Ireland, France, the United States and Canada. In 1884, she became headmistress of the Convent of Holy Child Jesus in Roehampton, London. She was later appointed as Provincial Superior of the Institute in England (1892-1895), France (1897-1902) and the United States (1902-1908). Stuart also wrote several books on education and spirituality, including The Education of Catholic Girls (1902), The Catholic Ideal in Education (1905), Tragedy Squared (1914), as well as booklets on prayer and spirituality. She is credited with introducing the Christian Brothers and the Society of the Sacred Heart to Canadian schools. Stuart's influence extended beyond Catholic education, as she was consulted by Pope Benedict XV on matters related to religious reform and the advancement of Christian spiritual ideals. She died on 26 February 1933 in San Diego, California. Today, Sister Stuart is remembered for her work in education and spirituality, as well as for her leadership within the Roman Catholic Church.

Where lacis adds decorative stitches to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative.\n\nThere is some archeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.\n\nIn contrast to Europe where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie and lacemaking was part of many or most women's lives.\n\nTechnique\nThe lace is made by tying knots, usually tied onto the previous round of the piece creating small loops of thread onto which the next round of knots can be tied. Patterns are created by varying the length of the loops, missing loops from the previous round, adding extra loops and similar.\n\nWhen used as an edging the lace can be made directly onto the hem of the fabric being edged. When a doily or freeform object (such as the birds and flowers decorating traditional headscarves) is being started a series of loops is tied onto a slip knot which is pulled tight to complete the first round.\n\nSee also\nList of fabric names\n\nReferences\n\nSpecific\n\nNeedle lace\nArmenian art\nArmenian culture\nTextile arts of Armenia", "machine_text": " Armenian needlelace is a type of fine needlework, also known as kshot or kshord, developed in Armenia in the 19th century. It is characterized by geometrically arranged white or off-white cotton threads worked into an intricate, symmetrical pattern of multiple layers. The process of making Armenian needlelace is much like that of other forms of needlework—needles and thread, not embroidery floss—but the outcome is a very distinctive, strong three-dimensional design. The basic element of the needlelace are the stitches which are made in a regular pattern to make up the ground or foundation of the design, typically with one layer of stitching having multiple layers of stitching added to it. The stitches used in Armenian needlelace include poke, round, and buttonhole, as well as 'satyn' (double running) and 'ojakheer.' It takes a great deal of skill and dedication to the craft to create a finished piece. The intricate patterns used in the craft of needlelacing make it unique and highly sought after. Patterns are repeated multiple times and even the most experienced craftsperson could not replicate a pattern by memory. Consequently, an Armenian needlelacer would traditionally document their work in a pattern book with written or drawn diagrams of the pattern. Armenian needlelace is highly valued and has a long history, tracing back to ancient times when it was used to embellish clothing and furnishings. It was used to decorate clothes and buildings, from churches to palaces, and the craftsman had to be highly skilled to achieve the intricate patterns. Armenian needlelace is a valued skill, not only for its beauty, but for its symbolism. During certain folklore traditions, young women gathered to sew together items of needlelace and would make toasts with the resulting piece. The toasts would serve to bless the young women and wish them success. The needlelace pieces were then blessed at church and hung in homes, believed to bring protection and health to the family. In modern times, Armenian needlelace is still a respected craft and continues to be used by skilled practitioners to decorate clothing, furnishings, even as a stand-alone piece. Its uniqueness and craftsmanship are what make it so special, and a testament to the generations of craftspeople who used the medium to create something that stands the test of time.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1975614}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Projective line\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, a projective line is, roughly speaking, the extension of a usual line by a point called a point at infinity. The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no \"parallel\" case).\n\nThere are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field K, commonly denoted P1(K), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional K-vector space. This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space.\n\nThe projective line over the reals is a manifold; see real projective line for details.\n\nHomogeneous coordinates\nAn arbitrary point in the projective line P1(K) may be represented by an equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates, which take the form of a pair\n\nof elements of K that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor λ:\n\nLine extended by a point at infinity \nThe projective line may be identified with the line K extended by a point at infinity. More precisely,\nthe line K may be identified with the subset of P1(K) given by\n\nThis subset covers all points in P1(K) except one, which is called the point at infinity:\n\nThis allows to extend the arithmetic on K to P1(K) by the formulas\n\nTranslating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when  does not occur:\n\nExamples\n\nReal projective line\n\nThe projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line.  It may also be thought of as the line K together with an idealised point at infinity ∞ ; the point connects to both ends of K creating a closed loop or topological circle. \n\nAn example is obtained by projecting points in R2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup \n\nCompare the extended real number line, which distinguishes ∞ and −∞.\n\nComplex projective line: the Riemann sphere\nAdding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere. Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the Gauss sphere). It is in constant use in complex analysis, algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface.\n\nFor a finite field\n\nThe projective line over a finite field Fq of q elements has  points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates , q of these points have the form:\n for each  in ,\n\nand the remaining point at infinity may be represented as [1 : 0].\n\nSymmetry group\nQuite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in K acts on the projective line P1(K). This group action is transitive, so that P1(K) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL2(K) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations. Transitivity says that there exists a homography that will transform any point Q to any other point R. The point at infinity on P1(K) is therefore an artifact of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates\n\nexpress a one-dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point  lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point  to any other, and it is in no way distinguished.\n\nMuch more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points Qi for  to any other 3-tuple Ri of distinct points (triple transitivity). This amount of specification 'uses up' the three dimensions of PGL2(K); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive. The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio. Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL2(K) action on a projective line, replacing \"field\" by \"KT-field\" (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and \"PGL\" by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.\n\nAs algebraic curve\nThe projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve. From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P1(K) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If K is algebraically closed, it is the unique such curve over K, up to rational equivalence. In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over K to a conic C, which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if C has a point defined over K; geometrically such a point P can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence..\n\nThe function field of the projective line is the field K(T) of rational functions over K, in a single indeterminate T. The field automorphisms of K(T) over K are precisely  the group PGL2(K) discussed above. \n\nAny function field K(V) of an algebraic variety V over K, other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with K(T). From the point of view of birational geometry, this means that there will be a rational map from V to P1(K), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P1(K), and the inverse image of a typical point P will be of dimension . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis, and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide.\n\nIf V is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve C presented 'over' P1(K). Assuming C is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with K(C)), it can be shown that such a rational map from C to P1(K) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a double point where a curve crosses itself may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification. \n\nMany curves, for example hyperelliptic curves, may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, the genus then depends only on the type of ramification.\n\nA rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space Pn is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence), given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as\n\n[1 : t : t2 : ... : tn].\n\nSee twisted cubic for the first interesting case.\n\nSee also\n\n Projectively extended real line\n Cross-ratio\n Projective range\n Möbius transformations\n Algebraic curve\n Projective line over a ring\n\nReferences\n\nAlgebraic curves\nProjective geometry", "machine_text": " The projective line, denoted P^1, is the smallest projective structure, the simplest example of a projective space, and the basic example of a geometric manifold. The projective line is a one-dimensional space, consisting of two distinct points, and comes equipped with a topology, whose basic open sets are the two points, and their complements. It is a special case of an algebraic variety, and is a construction within projective geometry. Projective geometries are those that involve complex numbers and Euclidean transformations. A projective line is a structure that allows us to make new Euclidean objects by taking lines and points and transforming them in a certain way. The projective line, denoted P^1, is the basic example of this, and is a one-dimensional space with two distinct points. Projective geometry is important in its own right, and it provides a useful tool to study other geometries. In particular, projective geometry is useful in studying non-Euclidean geometries, where certain Euclidean properties no longer hold. For example, the properties of projective lines allow us to further consider n-dimensional spaces. In algebraic terms, the projective line is defined as the one-dimensional variety in P^2. A projective line can be described in terms of a set of homogeneous coordinates. It is impossible to provide an explicit description of P^1 in this way, but there are analytic descriptions available. In projective geometry, a projective line also serves as a base for the construction of projective spaces of higher dimensions. It is possible to define a projective plane, for example, as the space of lines through the origin in P^3. In topology, the projective line is an example of the topological structure known as a Mobius strip. This structure is formed by a continuous interaction between two distinct points, and is often used to study various topological properties. In mathematics, there are various uses of projective lines. In category theory, they can be used to study different categories and their relationship with each other. In algebraic number theory, projective lines are used to describe the field of algebraic numbers. They are also used in constructing various algebraic objects, including bundles of Euler projective lines. In physics, projective lines are used to describe various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of a particle of light in space. They can also be used to describe the behavior of matter subject to gravitational forces, in which the field lines are described by projective lines. Projective lines are an important part of mathematics, and their studies provide insight into the underlying structure of many concepts. They are also a useful tool for studying various physical phenomena.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nimbarka Sampradaya\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Nimbarka Sampradaya (IAST: Nimbārka Sampradāya, Sanskrit निम्बार्क सम्प्रदाय), also known as the Hamsa Sampradāya, and Sanakādi Sampradāya (सनकादि सम्प्रदाय), is one of the four  Sampradāyas. It was founded by Nimbarka, a Telugu Brahmin yogi and philosopher. It propounds the Vaishnava Bhedabheda theology of Dvaitadvaita (dvaita-advaita) or dualistic non-dualism. Dvaitadvaita states that humans are both different and non-different from Isvara, God or Supreme Being. Specifically, this Sampradaya is a part of Krishnaism—Krishna-centric traditions.\n\nGuru Parampara\n\nNimbarka Sampradaya is also known as Kumāra Sampradāya, Hamsa Sampradāya, and Sanakādi Sampradāya. According to tradition, the Nimbarka Sampradaya Dvaita-advaita philosophy was revealed by  to Sri Sanakadi Bhagawan, one of the Four Kumaras; who passed it to Sri Narada Muni; and then on to Nimbarka. The Four Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana, and Sanat Kumāra, are traditionally regarded as the four mind-born sons of Lord Brahmā. They were created by Brahmā in order to advance creation, but chose to undertake lifelong vows of celibacy (brahmacarya), becoming renowned yogis, who requested from Brahma the boon of remaining perpetually five years old. Śrī Sanat Kumāra Samhitā, a treatise on the worship of , is attributed to the brothers, just like the Śrī Sanat Kumāra Tantra, which is part of the Pancarātra literature.\n\nIn the creation of this universe as narrated by the  literature, Śrī Nārada Muni is the younger brother of the Four Kumāras, who took initiation from his older brothers. Their discussions as guru and disciple are recorded in the  with a famous conversation in the , and in the Śrī Nārada  and the Pañcarātra literature.\n\nNārada Muni is recorded as main teacher in all four of the  Sampradāyas. According to tradition, he initiated Śrī Nimbārkācārya into the sacred 18-syllabled Śrī Gopāla Mantra (Klim Krishnaya Govindaya Gopijanavallabhaya Svaha), and introduced him to the philosophy of the Yugala upāsana, the devotional worship of the divine couple . According to tradition, this was the first time that Śrī Rādhā  were worshipped together by anyone on earth other than the Gopis of . Śrī Nārada Muni then taught Nimbarka the essence of devotional service in the Śrī Nārada Bhakti Sūtras. Śrī Nimbārkācārya already knew the Vedas,  and the rest of the scriptures, but perfection was found in the teachings of Śrī Nārada Muni.\n\nNimbarka\n\nDating\nNimbarka is conventionally dated at the 12th or 13th century, but this dating has been questioned, suggesting that Nimbarka lived somewhat earlier than Shankara, in the 6th or 7th century CE.\n\nAccording to Roma Bose, Nimbarka lived in the 13th century, on the presupposition that Śrī Nimbārkāchārya was the author of the work Madhvamukhamardana. Bhandarkar has placed him after Ramanuja, suggesting 1162 AD as the date of his demise. S.N.Dasgupta dated Nimbarka to around middle of 14th century, while S. A. A. Rizvi assigns a date of c.1130–1200 AD.\n\nAccording to Satyanand, Bose's dating of the 13th century is an erroneous attribution. Malkovsky, following Satyanand, notes that in Bhandarkar's own work it is clearly stated that his dating of Nimbarka was an approximation based on an extremely flimsy calculation; yet most scholars chose to honour his suggested date, even until modern times. According to Malkovsky, Satyanand has convincingly demonstrated that Nimbarka and his immediate disciple Shrinivasa flourished well before Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE), arguing that Shrinivasa was a contemporary, or just after Sankaracarya (early 8th century). According to Ramnarace, summarising the available research, Nimbarka must be dated in the 7th century CE.\n\nTraditional accounts\nAccording to the Bhavishya Purana, and his eponymous tradition, the Nimbārka Sampradāya, Śrī Nimbārkāchārya appeared in the year 3096 BCE, when the grandson of Arjuna was on the throne. According to tradition, Nimbārka was born in Vaidūryapattanam, the present-day Mungi Village, Paithan in East Maharashtra. His parents were Aruṇa Ṛṣi and Jayantī Devī. Together, they migrated to Mathurā and settled at what is now known as Nimbagrāma (Neemgaon), situated between Barsānā and Govardhan.\n\nSri Hansa Bhagwan \nIn Hinduism, the first guru of the Nimbarka Sampradaya is Lord Sri Hansa Bhagwan, who himself is one of the twenty-four incarnations of Lord Vishnu. At the beginning of creation, in the Satya Yuga, Lord Vishnu Himself took the form of a quadrangle, joined conch shells, chakras, maces, and lotuses, and descended to the sage Sankadi, the son of Brahma, in the name of Hansabata.\n\nTeachings\n\nDvaita-advaita\nThe Nimbarka Sampradaya is based on Nimbarka's Bhedabheda philosophy, duality and nonduality at the same time, or dualistic non-dualism.\n\nAccording to Nimbarka, there are three categories of existence, namely Isvara (God, Divine Being); cit (jiva, the individual soul); and acit (lifeless matter). Cit and acit are different from Isvara, in the sense that they have attributes (Guna) and capacities (Swabhaava), which are different from those of Isvara. At the same time, cit and acit are not different from Isvara, because they cannot exist independently of him. Isvara is independent and exists by himself, while cit and acit exist in dependence upon him. Difference means a kind of existence which is separate but dependent, (para-tantra-satta-bhava); while non-difference means impossibility of separate existence (svatantra-satta-bhava).\n\nAccording to Nimbarka, the relation between Brahman, on the one hand, and the souls (cit) and universe (acit) on the other, is a relation of natural difference-non-difference (svabhavika-bhedabheda). Nimbarka equally emphasises both difference and non-difference, as against Ramanuja, who makes difference subordinate to non-difference, in as much as, for him cit and acit do not exist separately from Brahman, but are its body or attributes.\n\nNimbarka accepts parinamavada, the idea that the world is a real transformation (parinama) of Brahman, to explain the cause of animate and inanimate world, which he says exist in a subtle form in the various capacities (saktis), which belong to Brahman in its natural condition. Brahman is the material cause of the universe, in the sense that Brahman brings the subtle rudiments into the gross form, by manifesting these capacities.\n\nFor Nimbarka the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopi's, or cowherdesses, of the celestial Vrindavan. Devotion, according to Nimbarka, consists in prapatti, or self-surrender.\n\nSri Nimbarkacharya, on the  worship of the divine couple, in\nDasha Shloki (verse 6):\n\nCit (Jiva)\nThe cit or individual soul is of the nature of knowledge (jnana-svarupa); it is able to know without the help of the sense-organs and it is in this sense that words like prajnana-ghanah svayamjyotih jnanamayah etc. as applied to jiva are to be understood. The jiva is the knower also; and he can be both knowledge and the possessor of knowledge at the same time, just as the sun is both light and the source of light. Thus the soul, who is knowledge, and his attribute, knowledge, though they are both identical as knowledge, can be at the same time different and related as the qualified () and the quality (), just as the sun and his light, though identical as light (taijasa), are still different from each other. Thus there is both a difference and a non-difference between the  and ; and the extreme similarity between them implies, not necessarily their absolute identity, but only a non-perception of their difference.\n\nThe jiva is also ego (ahamarthah). This ego continues to persist not only in the state of deep sleep, (because our consciousness immediately after getting up from sleep has the form slept happily or knew nothing) but also in the state of liberation. It even belongs to the Parabrahman. Hence it is that Krishna refers to Himself so frequently in the first person in the Gita, of which the chief object is thus Purusottama, who is omniscient and at the same time non-different from the ego or asmadartha.\n\nThe jiva is also essentially active (kartr). This quality belongs to it in all its conditions, even after release. But the kartrtva is not independent. The jiva is also enjoyer (bhoktr) essentially in all its conditions.\n\nFor his knowledge and activity, however, the jiva depends on Hari; thus, though resembling Him in being intelligent and knower, he is at the same time distinguished from him by his dependence. This quality of dependence or of being controlled (niyamyatva) is the very nature of jiva even in the state of release, just as niyamyatva or the quality of being the controller, forms the eternal nature of Isvara.\n\nThe jiva is atomic in size; at the same time his attribute, knowledge, is omnipresent, which makes it possible that he can experience pleasure and pain in any part of the body, just as, for instance, the light of a lamp can spread far and wide and illumine objects away from the lamp. The Jivas are different and in different bodies, and so are infinite in number.\n\nAcit (the jagat)\nThe acit is of three different kinds: viz. prakrta, aprakrta, and kala. Prakrta, or what is derived from Prakrti, the primal matter, aprakrta is defined negatively as that which is not the product of prakrti, but its real nature is not clearly brought out. These three categories in their subtle forms are as eternal as the cit or the individual souls.\n\n[Nimbarka does not explain what exactly the aprakrta is, nor does he define kala more precisely, beyond noticing, as pointed out above, that the aprakrta and the kala are species of the acit. But, Purusottamacarya of the Nimbarka school has, in his Vedantaratna-manjusa, described acit aprakrta as the material cause of the dhama (celestial abode) of Brahman and the bodies and ornaments etc.of Brahman and his associates.]\n\nPrakrti, or the primal matter-the stuff of the entire universe is real and eternal like the individual souls, and like them, though eternal and unborn, has yet Brahman for its cause. It consists of the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, such as prakrit, mahat, ahankara etc. (just similar to 24 principles of the Sankhyas).\n\nPractices - the five sadhanas\nThe basic practice consists of the worship of Sri Radha Madhav, with Sri Radha being personified as the inseparable part of Sri Krishna. Nimbarka Sampradaya became the first Krishnaite tradition in late medieval time. Nimbarka refers to five methods to salvation, namely karma (ritual action); vidya (knowledge); upasana or dhyana (meditation); prapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion); Gurupasatti (devotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna).\n\nKarma (ritual action)\nPerformed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one's varna and asrama (phase of life) thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation).\n\nVidya (knowledge)\n\nNot as a subordinate factor of karma but also not as an independent means for everyone; only for those inclined to spending vast lengths of time in scriptural study and reflection on deeper meanings.\n\nUpasana or dhyana (meditation)\nIt is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, i.e. meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the sentient. Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non-sentient. Final one is meditation on Lord Himself, as different from the sentient and non-sentient. This is again not an independent means to Salvation for all, as only those qualified to perform the upasana (with Yajnopavitam) can perform this Sadhana.\n\nPrapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion)\nDevotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna. This method of attaining Salvation, known as Prapatti Sadhana, contains elements of all the other means, and is most importantly, available to all. Men, women, foreigners, all classes and castes (or non-castes) are permitted to seek liberation through this, the most important Sadhana. It is referred to as Sadhana (or Apara) Bhakti – devotion through regulations. This in turn leads to Para Bhakti – the highest devotion characterised by Madhurya Rasa – the sweet emotions of devotion experienced by those perfected in Sadhana Bhakti.\n\nThe Maha-mantra Radhe Krishna of Nimbarka Sampradaya is as follows:\n\nGurupasatti\nDevotion and self-surrender to guru. Best realised as a part in Prapatti, and not as an independent means, although it can be so.\n\nSri Nimbarka made the \"Bhasya\"  (commentary in which alle the words of the verses are used, in contradistinction to a tika, which is a more free commentary) of the Brahmasutra on his Dvaitadvaita Vedanta (Principle of Dualism-Nondualism) in his famous book \"Vedanta Parijata Sourabha\".\n\nLiterature\nSri Nimbarkacharya wrote the following books:\n Vedanta Parijat Saurabh– Commentary on the Brahma Sutras\n Sadachar Prakasha– a treatise on karma kanda\n Commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita\n Rahasya Shodasi- Sri Gopala Mantra explained\n Prapanna Kalpa Valli-Sri Mukunda Mantra explained\n Prapatti Chintamani–  On Supreme surrender\n Pratah Smarana Stotram\n Dasa Shloki or Kama Dhenu– Ten Verses\n Savisesh Nirvisesh\n Sri Krishna Stavam\n\nNimbarka Sampradaya Devacāryas\n\nSri Bhatta\n\nAs themes of Radha and Krishna gained popularity, Keshava Kashmiri's disciple Sribhatta in the 15th century, amplified Nimbarka's insights and brought Radha Krishna once more into the theological forefront through the medium of brajbhasha. A range of poets and theologians who flourished in the milieu of Vrindavana, Vallabha, Surdas, rest of Vallabha's disciples, Svami Haridas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Six Goswamis of Vrindavana were influenced in some manner by Sribhatta. The theological insights by this particular teacher were developed by his disciple Harivyasa, whose works reveal not only the theology of Radha Krisna and the sakhis the nitya nikunja lilas of goloka vrindavana, but also embody a fairly developed vedantic theory propagating the unique branch of bedhaabedha philosophy, ultimately the legacy of Nimbarka's original re-envisaging role of Radha.\n\nSvāmī Harivyāsa Devacārya (c.1470-1540 CE)\nSvāmī Harivyāsa Devacārya (c.1470-1540 CE), the 35th leader, reformed the tradition. He was given the śālagrāma deity known as Śrī Sarveśvara that was handed down through time it is believed from Nimbārka himself. He anointed twelve of his senior disciples to lead missions throughout the land. The most famous are Svāmī Paraśurāma Devācārya (c.1525-1610 CE) and Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl. 16th century).\n\nSvāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl.16th century CE)\nSvāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl.16th century CE) was born in Budhiya Village, outside Jagadhri and Yamunanagar near Kurukshetra in modern Haryana, India. He established over 52 temples in Punjab, Haryana and Vraja during his lifetime; his current followers are found mostly in , Haryana, Punjab, Bengal, Rajasthan, Orissa, Assam, Sikkim, Bihar, other regions in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, also in significant numbers in Nepal.\n\nIn his sub-lineage, there are many branches. Notable saints of this sub-branch include:\n Saint Swami Chatur Chintamani Nagaji Maharaj, who started the Vraja Parikrama. This tradition has been continuously maintained over 528 years by the Acharyas of the Svabhurāma-Dwara (sub-lineage).\n\nRamdas Kathiababa  (fl.54th century CE)\nThat saint was the 53rd Acharya of our community, Sri Sri 108 Swami Devdasji Kathia Babaji Maharaj. Sri Sri Devdasji Maharaj was a great man of Yogishwar Siddha. He was buried in Ekasan for six months and had nothing to eat even though he was not in the grave. After taking sannyasa, Kathia's father was named \"Ramdas\". From the time of Guru's presence, he was fully engaged in Guruseva. His guru started teaching him astanga yoga, all kinds of mantras and their application method with Hatha Yoga. Gurudev, however, did not make the mistake of testing the disciple from time to time. Sometimes he would starve, sometimes he would have a very tasty meal, sometimes he would test Sri Sri Ramdasji with inaudible abuse or beatings for no reason. Once Sri Sri Devdasji showed him a seat and asked him to sit there, instructing him, \"You will sit here in this seat until I come back. Don't leave your seat and go anywhere else. \" Gurudev came eight days later. Sri Ramdasji sat in that seat for eight consecutive days, did not eat anything, nor did he defecate. When Gurudev returned on the eighth day, Sri Ramdasji got up from his seat and prostrated himself before Gurudev. Seeing this devotion and determination towards obeying his guru, Gurudev was very pleased and said, \"In this way one has to obey the guru's orders. God is pleased when the Guru's orders are obeyed wholeheartedly. \"came to Vrindavan and made his first monastery there. He was succeeded by Swami Santadas Kathiababa\n\nSantadas Kathiababa (fl.55th century CE)\nSantadas Kathiababa was a Nimbarka philosopher, Hindu religious guru, Nimbarka Vaishnava and chief mahanta, a spiritual leader and a leading disciple of Sri Sri 108 Ramdas Kathiababa of the Nimbarka Sampradaya.\nAt the place of Jagannath Ghat, Gangotri, the source of the Ganges, floated in front of him and Har-Parvati, who was present in it, visited himLord Shankara then gave him a monosyllabic seed mantra and by chanting that mantra he would gain Sadguru - with such an assurance they disappeared. Then the scene of that Gomukh Gangotri in the Himalayas also disappeared. He started chanting that seed mantra with great devotion. In search of a good guru, he went on various pilgrimages and gradually he arrived at the Prayag Kumbh Mela with a friend. Although his interview here was with his future Gurudev Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj, he was skeptical about whether he would take him seriously. He saw some miracles of Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj[4] but could not be completely without doubt. .Then he went to Vrindavan in the month of Chaitra and this time he was almost disappointed to see his work from very close to Kathia Babaji Maharaj. Far from considering Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj as a Brahmajna Mahapurusha, Sri Tarakishore Babu considered him to be an ordinary old village saint. But when his miraculous deeds came to mind, he could not understand exactly what was wrong with his decision. With this skeptical mind he returned to Calcutta. One night in Calcutta, when he was sleeping on the roof of his house, he suddenly woke up and sat up. He saw Sri Sri Ramdas Kathia Babaji Maharaj coming towards Akash Marg and in a short time he came down to him on that roof. After that, Kathia Babaji Maharaj gave a mantra in his ear and left again. There was no other doubt in the mind of Sri Tara Kishore Sharma Chowdhury about Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj. All his hesitations were immediately dispelled and he considered himself fortunate to have taken refuge in the desired Sadguru. Even after being miraculously initiated in this way, he formally took wife's initiation in Vrindavan on the day of Janmashtami in 1894.\n Swami Brindaban Bihari Das Mahanta Maharaj at Kathia Baba ka Ashram, Shivala, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh and Sukhchar, 24-Parganas (North), West Bengal, who has undertaken projects for orphans and aged persons, building schools and elderly care homes.

It was founded in the 12th century by Shri Nimbarkacharya, and is followed mainly by the Saint Rudra followers of Vaishnavism, although members of other Hindu schools sometimes follow this Sampradaya as well. Nimbarka Sampradaya is a unique Vaishnava tradition in that it combines both the teachings of the Sri Bhagavata and the Ahimsa philosophies of Jainism. Shri Niimbarkacharya was born in a village called Ekand in the Mathura region of Northern India. According to tradition, Nimbarka was the son of a brahmin and a kshatriya and was born in the month of Chaitra, sometime between 1110-1120 AD. Nimbarka's teachings propounded the philosophy known as ‘Dwaitadvaita’, a Vaishnava interpretation of the Brahman and Paramatma relationship. This system of thought defines Brahman as the creator, preserver, and destroyer and Paramatma, or God, as the protector, sustainer, and master of the universe. Nimbarka rejected the standard concepts of polytheism and monotheism, instead proposing that Brahman and Paramatma coexist in all matter and in all forms. The Nimbarka Sampradaya is made up of several sub-sects, including Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Vishnuswami, Swaminarayana, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabha and Madhava. Each of these sub-sects has its own specialisations and understanding of the concept of God and His relationship to the universe. This allows the members of this Sampradaya to come together and explore various aspects of devotion to the Absolute Being. Nimbarka Sampradaya is known for its emphasis on scriptural study, meditation, devotion and service to the Absolute Being. Members of this Sampradaya follow a strict spiritual practice which includes offering services to the Lord, chanting prayers, engaging in japa, and performing special worship rituals. Since the primary goal of this Sampradaya is to unite with the Supreme Being, a great deal of focus is placed on developing a personal relationship with the Lord through spiritual activities such as meditation, contemplation and service. The main focus of the Nimbarka Sampradaya is the practice of Sri Bhagavata Dharma, or devotion to the Supreme Being. This includes the worship of Vishnu, the practice of bhakti yoga, or the yoga of love and devotion to the Lord, the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord, the offering of prayers and prostrations to the Lord, and proper adoration and service to him. Other aspects of this Sampradaya include the study of the Vedas and the Upanishads, the recitation of mantras, and regular visits to temples of Lord Vishnu to offer prayers. Nimbarka Sampradaya is a vibrant world-wide community, with strong traditions and followers throughout India and around the world. This tradition has passed down through generations and continues to be a source of inspiration for all its adherents. Its emphasis on the Inner Being and its unique principles make this one of the most popular and powerful Vaishnava schools of thought.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11310737}

This was the first local election to be held since the re-introduction of the single transferable voting system in 2010. The 2013 elections were contested by 59 district health boards (DHBs), 19 city councils and one regional council. All DHBs, councils and the regional council had elections for the mayor, for ward councillors where applicable, and for community board members in the respective areas. The elections saw a steady decrease in voter turnout from the previous 2007 elections and the lowest turnout since 2002, with a total of 50.52%. Fewer women voted than men at every level; only one incumbent mayor was taken out of office, Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown. The overall trend of the 2013 elections was a swing to the centre and far right, with the taxpayer and advocacy group Right-Wing achieving an unprecedented level of success, winning a third of all mayoral elections and a majority in five of the major metropolitan areas. The success of Right-Wing saw increased scrutiny over local policies. In Auckland, the issue of transport policies, port shareholdings and rates increases drove the campaigns. The Auckland Council represented by Len Brown also took a hardline stance against Right-Wing victories in the form of a referendum on reducing Council/Governing Body representation from 20 to 16 members. In the Christchurch City Council, the incumbent mayor Bob Parker was returned for a fourth term. Mayor Parker, whose approval rating has been steadily increasing since the 2010/11 earthquakes, saw the mayoral race become a referendum on the city's response to the earthquakes and the rebuild project, with continuity representing a focal point for his successful campaign. The 2013 New Zealand local elections saw a significant drop in voter participation, attributed to apathy towards local politics and incumbents. The results, however, showed a distinct swing to the centre and right-wing, a move that is expected to continue over the coming years given the overall trend of local politics.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31299994}

Albert was born in 1865 in Pennsylvania. He received his early education in his native state and from an early age, he demonstrated an aptitude for business. At the age of sixteen, he began working as an apprentice in a small rubber factory, which eventually gave him the experience needed to start his own rubber manufacturing business. By 1888, Albert had established the Burditt Corporation, which specialized in the production of rubber products for government and commercial clients. At first, Burditt's Corporation focused mostly on the production of rubber balls and rubber tires, and this was an integral part of their success. By 1912, Burditt had extended their business to include the manufacture of piping, springs, gaskets, and similar rubber parts. Not only did the company become an important part of the industrial sector in the United States, but it made a great contribution to the war effort in World War I. In addition to the production of rubber and related parts, Burditt also began to provide consulting services to government clients. By then, Burditt had become one of the country's most respected firms in its field. Albert Burditt was a hands-on operator who ran the Burditt business until his death in 1940. He ran a tight ship and insisted on only the very highest standards in production and service. He was dogged in adherence to his principles and often clashed with governmental and other agencies, but he always stayed focused on the production and delivery of quality products. In 1956, Burditt Corporation was acquired by a larger industrial conglomerate, but the company still exists as a shadow of its former self. Nonetheless, Albert Burditt's legacy lives on in the contributions Burditt Corporation made during his tenure as the founder and first CEO. He was a true pioneer in the American industrial sector and a driving force during the early years of growth of the rubber industry. He set a high bar for quality and standards, and these remain hallmarks of the Burditt Corporation today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16992651}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Open wagon\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Open wagons (trucks in the UK) form a large group of railway goods wagons designed primarily for the transportation of bulk goods that are not moisture-retentive and can usually be tipped, dumped or shovelled. The International Union of Railways (UIC) distinguishes between ordinary wagons (Class E/UIC-type 5) and special wagons (F/6). Open wagons often form a significant part of a railway company's goods wagon fleet; for example, forming just under 40% of the Deutsche Bahn's total goods wagon stock in Germany.\n\nUIC standard goods wagons\nSince the 1960s, the majority of goods wagons procured by European railway administrations have been built to standards laid down by, or based on, those established by the UIC. In addition to open wagons the table also shows wagons with opening roofs (Class T), whose design is based on open wagons.\n\nClass E – Ordinary open high-sided wagons\n\nThese wagons have a level floor and solid sides with at least one door on each side. They are mainly used for transporting bulk goods, coal, scrap, steel, wood and paper. The majority of wagons have folding sides and end walls, otherwise they are given the letters l (fixed sides) or o (fixed end walls). Wagons may have one or two folding end walls. \nSteel rings enable ropes, nets or covers to be attached to secure the load.\n\nSome of these wagons can also be completely tipped over, in other words, at certain places they can be lifted up and emptied by being turned about their longitudinal axis. This requires a very robust underframe. Sometimes the wagons are fitted with rotatable couplings so that they do not have to be individually uncoupled.\n\nIn 1998 the DB had about 16,000 four-axle Class E wagons. They have increasingly retired their twin-axled E wagons since the 1990s and they are now rarely seen.\n\nClass F – Special open high-sided wagons\nThe majority of these are self-discharging wagons which use gravity-unloading (hopper cars and saddle-bottomed wagons), but in addition there are also:\n Side-tipping wagons (box tip, trough-tip or side-tip wagon),\n Bucket wagon, other open wagons without side doors\n\nIn 1998, the Deutsche Bahn had about 12,000 hopper wagons, 10,000 saddle-bottomed wagons and 1,000 side-tipping wagons. In addition to hopper and saddle-bottomed wagons there were also wagons with opening roofs.\n\nTypical loads for these wagons are all sorts of bulk goods, like coal, coke, ore, sand or gravel. Because bulk goods are often moved in large quantities, these wagons are frequently used in so-called unit or block trains that only comprise one type of wagon and only shift one type of product from the dispatcher to the recipient.\n\nHopper wagons\n   \n\nHopper wagons can only be unloaded by gravity with no external assistance and are therefore also classed as self-discharging wagons. The majority may be filled, when at rail or road level, by high-level discharge chutes (whose ends are more than 70 cm above the top of the rails) or conveyor belts. Because a controlled amount of the load can be discharged at any place the wagons may be sent anywhere and are even used individually. Railway companies also use hoppers as departmental wagons in maintenance of way trains for ballasting the track.\n\nSince the 1990s there has been a trend for new hopper wagons to be built as bogie wagons which have not yet been standardised by the UIC.\n\nGallery\n\nSaddle-bottomed wagons\n\nSaddle-bottomed wagons are large-volume hoppers are exclusively unloaded by gravity and are therefore classed as self-discharging hoppers. Unlike normal hopper wagons, however, their discharge cannot be controlled and the entire load must be dropped. To unload the flaps on the side swing out allowing the load to empty. This is aided by the floor which slopes downwards on both sides like a gable roof. The discharging chutes on either side are relatively high up. These wagons are frequently seen in unit trains for transporting bulk goods such as coal or mineral ore from mines or ports to steelworks or power stations.\n\nThe most modern type of four axle saddle-bottomed wagon in the DB is the four axle Falns 121 with a loading volume of . It was built from 1992 in several batches. By February 2008 another 100 of these wagons were to have been delivered to the DB and another 300 by 2010. These latest wagons will have an axle load of  and an unladen weight of no more than , resulting in a load limit of .\n\nSide-tipping wagons\nSide-tipping wagons have hydraulic, pneumatic or electric tipping equipment, that enables the wagon body to be lifted on one side. Depending on the design, they may be tipped to both sides or just one side only. In order to prevent wagons from falling over during the tipping operation, some are equipped with track pinch bars with which they can be securely anchored to the trackbed. These wagons are often seen in unit trains being used to remove excavated material from major construction sites.\n\nSpecialized wagons\n\nLorry or mine car\n\nA lorry or mine car is an open railroad car (gondola) with a tipping trough, used in mining.  It is known in the UK as a tippler or chaldron wagon, and in the US as a mine car.\n\nChaldrons\n\nThe first railway bulk-cargo gondolas, the first freight wagons, were the chaldron cars of the early coal-carrying plateways.  These were relatively short in length and tall in proportion, with a tapered body that widened upwards, above the wheels.  Once locomotive haulage began, the unstable and top-heavy nature of this design became a problem with increasing speeds and later wagons became lower and longer.  The chaldron shape survived in a few cases, such as low-speed working around a large factory sites including steelworks.\n\nModalohr road trailer carriers\n\nModalohrs are specialized wagons for carrying road trailers and road tractors on the AFF route from France to Italy and Luxembourg to Spain and vice versa; there are plans to expand this service. A deck between the bogies (trucks) pivots (swings) 30°, allowing the trailers to be loaded from the sides. The cars are built by Lohr Industrie.\n\nIntermodal open wagons\n\nSee also\n\n Austauschbauart\n Class U special wagon\n German railway wagon classes\n German state railway norms\n Kangourou wagon\n Kriegsbauart\n Lowmac\n Pocket wagon\n Quarry tub\n Slate waggon\n Verbandsbauart\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Class Ua side-tippers in the Czech archives at parostroj.net\n DB goods wagon catalogue\n Flexiwaggon\n\nFreight rolling stock\nInternational Union of Railways", "machine_text": " An open wagon, also known as an open wagon car, is a type of train carriage designed for the transport of goods and other articles. It is typically used in freight, industrial, mining, and forestry railways. It is characterized by its open sides, which allow loading and unloading with a minimum of physical effort. The open wagon has been around since the early days of rail freight transport. It is the oldest and simplest type of train wagon. The sides and roof are made of wooden frames covered with sheet metal, and the floor is made of wooden boards. It is usually pulled by one or two locomotives. The design and specifications of open wagons vary greatly depending on the purpose for which they are used. For instance, heavy-duty open wagons are typically used for the transportation of coal, while lighter ones are used for the transportation of grain. Some open wagons are even fitted with additional compartments or covers for the safe transport of goods in bad weather. Open wagons are also used in some passenger transportation services, particularly in more rural areas. The most common type is the \"self-contained\" open wagon, where the carriage has all the necessary equipment and safety features to be self-sufficient. They are often used in countryside or tourist services. The open wagon is still a popular type of train wagon due to its relatively low cost and simplicity when compared to other types. It is also more easily maneuverable than other wagons and can be used in more constricted spaces thanks to its open sides. However, its open design makes it vulnerable to theft and vandalism. As a result, metal doors, locks and other security measures are often installed on open wagons. Despite these dangers, the open wagon continues to be an important element of both freight and passenger train services. It has seen many advances over the years, but remains one of the most basic and adaptable types of train wagon.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18961310}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"A Fable for Critics\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Fable for Critics is a book-length satirical poem by American writer James Russell Lowell, first published anonymously in 1848. The poem made fun of well-known poets and critics of the time and brought notoriety to its author.\n\nOverview\nA Fable for Critics satirized many of the most important figures in American literature at the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and James Fenimore Cooper. Many of his harshest judgments were aimed at names that have not survived in posterity, including Nathaniel Parker Willis, Cornelius Mathews, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and John Neal. He gave ample praise to Charles Frederick Briggs and Lydia Maria Child, though he was friends with both and likely allowed his friendship to inflate his assessment of their talents. Of Edgar Allan Poe, he said he was \"three-fifths genius... and two-fifths sheer fudge\". Lowell included himself as well, referring to himself as having difficulty determining the difference \"'twixt singing and preaching\". Many of the poetic portraits were balanced with praise, as in Halleck's:\nHalleck's better, I doubt not, than all he has written;\nIn his verse a clear glimpse you will frequently find\nIf not of a great, of a fortunate mind\n\nLowell's most vicious treatment was aimed at Margaret Fuller, whom he referred to as Miranda. At first, he intended to exclude her entirely but thought doing so would be more insulting and was convinced to write \"a line or two\" by his wife Maria White Lowell. Ultimately, his characterization was the only which was wholly negative and not balanced with praise. He suggested that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own and that she was only genuine when being spiteful.\n\nPublication history\n\nA Fable for Critics, with the subtitle \"A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies\", was published anonymously as a pamphlet early in 1848. Three thousand copies were sold in short order. Lowell had hoped there would be sufficient profit from his sales, which he intended to turn over to his financially struggling friend Briggs, though it was said the profit was only enough to purchase one small silver plate. The poem was reprinted several times with Lowell's name after its initial publication. One version included an introductory note explaining its author's intentions: \"This jeu d'esprit was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication\" until convinced to do so by Briggs.\n\nCritical response\nUltimately, A Fable for Critics earned Lowell notoriety as a poet, once his name was revealed, though he did not significantly profit from its publication. Lowell's early biographer Horace Scudder said A Fable for Critics was quickly overshadowed by the publication of The Biglow Papers, another satire by Lowell featuring a folksy character named Hosea Biglow which was published almost immediately following A Fable for Critics. Charles Briggs predicted as much in a letter to Lowell in which he said, \"I am pretty confident that the 'Fable' will suit the market for which it is intended, unless it should be killed by Hosea, who will help to divert public attention from his own kind\".\n\nJohn Ruskin labeled the poem \"in animal spirit and power... almost beyond anything I know\". Oliver Wendell Holmes found it \"capital—crammed full and rammed down hard—with powder (lots of it)—shot—slugs—very little wadding... all crowded into a rusty-looking sort of blunderbuss barrel, as it were—capped with a percussion preface—and cocked with a title page as apropos as a wink to a joke\". Henry Wadsworth Longfellow compared it to Lord Byron's \"English Bards\" as being \"full of wild wit and deviltry, and amazingly clever\". Freeman Hunt reviewed the poem for Merchants' Magazine in December 1848 and remarked on how true the character assessments were: \"Our friends Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Whittier, Poe, and last but not least, Harry Franco, (Briggs,) are, in our judgment, as genuine life pictures as were ever sketched with pen or pencil, in prose or verse. The severity, if any, is lost in the general fidelity of the delineations.\"\n\nLowell's friends objected to the intense criticism of Fuller, specifically William Wetmore Story and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Edgar Allan Poe reviewed the work in the Southern Literary Messenger and called it \"'loose'—ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance\". His final judgment was that the work was not successful: \"no failure was ever more complete or more pitiable\".\n\nIn 1922, Amy Lowell, a later relative of the Lowell family, wrote a similar book which she titled A Critical Fable after she was lampooned by Robert Frost. In it, she pokes fun at contemporary poets like Frost, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot using the byline \"A Poker of Fun\". In the younger Lowell's version, the satire presents two people in conversation, including Lowell himself and a present-day critic. The critic particularly defends women poets against the elder Lowell's disdain for them and instead saves their harshest criticism for male writers.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nDuberman, Martin.

The poem is a parody of Horace's Ars Poetica and follows Horace's structure of praising writers in relation to their literary style, content and subject matter. The poem follows a schoolmaster, who is talking to a group of students. The master critizes the talented and famous writers, to the disapproval of the students. He then tells a story of four travelers; a literary critic, poet, metaphysical philosopher, and a theologian. They come upon a figure of Fame, who will allow only one to pass, and each makes the case for their profession. The Literary Critic, naturally, argues that he should be allowed to pass because of his impressive power. The Poet argues that his writing is more enjoyable, the Metaphilosopher claims that his ideas are based on abstract reasoning and thus more profound, and the Theologian also makes a case for his profession. Fame ultimately chooses the Theologian. In the last stanza, Lowell makes his point clear, when he says that \"the true mission of the critic is to discover how men might live, not how they write or talk\". He is advocating for the critics to evaluate people for their moral character, not for their ability to write about it. He is implying that we should not be too critical of others and take their literary works too seriously, but to take a more moral approach. This poem has been widely lauded as a classic example of Lowell’s wit and wisdom, and it has become a much-quoted work. It has been praised as a piece that speaks to humanity on a larger scale, while still remaining humorous. It has been used as an example of satire in both the classroom and in the popular media. It has been used to represent the idea that literature should be appreciated and evaluated on a humanitarian level, and not just on a technical level. Lowell's A Fable For Critics has come to be seen as one of the most important works in American poetry, as it speaks to the importance of critical thinking over technicality. It offers readers insight into Lowell's beliefs about the ultimate importance of being a moral citizen over being a well accomplished artist. It is a timeless warning against the dangers of uncritical judgement, and its message still resonates with readers today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18850823}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Compukit UK101\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Compukit UK101 microcomputer (1979) is a kit clone of the Ohio Scientific Superboard II single-board computer, with a few enhancements for the UK market - notably replacing the 24×24 (add guardband kit to give 32×32) screen display with a more useful 48×16 layout working at UK video frequencies. The video output is black and white with 256 characters generated by a two kilobyte ROM. It has no bit-mapped graphics capability. The video is output through a UHF modulator, designed to connect to a TV set.\n\nHistory \nThe UK101 design was published in Practical Electronics, a popular hobbyists magazine at the time. The August, September, October and November 1979 issues carried the four parts of the article, credited to \"Dr A. A. Berk\". Later issues of the magazine contained information on modifications and additions to the machine, including a series of articles on building an expansion unit.\n\nKits of parts for building the machine were available from CompShop Ltd of 14 Station Road, Barnet, Hertfordshire. It is thought that around 5000 kits were produced.\n\nDescription\n\nProcessor \nThe Compukit UK101 is powered by a 6502 microprocessor CPU running at 1 MHz, and is equipped with up to 8 kilobytes of RAM using 2114 static RAM chips of 1024×4-bit. An additional memory-mapped 1 KB of RAM is used for the video display. It has the 8K Microsoft BASIC interpreter stored in ROM. In addition to Basic, a 6502 machine code monitor (2K bytes) is built into ROM. It allows programming by entering sequences of 6502 opcodes. Later a two-pass assembler was available which allows the use of assembly language.\n\nAlthough the 6502 has two interrupt input pins (NMI and IRQ), neither is used by the UK101.\n\nDisplay \nThe UK101 has a 16-row, 48-column memory-mapped video display. All scrolling and character output functions are handled by firmware. In the original ROMs, the output functions were rudimentary and did not include a clear-screen function. CPU access to video memory causes noticeable glitches (known as \"snow\") on the screen.\n\nKeyboard \nThe keyboard of the UK101 is located on the main PCB, and comprises a matrix of keyswitches. The matrix is interfaced to the CPU via two 8-bit I/O ports, and is polled by firmware in the machine's ROMs. One key is a latching type, the shift-lock key. When supplied as a kit, the keyboard was assembled by the purchaser from a bag of switches and keytops.\n\nThe keyboard ports are located at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input by using the PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, it is not possible to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.\n\nProgram Storage \nIn common with other home computers of the time, software can be saved and loaded on standard cassette tapes. The UK101 uses the Kansas City standard tape format. I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, with the addition of a few extra components and minor modifications to existing jumpers on the board.\n\nCompared to the Superboard \nAlthough very similar to the Ohio Scientific Superboard II, the Compukit UK101 differed from that machine in a few places:\n\n1. Video display of the UK101 works at UK frequency and resolution. \n\n2. RF output is UHF, to suit domestic TVs in the UK. \n\n3. Power supply is located on the main PCB and accepts UK 240 V AC mains input (via a transformer). \n\n4. Display improved to 48 characters per line\n\n5. Memory increased to 8 KB\n\nHowever, similarities in the PCB layout make it clear that this machine is a clone. The people involved with the modifications were Chris Cary and Bill Wood.\n\nExpansion \nThe 40 pin expansion socket opened up the world to the UK101. One could attach a dual floppy disk controller (5.25\") and a memory expansion card (40K max) to allow faster and reliable save/load of programs/data.\n\nA sound card became available, built around the General Instrument AY-3-8910, which together with a Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) WDC_65C21 chip, gave the UK101 audio abilities.\n\nThe UK101 floppy disk interface utilised a PIA to control the floppy disk drive stepper motor and another ACIA to serialise the data written to the disk.\nA disk operating system was used to provide file storage capability but this resided in RAM and so reduced the available program space.\nTypically single or double sided 40 track floppy drives could be supported.\n\nThe power consumption of an expanded UK101 could require up to 5Amps at 5.0Vdc (25Watts), so heat dissipation and power supply de-coupling were common challenges. Compare with a modern ARM microcontroller with similar capability at 0.5 Watts.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n Compukit UK101 Home Page – At BeeJay's home page\n Ian's Compukit Home Page\n How to build a UK101\n Kansas City Tape Decoder\n A collection of UK101 software rescued from tapes\n\nEarly microcomputers\n6502-based home computers\nComputers designed in the United Kingdom\nHome computers\nProducts introduced in 1979", "machine_text": " The Compukit UK101 is an 8-bit home computer kit that allows those who purchase it to build their own computer. It was released in the early 1980s by Compukit Ltd, a British company based in Birmingham, UK. The UK101 was the successor to Compukit's earlier UK80 computer system. It was one of the first mainstream small computers to be sold in the form of a kit, where the user could buy the separate components, assemble them, and then hook up the system to a television or monitor to begin using it. It was very popular in the early stages of the home computer revolution in Britain, as it was an affordable way for those interested in technology to get their hands on a fully-functional computer. Compukit was known for their \"build it yourself\" philosophy and for making their pre-assembled and tested models accessible to a wide variety of users. The pre-assembled version of the UK101 could even be purchased ready to go, although most users preferred to get all the components and put them together for themselves as a fun project. The UK101 was powered by an 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 processor running at 1.77 MHz. It featured 16 KB of RAM and could be connected to a standard analog television or monitor in order to display the user's work. It had a built-in cassette recorder for loading and saving programs, but a few of the Compukit models also came with a 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, allowing for faster data loading and storage. The UK101 was available with two different operating systems. The built-in ROM supported Basic 4.0 programming, and the optional MicroDOS Disk Operating System was also available as an add-on. Compukit also released a few extra interface cards, such as a serial port interface that allowed the UK101 to connect to printers, and a RAM expansion card that provided the user with 32 KB of extra memory. This additional RAM was necessary if the user wanted to install extra disk-based programs. In conclusion, the Compukit UK101 was one of the very first home computer sets available to the public Markets, and its builders could not only have hours of fun putting it together but it also consisted of everything they needed for their first computing experiences.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 980492}

The park's varied terrain and scenic views make it a popular destination for hikers from the Boston area.\n\nHistory\nEuropean colonizers sailing the coastline noticed the bluish hue of the mountains, which is caused by the presence of riebeckite, which gave area its modern name. The name of the state of Massachusetts derives from the Massachusett Indian tribe's name of the hill: massa-adchu-es-et. In 1893, the Metropolitan Parks Commission purchased the lands of Blue Hills Reservation as one of the state's first areas dedicated to public recreation.\n\nThe practice of First Day Hikes to mark New Year's Day with an outdoor activity began in 1992 at Blue Hills Reservation.  By the 2010s, the idea had spread and such hikes were taking place in state parks nationwide.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe ecology of the Blue Hills is diverse and includes marshes, swamps, upland and bottomland forests, meadows, and an Atlantic white cedar bog.  A number of endangered species in Massachusetts, such as the timber rattlesnake and copperhead snake, reside in the reservation. Other flora and fauna include dogwood, lady's slipper, white-tailed deer, coyotes, wild turkey, red fox, and turkey vultures.\n\nClimate \nThe reservation experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb), typical of most of New England. Summers are short but very warm with mild nights. Winters are short, very snowy, and very cloudy. Precipitation is heavy and very consistent year round.\n\nPoints of interest\n\nObservatory\nThe highest point within the reservation, Great Blue Hill in Milton, is the site of the historic Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory. The observatory was founded in 1885 and is the oldest continuous weather recording station in the United States. Its tower offers views of Boston and the surrounding area. The tower and observatory are among numerous reservation features listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFeatures listed on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nBlue Hills Trailside Museum\n\nThe Blue Hills Trailside Museum, which is operated by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, offers indoor and outdoor animal exhibits.\n\nActivities and amenities\n\nBlue Hills Reservation is primarily used for hiking and mountain biking. It is also used for snowshoeing, downhill skiing, and cross country skiing during winter, and rock climbing (in certain areas) and horseback riding during permissible months. Between approximately December and March, Great Blue Hill offers a ski area. Houghton's Pond and nearby Ponkapoag Pond are popular swimming and recreation areas during the summer.

Blue Hills Reservation covers more than 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of forests, wetlands, rivers, lakes, bogs and hills. The highest point within the park's boundaries is Great Blue Hill, rising 635 feet (194 meters) from the sea level. This hill, with its five subsidiary peaks, is the most prominent feature of the northeastern landscape, visible for miles around and is part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. In addition to offering a view of the greater Boston area, the reservation offers many recreational opportunities such as hiking, biking, fishing, boating, camping, cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, rock-climbing, nature walks, and more. Owing to its proximity to the sea, mountain, and wetlands, the diversity of its flora and fauna is astounding. The local Native American Mi'kmaqs refer to the reservation as \"Mattakeesett,\" which means \"place of hills.\" Over the years, the reservation has become an important refuge for many species of plants and animals. Hundreds of migratory birds, including hawks and eagles, use the reservation as part of their annual migratory route. Local mammals such as beavers, otters, and deer can often be seen in the reservation's forested areas. The Blue Hills Reservation is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) of Massachusetts. It is regularly patrolled by park rangers, the Massachusetts State Police and the Environmental Police. The DCR plans and implements programs to protect endangered species, preserve ecological integrity, and provide for public access and recreational use. Rangers and staff organize events such as Family Adventure Days, storywalks, nature hikes, and other activities for families and school groups.

The first collaborator on the album was LeAnn Rimes, who recorded the track, \"When You Love Someone Like That\" which also appeared on LeAnn Rimes's Family album that same year. Jurek called the duet between the pair \"stellar,\" while about.com called the pairing \"an undeniable outcome of perfection. Reba's strong country voice with LeAnn's young, soulful sound created a new sound like no other.\"\n\nThe second track, \"Does That Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma\" was a collaboration with Ronnie Dunn (half of the duo Brooks & Dunn), who co-wrote the song with McEntire. The third track is a duet with Kelly Clarkson on one of her previous major pop hits, \"Because of You.\" The song was the album's lead single and had already peaked at #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart at the time of the album's release. The song was criticized by allmusic, saying that, \"the song is simply a big, overblown power ballad with guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals -- think Jim Steinman and you get it.\" The same idea was also said about the fourth track, \"Faith In Love\" with Rascal Flatts. The fifth track was performed with country artist, Trisha Yearwood on the song, \"She Can't Save Him\", which was formerly released as a single by Canadian country artist, Lisa Brokop. Tracks six and seven were collaborations with American pop artist, Carole King and country artist, Kenny Chesney, who both help in providing musical variations towards the album. Country Standard Time called track nine (a collaboration with Faith Hill called \"Sleeping with the Telephone\") \"tearful emotion.\"\n\nThe tenth track was a duet with Justin Timberlake on the song, \"The Only Promise That Remains\", which was co-written by Timberlake himself. The song is performed in Celtic melody and Timberlake performs harmony on most of the song's length. The album closes with \"Break Each Other's Hearts Again\", a duet with Don Henley.\n\nCritical reception\n\nReba: Duets gained fairly positive reviews from most music critics. Allmusic's Thom Jurek stated that although he considered it not to be a \"perfect record\", he did find the album to \"deliver\". Jurek concluded by saying, \"It's sincere, it's polished, and it's full of good to great songs delivered in mostly interesting ways.\" In his review, he gave the album three and a half out of five stars.\n\nReviewing the album, Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave praise to McEntire and her production on the release, saying, \"Give credit to McEntire for corralling the egos - including her own - and producing an album with depth, passion and a bunch of great voices.\"  About.com'''s Scott Sexton gave Reba: Duets four and a half out of five stars, overall stating, \"Reba McEntire has proven she can stand the test of time, and with some help from close friends she sounds better than ever.\" Reviewing Reba: Duets in 2007, Lana Cooper of PopMatters acclaimed McEntire's vocal strength in the album by saying, \"Reba's voice manages to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity.\" Cooper overall stated, \"Reba Duets is largely a strong showing.\"\n\nRelease and aftermathReba: Duets was originally planned to be released in April 2007, however the date was pushed to September 18 instead. The lead single, \"Because of You\" was released to radio May 15 and reached a peak of #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart and #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August, shortly before the album's release date. A week after the album's release, it became the United States' best-selling album of the week, debuting at number one on both the Top Country Albums and Billboard 200 albums charts, selling a total of 300,536 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It debuted at number 4 on the Canadian Album Charts. Reba Duets'' was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 2007, becoming her twentieth platinum album. The album's second single, \"The Only Promise That Remains\" (with Justin Timberlake) was released in November 2007, but only reached #72 on the Billboard Pop 100 and did not chart the Hot Country Songs list. The third single, \"Every Other Weekend\" (with Kenny Chesney) was released in 2008. However, the official single featured Skip Ewing as the duet partner instead of Chesney, due to the Chesney version not being \"viable\" for radio (due to radio company issues). It charted outside the main UK top 100 album chart but has sold over 15,000 copies in the UK. McEntire and LeAnn Rimes performed their duet of \"When You Love Someone Like That\" at the 41st CMA Music Awards.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nMusicians \n\n Reba McEntire – lead vocals\n Matt Rollings – Hammond B3 organ (1), acoustic piano (1, 6, 11)\n  John Barlow Jarvis – acoustic piano (2-5, 9)\n Steve Nathan – Hammond B3 organ (2, 7, 8)\n Jimmy Nichols – synthesizer (3, 4, 5, 8), acoustic piano (7), Hammond B3 organ (9)\n Pete Wasner – acoustic piano (8)\n Michael Thompson – acoustic guitar (1), electric guitar (1)\n Tom Bukovac – electric guitar (1-10), acoustic guitar (10, 11)\n Ilya Toshinsky – acoustic guitar (2-5, 7-10)\n Dean Parks – acoustic guitar (6), electric guitar (11)\n Jay Dee Maness – steel guitar (1, 6, 11)\n Paul Franklin – steel guitar (2-5, 7, 8, 9)\n Rob Ickes – dobro (10)\n Aubrey Haynie – fiddle (2, 7, 10), mandolin (3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10)\n Leland Sklar – bass guitar (1, 6, 11)\n Jimmie Lee Sloas – bass guitar (2, 7, 8, 9)\n Glenn Worf – bass guitar (3, 5), upright bass (10)\n Jay DeMarcus – bass guitar (4), backing vocals (4)\n Russ Kunkel – drums (1, 6, 11)\n Greg Morrow – drums (2, 7-9)\n Paul Leim – drums (3, 5)\n Chris McHugh – drums (4)\n Bergen White – string arrangements and conductor (3, 7)\n Carl Gorodetzky – string contractor (3, 7)\n The Nashville String Machine – strings (3, 7)\n Larry Gold – string arrangements and conductor (10)\n Caroline Buckman – strings (10)\n Alyssa Park – strings (10)\n Amy Wickman – strings (10)\n LeAnn Rimes – lead vocals (1)\n Ronnie Dunn – lead vocals (2)\n Curtis Wright – backing vocals (2)\n Jenifer Wrinkle – backing vocals (2)\n Kelly Clarkson – lead vocals (3)\n Gary LeVox – lead vocals (4)\n Joe Don Rooney – backing vocals (4)\n Trisha Yearwood – lead vocals (5)\n Carole King – lead vocals (6)\n Kenny Chesney – lead vocals (7)\n Vince Gill – lead vocals (8)\n Ashley Cleveland – backing vocals (8)\n Kim Keyes – backing vocals (8)\n Judson Spence – backing vocals (8)\n Faith Hill – lead vocals (9)\n Justin Timberlake – lead vocals (10)\n Matt Morris – backing vocals (10)\n Don Henley – lead vocals (11)\n\nProduction notes \n\n Tony Brown – producer (1-9, 11)\n Reba McEntire – producer (1-9, 11)\n Dann Huff – producer (9)\n Justin Timberlake – producer (10)\n Mike Butler – recording (1)\n Derek Bason – additional recording (1, 2, 10), recording (2, 7, 8, 9), mixing (2, 7, 8)\n Nate Hertweck – recording assistant  (1)\n Todd Tidwell – additional recording (1, 2), recording assistant (1, 2, 7, 8, 9)\n Chuck Ainlay – recording (3, 4, 5, 10, mixing (3, 4, 9)\n Kyle Lehning – additional recording (3, 7, 11), mixing (11)\n Aaron Kasdoff – recording assistant (3, 4, 5, 10, 11), additional recording (5, 6, 11)\n Casey Wood – additional recording (3, 7, 11), recording assistant (3, 7, 11)\n David Bryant – additional recording,  (4, 5, 6, 9, 11), recording assistant ( (4, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n Ben Fowler – additional recording (4, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n Jeff Balding – additional recording (5, 6, 11)\n Al Schmitt – recording (6, 11)\n Steve Genewick – recording assistant (6, 11)\n Mark Hagen – additional recording (9)\n Seth Morton – additional recording (9), recording assistant (9)\n Kevin Mills – additional recording (10), recording assistant (10)\n Jeff Rothschild – additional recording (10)\n Steve Marcantonio – mixing (1, 6)\n J.C.

He received his diploma in 1975, from École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, after studying under the artist Alexander Calder. Bucher's focus has been on social sculpture and he has been engaged in a process of creating ‘living sculptures’ that have their own autonomous existence, independent from their creator. He has placed particular emphasis on the creation of forms that are both temporal and spatial, where he can actually inhabit and become a part of his work rather than just seeing it from afar. Consequently, Bucher's work looks to involve the senses. Many of his sculptures are built with materials which are visible, touchable and interact with their surroundings and the environment. Bucher regards the notion of ‘morality of form’ as being of major importance and often incorporates the idea into his works, believing that art must be ‘read’. In his art, Bucher has used found objects or materials allocated to a particular place – such as abandoned buildings or roads – to explore the transformation of places and peoples. In his 2000 piece La Pointe du Tournon, Bucher used stones sourced from the farmland of the region to reflect the memories of local people and their connection to the land. Bucher has also made temporary sculptures, performances and ephemeral installations as part of his exploration into the concept of impermanence and disappearance. One of his achievements was a piece entitled, Paillis-Eulette (Straw-Eulette), a woven straw and rope installation in 2003. Bucher's work has been exhibited extensively in France, Spain, Germany, South Korea, Canada and the United States. In 2014, his work was included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial and Documenta in Kassel, Germany.

The popular belief being that only brave warriors who are pure of heart can reach the peak. According to local legend, Ustra Peak is the abode of Lord Shiva, who is said to have resided on the mountain for eternity. The peak is mostly covered by snow throughout the year. The area surrounding Ustra peak comprises of stands of high altitude vegetation like junipers, rhododendrons, firs and cedars. Reaching Ustra Peak is a daunting task, as it is one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas. An expedition to the peak requires specialized knowledge and experience on mountaineering, trekking and camping. The routes that lead to the peak go through mud and rock hills, narrow ridges and snow-covered ridges. Moreover, the weather conditions vary greatly and climbers must be prepared for extreme weather. The peak was first climbed in 1968 by a group of mountaineers from the North East Frontier Agency, who were led by Captain Atulya K Nag.

The tree grows to around 8–15 metres (25–50 feet) in height and features an open, spreading crown of long, thick leaves. Its bark is grey and peels off in strips which gives way to a smooth, grey surface beneath. Its white or cream-colored flowers bloom in the late spring between August and October, providing a stunning display of color. The species is unique to the Gippsland area and is restricted to a number of small populations in the region, making it vulnerable to threats such as land clearing, grazing, and weed encroachment. E. olsenii has been listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Australian Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Conservation efforts to protect the species include mapping of the remaining populations and control of threats, including weed encroachment and fire management. Eucalyptus olsenii has a number of notable characteristics which make it a popular species for use in landscaping, especially in areas of coastal exposure. Its hardy nature, fast growth, and attractive foliage provide an excellent feature to gardens. It is also widely used in rural settings as a windbreak or live fence and can be an ideal choice for coastal revegetation. A related species, E. leiopantha, is also commonly used for landscaping. The species is popularly cultivated for its ornamental value, but it also has potential for production of honey, oils and fodder. Its honey is dark and highly valued, while its foliage makes a valuable fodder source for livestock. Eucalyptus olsenii is named after Australian botanist Frederick William Olsen. It was first described by John Cummings In 1960 and the type specimen collected in Gippsland.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paris meridian\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Paris meridian is a meridian line running through the Paris Observatory in Paris, France – now longitude 2°20′14.02500″ East. It was a long-standing rival to the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian of the world. The \"Paris meridian arc\" or \"French meridian arc\" (French: la Méridienne de France) is the name of the meridian arc measured along the Paris meridian. \n\nThe French meridian arc was important for French cartography, inasmuch as the triangulations of France began with the measurement of the French meridian arc. Moreover, the French meridian arc was important for geodesy as it was one of the meridian arcs which were measured in order to determine the figure of the Earth via the arc measurement method. The determination of the figure of the Earth was a problem of the highest importance in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the Earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.\n\nHistory\n\nFrench cartography and the figure of the Earth \n\nIn the year 1634, France ruled by Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, decided that the Ferro meridian should be used as the reference on maps, since El Hierro (Ferro) was the most western position of the Ptolemy's world map. It was also thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of Paris. The astronomers of the French Academy of Sciences, founded in 1666, managed to clarify the position of El Hierro relative to the meridian of Paris, which gradually supplanted the Ferro meridian. In 1666, Louis XIV of France had authorized the building of the Paris Observatory. On Midsummer's Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building's outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north–south. French cartographers would use it as their prime meridian for more than 200 years. Old maps from continental Europe often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom.\n\nA French astronomer, Abbé Jean Picard, measured the length of a degree of latitude along the Paris meridian (arc measurement) and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1668–1670. The application of the telescope to angular instruments was an important step. He was the first who in 1669, with the telescope, using such precautions as the nature of the operation requires, measured a precise arc of meridian (Picard's arc measurement). He measured with wooden rods a baseline of 5,663 toises, and a second or base of verification of 3,902 toises; his triangulation network extended from Malvoisine, near Paris, to Sourdon, near Amiens. The angles of the triangles were measured with a quadrant furnished with a telescope having cross-wires. The difference of latitude of the terminal stations was determined by observations made with a sector on a star in Cassiopeia, giving 1° 22′ 55″ for the amplitude. The terrestrial degree measurement gave the length of 57,060 toises, whence he inferred 6,538,594 toises for the Earth's diameter.\n\nFour generations of the Cassini family headed the Paris Observatory. They directed the surveys of France for over 100 years. Hitherto geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the magnitude of the Earth considered as a sphere, but a discovery made by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form. This astronomer, having been sent by the Academy of Sciences of Paris to the island of Cayenne (now in French Guiana) in South America, for the purpose of investigating the amount of astronomical refraction and other astronomical objects, observed that his clock, which had been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes and a half daily at Cayenne, and that in order to bring it to measure mean solar time it was necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line (about 1⁄12th of an in.). This fact, which was scarcely credited till it had been confirmed by the subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes on the coasts of Africa and America, was first explained in the third book of Newton’s Principia, who showed that it could only be referred to a diminution of gravity arising either from a protuberance of the equatorial parts of the Earth and consequent increase of the distance from the centre, or from the counteracting effect of the centrifugal force. About the same time (1673) appeared Christiaan Huygens’ De Horologio Oscillatorio, in which for the first time were found correct notions on the subject of centrifugal force. It does not, however, appear that they were applied to the theoretical investigation of the figure of the Earth before the publication of Newton's Principia. In 1690 Huygens published his De Causa Gravitatis, which contains an investigation of the figure of the Earth on the supposition that the attraction of every particle is towards the centre. \n\nBetween 1684 and 1718 Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Jacques Cassini, along with Philippe de La Hire, carried a triangulation, starting from Picard's base in Paris and extending it northwards to Dunkirk and southwards to Collioure. They measured a base of 7,246 toises near Perpignan, and a somewhat shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had an amplitude of 2° 12′ 9″, obtained 56,960 toises for the length of a degree; while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6° 18′ 57″, they obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, with the degree diminishing with increasing latitude, the Earth must be a prolate spheroid. This conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of Newton and Huygens, and accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other — one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a high latitude. Thus arose the celebrated , to the Equator and to Lapland, the latter directed by Pierre Louis Maupertuis.\n\nIn 1740 an account was published in the Paris Mémoires, by Cassini de Thury, of a remeasurement by himself and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille of the meridian of Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five stations. The results previously obtained by Giovanni Domenico and Jacques Cassini were not confirmed, but, on the contrary, the length of the degree derived from these partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with increasing latitude.\n\nThe West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc \nCesar-François Cassini de Thury completed the Cassini map, which was published by his son Cassini IV in 1790. Moreover, the Paris meridian was linked with international collaboration in geodesy and metrology. Cesar-François Cassini de Thury (1714-1784) expressed the project to extend the French geodetic network all around the world and to connect the Paris and Greenwich observatories. In 1783 the French Academy of Science presented his proposal to King George III. This connection and a proposal from General William Roy led to the first triangulation of Great Britain. France and Great Britain surveys' connection was repeated by French astronomers and geodesists in 1787 by Cassini IV, in 1823-1825 by François Arago and in 1861-1862 by François Perrier.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1798 Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre surveyed the Paris meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona (see meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain). They extrapolated from this measurement the distance from the North Pole to the Equator which was 5 130 740 toises. As the metre had to be equal to one ten-millionth of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,296 lignes of the Toise of Peru (see below) and of the double-toise N° 1 of the apparatus which had been devised by Lavoisier and Borda for this survey at specified temperatures.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Paris meridian's arc was recalculated with greater precision between Shetland and the Balearic Islands by the astronomer François Arago, whose name now appears on the plaques or medallions tracing the route of the meridian through Paris (see below). Biot and Arago published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of \"Bases du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l'arc méridien compris entre les parallèles de Dunkerque et Barcelone\" (Basis for the decimal metric system or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona) by Delambre and Méchain.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero directed the survey of Spain. From 1870 to 1894 the Paris meridan's arc was remeasured by Perrier and Bassot in France and Algeria.  In 1879, Ibáñez de Ibero for Spain and François Perrier for France directed the junction of the Spanish geodetic network with Algeria.  This connection was a remarkable enterprise where triangles with a maximum length of 270 km were observed from mountain stations over the Mediterranean Sea. The triangulation of France was then connected to those of Great Britain, Spain and Algeria and thus the Paris meridian's arc measurement extended from Shetland to the Sahara.\n\nThe fundamental co-ordinates of the Panthéon were also obtained anew, by connecting the Panthéon and the Paris Observatory with the five stations of Bry-sur-Marne, Morlu, Mont Valérien, Chatillon and Montsouris, where the observations of latitude and azimuth were effected.\n\nGeodesy and metrology \nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Wilhelm von Struve invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. Notably the geodetic standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the toise, of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for Bouguer and De La Condamine as their standard of reference in the French Geodesic Mission, conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa.\n\nAlexander Ross Clarke and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the Europäische Gradmessung and the General Conference of the association proposed the metre as a uniform length standard for the Arc measurement and recommended the establishment of an International Metre Commission.\n\nThe Europäische Gradmessung decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Metre Convention was signed in 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. The first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures was the Spanish geodesist Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the Europäische Gradmessung from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the International Geodetic Association (German: Internationale Erdmessung) and Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the International Geodetic Association gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the Europäische Gradmessung proposed to select the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian in the hope that Great Britain would accede to the Metre Convention.\n\nFrom the Paris meridian to the Greenwich meridian \nThe United States passed an Act of Congress on 3 August 1882, authorizing President Chester A. Arthur to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world. Before the invitations were sent out on December 1, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways' General Time Convention and Managing Editor of the Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways, had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883 across the nation. Although this was not legally established until 1918, there was thus a strong sense of fait accompli that preceded the International Meridian Conference, although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference.\n\nIn 1884, at the International Meridian Conference in Washington DC, the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the prime meridian of the world. San Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against. France and Brazil abstained. The United Kingdom acceded to the Metre Convention in 1884 and to the International Geodetic Association in 1898. In 1911, Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert stated in the Encyclopædia Britannica :\n\n\"According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, a [the equatorial radius of the Earth] = 6,377,935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15. [...] The net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the meridian of Greenwich is nearer the mean than that of Paris (Helmert, Grösse d. Erde).\"\n\nThe French clung to the Paris meridian as a rival to Greenwich until 1911 for timekeeping purposes and 1914 for navigation. To this day, French cartographers continue to indicate the Paris meridian on some maps.\n\nFrom wireless telegraphy to Coordinated Universal Time \nWith the arrival of wireless telegraphy, France established a transmitter on the Eiffel Tower in order to broadcast a time signal. The creation of the International Time Bureau, seated at the Paris Observatory, was decided upon during the 1912 Conférence internationale de l'heure radiotélégraphique. The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an international convention. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of World War I. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the International Commission of Time, one of the commissions of the then newly founded International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nFrom 1956 until 1987 the International Time Bureau was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of Atomic Time were taken over by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the celestial reference frame and the Earth's rotation in order to realize the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) were taken over by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) which was established in its present form in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).\n\nThe Arago medallions \n\nIn 1994 the Arago Association and the city of Paris commissioned a Dutch conceptual artist, Jan Dibbets, to create a memorial to Arago.  Dibbets came up with the idea of setting 135 bronze medallions (although only 121 are documented in the official guide to the medallions) into the ground along the Paris meridian between the northern and southern limits of Paris: a total distance of 9.2 kilometres/5.7 miles. Each medallion is 12 cm in diameter and marked with the name ARAGO plus N and S pointers.\n\nAnother project, the Green Meridian (An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte), aimed to establish a plantation of trees along the entire length of the meridian arc in France. Several missing Arago medallions appear to have been replaced with the newer 'An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte' markers.\n\nEsoteric interpretations \n\nIn certain circles, some kind of occult or esoteric significance is ascribed to the Paris meridian; sometimes it is even perceived as a sinister axis. Dominique Stezepfandts, a French conspiracy theorist, attacks the Arago medallions that supposedly trace the route of \"an occult geographical line\". To him the Paris meridian is a \"Masonic axis\" or even \"the heart of the Devil.\"\n\nHenry Lincoln, in his book The Holy Place, argues that various ancient structures are aligned according to the Paris meridian. They even include medieval churches, built long before the meridian was established according to conventional history, and Lincoln finds it obvious that the meridian \"was based upon the 'cromlech intersect division line'.\" David Wood, in his book Genesis, likewise ascribes a deeper significance to the Paris meridian and takes it into account when trying to decipher the geometry of the myth-encrusted village of Rennes-le-Château: The meridian passes about 350 metres (1,150 ft) west of the site of the so-called \"Poussin tomb,\" an important location in the legends and esoteric theories relating to that place. A sceptical discussion of these theories, including the supposed alignments, can be found in Bill Putnam and Edwin Wood's book The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château - A mystery solved.\n\nThe meridian line, dubbed the \"Rose Line\" by author Dan Brown appeared in the novel The Da Vinci Code.\n\nSee also \n French cartography\n Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790)\n Principal Triangulation of Great Britain\n Meridian arc\n History of geodesy\nHistory of the metre\nSeconds pendulum\n Struve Geodetic Arc\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n   Better formatted mathematics at Wikisource.\n The Arago medallions on Google Earth\n Full Meridian of Glory: Perilous Adventures in the Competition to Measure the Earth: history of science book by Prof. Paul Murdin\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian, by Graham Dolan\n\nNamed meridians\nGeography of Paris\nGeography of France\nHistory of Paris\nPrime meridians\nGeodesy\nMetrology\nGeography of England\nGeography of Spain\nGeography of Algeria\nParis Observatory", "machine_text": " The Paris Meridian (Meridian of Paris) is a line of longitude that runs through the French Capital of Paris, is the zero degree reference line for all French cartography, and is described as being at 30 minutes longitude east of Greenwich. Its origin dates back to the year 1666, when Louis XIV commissioned the astronomer Jean Picard to carry out a survey of the entire kingdom of France. During this survey, Picard chose the Observatory of Paris as the center of his measurements. The result was the establishment of the Paris Meridian, set at two degrees east of Greenwich. The Paris Meridian was used by cartographers to construct the official map of France in 1790. On the map of France, the 0 degree mark of this meridian ran from north to south, where it split the country into two equal parts. The meridian has subsequently been used to divide France into départements and as the baseline for the national grid system of metric coordinates. For the international community, the Paris Meridian was initially used as the standard of reference for longitude in 1884, when the International Meridian Conference agreed to adopt the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian for the world. Before the agreement, the location of the prime meridian was not consistently agreed upon and there were numerous suggestions of alternative prime meridians. One of these was the Paris Meridian, which was a highly suitable alternative, given that it was both known and had an easy to construct zero meridian passing through the principal city of a civilized nation. At the International Meridian Conference, William Ferrel, a meteorologist, argued in favor of Paris being used as the prime meridian, rather than Greenwich. However, Greenwich eventually won out by 26 votes, 13 to 10, over other contenders such as the Paris Meridian, Ferro Island and the Ile de France. Nevertheless, the Paris Meridian is still used as the zero degree reference line for French cartography. In Paris, there is a bronze line in the pavement which encircles the Observatory of Paris and marks the exact spot of the zero degree line of the Paris Meridian. In 2011, this spot served as one of the highlights of celebrations for the 375th anniversary of the Paris meridian, organized by the Paris Geographical Society. The Paris Meridian has been a source of much debate in the world of geography. In 1747, it was the center of a debate between Jean-Dominique Cassini and Pierre-Charles Brühl on the calculation of longitudes, which has been referred to as the \"Paris Meridian Affair\". The debate had implications for maritime navigation and the resolution of the dispute between the two men was a watershed moment in the development of geodesy and cartography. Today, the reference of the Paris Meridian has reduced in importance due to the widespread adoption of GPS for navigation and other applications. Nevertheless, it is still used in many parts of the world and its significance in French cartography and geodetic history remains.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2770302}

The show is hosted by Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky and co-hosted by Dr. Jonathan Arden. Autopsy featured real-life cases where investigators dissected the bodies of people who died mysteriously in order to determine the cause of death. Autopsy premiered on Discovery Life Channel on October 30, 2009. It was an hour-long show divided into two parts: an initial scene-setting introduction and a more in-depth investigation of the case. In each episode, forensic pathologists traveled to the scene of the death and interviewed family, friends, law enforcement, and medical personnel. They then conducted an on-camera autopsy in two parts: an external examination of the body and an internal in-depth dissection of the body to determine the cause of death. Whenever the cause of death wasn't immediately apparent, the pathologists had to draw on their expertise and knowledge to make a determination. During the course of the investigation, they relied on toxicology reports, microscopic studies, and lab tests to help them reach their conclusions. The most important tool in the Autopsy kit is its on-site forensic lab. There, the forensic pathologists have all the necessary equipment at their disposal, including a digital scale, an X-ray machine, a pH meter, and more. In order to efficiently carry out the investigation and clearly explain the results, the show brings along a number of special guests, including medical experts, criminalists, and law enforcement professionals. Autopsy is unique in its ability to show viewers the science behind determining cause of death, uncovering secrets along the way. It also brings attention to the importance of forensic pathologists and powerfully reveals the impact of sudden and unexpected death on families and communities. The show ended in 2016 after seven seasons and 112 episodes. In 2017, the Discovery Life Channel re-aired some of the episodes of Autopsy for several weeks. In 2018, the show was picked up and remastered for broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5870897}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Coffins on Io\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Coffins on Io is the seventh studio album by avant-garde band Kayo Dot, released in the UK on August 14, 2014 and in the US on October 13 through experimental metal label The Flenser. It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

He competed on the IAAF Race Walking Challenge in 2004, taking fourth in the Kunshan 20 km walk just one second off his personal best with a time of 1:20:55 hours.\n\nHe finished the distance in under one hour twenty minutes at the start of the 2005 season, crossing the line in a much improved time of 1:18:50 hours to place runner-up at the Dudinska Patdesiatka. He was sixth against an international field at the Grande Prémio Internacional de Rio Maior em Marcha Atlética and set a new best in the 50 kilometres race walk at 3:45:05 hours.

He was a major exponent of this style in the 1930s and 1940s and is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Chinese Socialist Realism.\" Lü studied sculpture at the Shanghai Art School, after which he attended the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts in Beijing. At the age of 27 he was appointed head of the sculpture department of the school, a position he held for the next seven years. He then became professor and head of sculpture at the National Art Institute of Shanghai. During this period he worked on many large-scale sculptures depicting not only historical figures, but also workers and peasants in the “model” style of the day. His most famous works include a series of figures of the Communist martyrs executed during the 1927 Shanghai Massacre, and a large-scale sculpture of Chinese leader Mao Zedong. In 1951, Lü was appointed vice president of the Academy of Arts and Crafts of Shanghai and soon became president. In 1952 he became the first Chinese professor of sculpture to receive a degree of Doctor of Arts. During this period he also wrote several books on sculpture. After the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Lü was elected vice chairman of the Chinese Art Society as well as curator of the Science and Technology Museum in Beijing. Throughout his career, Lü blended elements of classic Chinese sculpture with modern European abstractionism. His most important theme was portrayal of ordinary people, often the exploited toiling masses. He has been described as “an innovator in modernization, one of the first to blend western and classical Chinese techniques.” His sculptures are featured in museums and galleries all over the world. In his later years, Lü continued to work on large-scale sculptures and was awarded many awards for his achievements. He was a great advocate for the teaching of sculpture to young students and compiled many works featuring his sculptures for their benefit. In 1992, he was awarded the Chinese Top Ten Famous Sculptors award. Lü Ronghua was a pioneering sculptor, renowned for combining both traditional and modern elements in his work. His monuments to the people's struggles remain to this day a lasting tribute to the achievements of Chinese socialism.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48598805}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Year of the Spider\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Year of the Spider is the third studio album by American rock band Cold. It was released on May 13, 2003 through Geffen Records. The album was Cold's most commercially successful, debuting at number three on the Billboard album charts, with over 101,000 copies sold in its first week. Early pressings of Year of the Spider were shipped with a DVD and a temporary tattoo of the Cold spider logo. The DVD included the making of the (as well as the actual) video for \"Stupid Girl\", fan testimonials, and some home video shot during the recording of the album. This is also the last album with guitarists Terry Balsamo and Kelly Hayes.\n\nBackground\nA year prior to the album's release, the mellow ballad \"Gone Away\" was released on the WWE Tough Enough 2 soundtrack. Its music video, which met with considerable airplay upon release, listed it as from the album Year of the Spider despite the long wait for its release. \"Gone Away\" was subsequently used as a hidden track; the song begins at 16:06 after 13 minutes and 13 seconds of silence (a reference to the superstitious nature of the band's previous effort 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage). The song \"Came All The Way\" was a B-side, which was cut late from the album. It's mentioned on the back cover of the album's booklet. It was later released on the Psi Ops soundtrack.\n\nThe album was frequently postponed from its projected release date. As early as April 2002, Year of the Spider was scheduled by Geffen for an October 2002 release. Frontman Scooter Ward also expected Elias Soriano of Nonpoint to contribute, but this did not come to fruition.\n\nStyle\nWith producer Howard Benson on hand, Year of the Spider is significantly more commercial than its dark predecessor, 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage. It features a variety of guitar styles, violin, viola, and cello, and digital effects as well as a number of power ballads. While still dwelling on topics like drug abuse and relationships, the deaths of grunge icons (\"The Day Seattle Died\"), and blatant criticism (\"Kill the Music Industry\"). \"Cure My Tragedy\" also deals with the struggle with cancer Scooter Ward's sister was having during the album's recording. This topic would be further explored on A Different Kind of Pain.\n\nSingles\n\"Stupid Girl\", served as the album's lead single and was the only Cold single to crack the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 87. Its music video garnered frequent airplay as well. Like \"Gone Away\", the introductory song \"Remedy\" was used by WWE as the theme for the Backlash 2003 pay-per-view.\n\nFollowing the release of the album's second single, \"Suffocate\", to radio stations, plans were set-forth for a video to accompany the song. However, for reasons unknown, Geffen refused to make the video or promote the album any further. The stalemate with the label led to frustrations within the band, and in early 2004, Terry Balsamo departed, replacing Ben Moody as lead guitarist in Evanescence. Balsamo was later replaced by ex-Darwin's Waiting Room guitarist Eddie Rendini. The band made efforts to release another single in \"Wasted Years\", but Geffen stayed true to their earlier promise by not financing or promoting the album any further.\n\nTrack listing \n(All songs written by Scooter Ward, except where noted)\n\n\"Gone Away\" is embedded with \"Kill the Music Industry\", and begins at 16:06 after 13:13 of silence – a reference to the superstitious nature of their previous effort 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from album's liner notes.\n\nCold\n Scooter Ward – vocals \n Kelly Hayes – guitar\n Jeremy Marshall – bass guitar\n Terry Balsamo – electric and acoustic guitar\n Sam McCandless – drums\n\nAdditional musicians\n Howard Benson – piano solo , keyboards and programming\n Samuel Fischer – violin \n Julie Gigante – violin \n Roland Kato – viola \n Armen Ksajikian – cello \n Ana Landauer – violin \n Songa Lee – violin \n Phillipe Levy – violin \n David Low – cello, contractor \n Deborah Lurie – conductor and string arrangements \n Simon Oswell – viola \n David Speltz – cello \n Sierra Swan – vocals \n Michael Valerio – string bass \n Evan Wilson – viola \n\nArtwork\n Jason Harter – art direction, design\n Olaf Heine – photography\n\nProduction\n Dan Adam – digital editing\n Howard Benson – producer, programming\n Ted Jensen – mastering\n Vince Jones – digital editing\n Jason Lader – digital editing\n Chris Lord-Alge – mixing\n Eric Miller – digital editing, additional engineering\n Mike Plotnikoff – engineer, digital editing\n Mark Robertson – concertmaster\n Casey Stone – strings engineer\n\nManagement\n Scott Adair – business manager\n Sean Ballhorn – business manager\n Desiree Barlow – management\n Terri DiPaolo – legal representation\n Tom Donnell – merchandise\n Fred Durst – A&R\n Darryl Eaton – booking agent\n Paul Geary – management\n Dhenys Lau – merchandise\n Jenn Littleton – A&R\n Peter Lubin – merchandise\n Martie Muhoberac – production coordination\n Jordan Schur – executive producer, A&R\n Les Scurry – production coordination\n Ron Valeri – management\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nSingles – Billboard (North America)\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences\n\nCold (band) albums\n2003 albums\nGeffen Records albums\nAlbums produced by Howard Benson\nFlip Records (1994) albums", "machine_text": " The Year of the Spider refers to a period of time in 2019, during which the internet and technology industry experienced a series of significant changes, technological advances, and other notable occurrences.

A 100% approval rating for the third season was reported by Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 9/10 based on 5 reviews.\n\nAlan Sepinwall of Uproxx gave a mixed review of the series, criticizing the show's clichéd storytelling and pacing; the latter he observed, \"oddly feels sluggish and rushed at the same time, lingering over certain tasks and story beats... but then oddly jumping over story points in a way that had me frequently checking to be sure I hadn't skipped an episode by mistake.\" He further emphasized: \"Snowfalls not a bad drama at this stage, just more generic than it should be, especially on a channel known for making old TV ideas feel brand-new.\" \n\nMatt Zoller Seitz of Vulture, however, gave a positive review to Snowfall, praising \"the attention it pays to the sights, sounds and textures of people's lives in 1983 Los Angeles, and to fine details of characterization — in other words, the sort of stuff that would never get a dramatic series a green light unless drugs and violence were attached to it.\" He further stated: \"rather than go for a vibe like The Wire or Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, which explored the drug trade with a newspaperman's anthropological detachment, Snowfall aims for a bouncier, more seductive vibe.\" Seitz also praised the \"phenomenal\" acting of Idris, Peris-Mencheta, Hudson, and Rios.\n\nRatings\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nSeason 3\n\nSeason 4\n\nSeason 5\n\nBroadcast\nOutside of the United States, Snowfall premiered on BBC Two in the United Kingdom on October 8, 2017.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Death of Jason Callahan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jason Patrick Callahan (April 18, 1976 – June 26, 1995), previously known as Grateful Doe and Jason Doe, was an American man who was killed in a car accident on June 26, 1995, in Emporia, Greensville County, Virginia. His body remained nameless until December 9, 2015. Earlier in 2015, photographs of an unknown male surfaced on a Facebook page for the John Doe. DNA testing later confirmed Callahan to be the unidentified man.\n\nDeath\nCallahan was killed in a vehicle crash, along with the driver, Michael Hager, after the Vanagon in which they were riding crashed into a pair of trees on U.S. Route 58 West around 1:30 PM on June 26, 1995. Neither man was wearing a seat belt, which likely contributed to each of their deaths. Found with Callahan's body were two scalped Grateful Dead tickets, a dollar in quarters, and a yellow Bic lighter. A letter was found, depending on sources either in Callahan's pocket or near the crash site, reading: Jason, Sorry we had to go, see ya around, call me #914-XXXX. Caroline T. & Caroline O. Bye!!!!. The phone number on the letter lacked an area code and never led to any additional clues. The letter also contained a small drawing that some speculate may be of Jerry Garcia. The tickets were dated June 24, 1995, and June 25, 1995, respectively; the Grateful Dead performed at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on these dates. Authorities were able to trace the tickets to a Pennsylvania man, but the man turned out to be a ticket reseller and could not recall the details of who he sold them to. Neither of the 'Carolines' have ever been identified.\n\nPhysical description\n\nBefore he was identified, Callahan was estimated to be between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years old; he had brown eyes with long curly brown or dark blond hair that had been dyed a reddish color. There was a tattoo of a star on his upper-left arm and another possible tattoo, which was faded, on his right arm, both of which appeared to have been amateurishly executed. He was wearing a beaded necklace and his left ear had been pierced but he was not wearing an earring. There was a scar found on his back. He was a Caucasian, had no apparent dental work as his third molars were visible, and his teeth were fairly well cared for.  At the time of the accident he was wearing a red, tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirt, Levi's jeans, white socks and black Fila running shoes.\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe vehicle's driver was identified as Michael E. Hager, 21, who may have picked Callahan up as a hitchhiker. Neither of the decedents had drugs or alcohol in their bodies and there was no discernible external cause for the crash, so authorities hypothesized that Hager could have fallen asleep at the wheel. It has been suggested that Hager may have agreed to transport Callahan because of their similar styles of dress, as they both appeared to be fans of The Grateful Dead. Authorities attempted to identify Callahan through fingerprint analysis with the aid of national databases, but were unsuccessful.\n\nWhen interviewed, Hager's family could not identify the unknown passenger, who had been reported to have been riding in Hager's Volkswagen Vanagon when he stopped to give his father a letter in Williamsburg, Virginia. However, a detective from the area stated that this claim was not accurate, and that Hager was alone when he stopped to visit his father. It is speculated that Callahan had actually been picked up between Fairfax and Gloucester, Virginia.\n\nDue to the severity of the lacerations on Callahan's face, mortuary photographs were not released to the public, although a facial reconstruction was later released. In 2012, another facial reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The man who had originally bought the tickets found in Callahan's pocket did not remember the person to whom he had sold them. At least 221 missing people were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.\n\n2015 developments\n\nIn 2015, photographs surfaced of a young man wearing similar clothes to those worn by the then-unidentified Callahan, and who bore a strong resemblance to the reconstruction images. The person in these photographs was named Jason and was described to have been a fan of the Grateful Dead. He had not been heard from since 1995 and was known to have lived in both Illinois and South Carolina. It had not yet been verified whether this was indeed the John Doe as his former roommates and other friends did not recall Jason's last name.\nThe New York Post and BuzzFeed were some of the newspapers that covered the story.\n\nIn January 2015, law enforcement conducted a DNA test to see if the John Doe was the same man as Jason Patrick Callahan, the son of a 63-year-old woman who had not seen or heard from him since June 1995, when he left home to \"follow the Grateful Dead\". Callahan, who was identified as the young man in the photographs, is described as having been a white male with wavy blond hair and brown eyes, standing between  and  tall, and weighing about . Callahan, if he was alive, would have been 38 at the time. Callahan was not reported missing by his mother until 2015.\n\nLt. Joey Crosby, spokesman for Myrtle Beach police, stated that Callahan's mother failed to file a report with police due to the nomadic nature of Grateful Dead fans. \"She attempted to report it when he went missing but didn’t know which jurisdiction to report it to,\" he said. Callahan's family also stated that they presumed he had gone to \"live on his own, elsewhere.\"\n\nAfter initial tests proved inconclusive, additional DNA testing confirmed that the body was indeed that of Jason Callahan.\n\nSee also\n List of solved missing person cases\n\nReferences\n\n1990s missing person cases\n1995 in Virginia\nDeaths by person in the United States\nEmporia, Virginia\nFormerly missing people\nGrateful Dead\nMissing person cases in Virginia\nRoad incident deaths in Virginia", "machine_text": " Jason Callahan (August 16, 1994 - July 5, 2017) was an American college student who captured the attention of the American public after his death. He was 20 years old when he died of a drug overdose. At the time of his death, Callahan was a student at the University of Florida, studying computer engineering. He had been a high school athlete and was known for his positive attitude and willingness to help others. Prior to his death, Callahan had been struggling with a substance abuse problem that began when he was a freshman in college. He had tried to get help and had entered rehab once in 2016. Despite his efforts, the substance abuse continued until his death. In the days leading up to his death, Callahan had been living with friends and had skipped class on many occasions. His friends had noticed a change in his behavior and had expressed concern for his health. On the night of July 5th, 2017, Callahan was found unresponsive in his bedroom by his roommate. He was rushed to the hospital, but was pronounced dead upon arrival. The cause of death was suspected to be due to an overdose of heroin. Following the news of his death, the community of Gainesville, Florida held a memorial service for Jason Callahan which was attended by hundreds of people. His parents, friends, and even strangers expressed their sadness and disbelief at his passing. Jason Callahan's death is a reminder of the importance of addressing substance abuse. He is remembered for his vibrant personality, his athletic skills, and his passion for helping others. In more recent times, the University of Florida has established a scholarship in his name: The Jason Callahan Memorial Scholarship. The scholarship provides assistance to students studying computer engineering, a field that Jason was passionate about. The scholarship is awarded annually to a deserving student and is funded by donations from alumni and the community. Today, the memory of Jason Callahan lives on through the scholarship and through the many lives he has impacted. His name is remembered and his story is used to help spread awareness of the dangers of substance abuse and to encourage others to seek help.

The winner of the Race Off was the Czech Republic's Lukas Dryml and the runner-up was Russia's Emil Sayfutdinov. The meeting was marred by persistent rain, which caused flooding inside the stadium. Despite the wet weather, 23 riders took part in the Grand Prix. In the semi-finals, Tomasz Gollob beat compatriot Stefan Holder, while Krzysztof Kasprzak beat Denmark's Nicki Pedersen. In the final, Gollob and Kasprzak raced head-to-head for the victory. Gollob won four of the five heats, with Kasprzak winning the third heat.

It is part of the Epirus region. Its capital is the town of Arta.\n\nGeography\n\nThe regional unit of Arta is located north of the Ambracian Gulf. The main mountain ranges are the Athamanika in the northeast, the Pindus in the east, and Valtou in the southeast. Only one mountain road links Arta with the Pineios valley and Thessaly. There are low-lying agricultural plains in the west. Arta borders on the regional units of Preveza in the west, Ioannina to the north, Trikala in the east, Karditsa to the east and Aetolia-Acarnania to the south.\n\nThe main rivers are the Acheloos in the east, the Arachthos in the centre, and the Louros in the west. Most of the population lives in the west, in the Arachthos valley, south and east of Arta. The Athamanika and Valtou mountains are the least populated.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe regional unit Arta is subdivided into 4 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\nArta (1)\nCentral Tzoumerka (Kentrika Tzoumerka, 3)\nGeorgios Karaiskakis (2)\nNikolaos Skoufas (4)\n\nPrefecture\n\nArta was established as a prefecture in 1882 (). As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Arta was created out of the former prefecture Arta. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.\n\nHistory\nArta was one of the capitals of the Despotate of Epirus in the late Middle Ages. The territory of the regional unit was ceded to Greece in 1881 by the Ottoman Empire, along with Thessaly, in accordance with the 1878 Congress of Berlin. A famous landmark of Arta is the Old Bridge over the Arachthos river.\n\nTransport\n\nAs one of the first completed sections of the future Ionia Odos linking Ioannina with Patras and Kalamata, the motorway bypass of the GR-5 around Arta was opened in 1997.

It has an area of 1,880 square km (726 square miles) and a population of 41,820 (2011). The capital and largest city of the regional unit is Arta. Arta is situated between the Ambracian Gulf in the east and the mountains of Epirus in the west. The regional unit of Arta is named after the ancient city of Arta, an important center of the Aetolian League. A large part of its area is covered by the mountain range of Tzoumerka while the southern parts of Arta is mostly a hilly area. The mountain range of Tzoumerka is the highest in the region with altitudes up to 2,401 meters. The highest mountain is called Agioi Vlachoi and it's located near the village of Kalligoni. The main rivers flowing through Arta are the Arachthos and the Capros. The former river has its source at the mountain of Agioi Vlachoi and flows generally eastward until it reaches the Ambracian Gulf. The latter river is formed by the union of several smaller streams and flows through the plains of the regional unit in the northern direction until it meets the Arachthos. The main production activities in the district of Arta are focused around agriculture and livestock farming. The main agricultural products are olives, grapes, cotton and some vegetables, while the most important livestock production is related to sheep and goats.

With a uniquely soulful sound, Parke has been compared to '90s classics such as Damien Rice and Ben Harper. Parke began writing and performing from an early age. He took up guitar at the age of 9 and by 13 had written his first song. This musical ability was something he’d inherited from his father, an Irish singer/songwriter and musician. From 2008 - 2012 Parke worked on a series of acoustic albums, released independently and available to buy on his website. These albums earned him a dedicated following and gained him recognition in the music press, both in Ireland and the UK. In 2013, Parke was spotted busking in Covent Garden and was subsequently signed to UK-based record label '3Bears Recordings'. His debut single ‘In Time’ was released in 2014, preceded by the release of the critically acclaimed EP Breath Of Life. It featured co-writes with Chris Difford (Squeeze) and Adrian Tew (Amy Winehouse). Parke's music is a mix of folk and soul, crafted with thought-provoking lyrics and catchy melodies. He released two further singles in Spring 2015, the Joy Division-haired 'A thousand Islands' and 'The Turning Point' featuring the soulful voice of Lorna Thomas, who sang with him in his early circuit days. In 2016, Parke released his anticipated debut album Moving On to critical acclaim, with many critics touting it as a potential breakthrough record for the singer/songwriter. In his personal permformances, Parke is known for being able to captivate any audience with his music and hushed delivery. He has opened for acts such as Keane, Taylor Swift and Damien Rice, and in 2016 embarked on a tour of the UK supporting Bryde.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fairground (song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Fairground\" is a song by British soul and pop band Simply Red, released on 18 September 1995 as the first single from their fifth album, Life (1995). Co-written and co-produced by frontman Mick Hucknall, it makes extensive use of a sample of Dutch duo the Goodmen's 1993 hit \"Give It Up\". It became Simply Red's first and only  1 single on the UK Singles Chart, staying at the top for four weeks in September and October 1995, and was also a chart hit in mainland Europe and Australia, but failed to generate long-term success in North America.\n\nBackground and release\nWhen \"Fairground\" went straight to number-one in its first week on the UK Singles Chart, it had already been released to UK radio stations almost a month before, via satellite with the first promotional copies following a few days later. The single was placed in heavy rotation on Top 40 radio stations, which resulted in it reaching the top of the airplay charts, a position that was held for three weeks. When the single was released to the public on 18 September 1995, it had already been the most played record on British radio.\n\nComposition\nProducer Andy Wright has said that for Fairground, Mick Hucknall wanted to do a Brazilian, carnival-style track. Whilst Mick was at the dentist for two hours, Andy had the idea to sample a record that he knew of: Give It Up by The Goodmen, which in-turn sampled Fanfarra (Cabua-le-le) by Sérgio Mendes. To round out the track, Fritz McIntyre played the house-style piano element, Ian Kirkham used the EWI (electronic wind instrument) to play the clarinet-style part, and Andy Wright made the wobbly, dreamy sound heard in the verses.\n\nCritical reception\nSwedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted the \"hot rhythms and odd harmonies\" of the song, adding that the album \"would have needed even more such songs\". AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann said that Mick Hucknall \"opts for a Latin-tinged sound that ends up evoking Herb Alpert more than Milton Nascimento\". Another editor, Jon O'Brien deemed the song \"a mesmerizing fusion of tribal rhythms and ambient chillout pop\". Larry Flick from Billboard described it as an \"expectedly romantic soul tune\", adding that \"fueled by his now instantly familiar voice, the track combines old-school warmth with street-smart percussion that is largely derived from samples of \"Give It Up\" by the Goodmen. At the core are wonderfully soothing lyrics and a melody that permanently sticks to the brain upon impact.\" Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger commented that it \"surprised people at the time, and on the verses at least it's their strangest-sounding single. \"Driving down an endless road...\" it begins, and that's not at all a bad description of the lonesome vibe here – the odd combination of flowing, tumbling Latin percussion and Hucknall's ruminative vocal, working together to create something genuinely arresting, even haunting.\" \n\nPan-European magazine Music & Media noted that it is \"totally different from Hucknall's previous singles but still very much him thanks to the one-in-a-million voice and the trademark composition.\" They added that \"the fairground attraction\" of the single is its \"percussive arrangement and clubiness.\" A reviewer from Music Week rated it five out of five, picking it as Single of the Week. The reviewer added, \"No wonder radio has leapt on this, a charmingly-delivered song which couples instant commerciality in the tune stakes with a hip tribal backing. Headed straight for the summit.\" Alan Jones said, \"Despite its heavily syncopated underpinning, it is a stylish and straightforward pop song with Mick Hucknall's usual high calibre vocal and an instantly commercial chorus.\" James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update called it \"attractive\". People Magazine'''s reviewer wrote that the \"energetic\" song \"combines soulful abandon with tribal ecstasy.\" David Gaskey from The Rice Thresher described it as \"an innovative, futuristic jazz/pop song inspired by a popular fairground outside of Milan.\" Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits stated that Hucknall \"still has a lovely singing voice\". However, he felt the song \"sort of tinkles along merrily without really going anywhere.\"\n\nChart performance\nIt was the first and only single by the group to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It spent four weeks at the top, and fourteen weeks in the top 40. The track also reached No. 1 in Ireland and Italy and peaked within the top 10 in more than 10 countries, including Australia, Germany, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.

It was released as the second single from their album Life on the world of their fifth studio album. It became the band's third top five single in the United Kingdom, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart. The track was written by lead vocalist Mick Hucknall and co-produced by Stewart Levine and musician Heitor Pereira. It was released as a four-track CD single and maxi-single. The single includes various remixes of the song, including a \"Club Power Remix\". The song was also included in the compilation album The Greatest Hits in the late 1990s. Additionally, the song was featured in the movie Spy Hard and appeared on the soundtrack album of the same name. The song has a somber, mid-tempo tone, and its lyrics are about a \"fairground ride,\" where the singer is making allusions to the restlessness of a doomed relationship. The song was also a metaphor for Hucknall's mixed feelings about the band's newfound commercial success and the burden of fame and stardom. The accompanying music video for \"Fairground\" was directed by Mark Szaszy. It gained much attention and airplay due to its artistic, surreal nature, and was shot in black-and-white. The video follows several people and the narrator (Hucknall) as they wander through a mysterious fairground. The video won several awards, including an MTV Video Music Award in 1995. \"Fairground\" is one of Simply Red's best-known hits, becoming a top three hit in the UK and charting in Germany, Italy, and other countries. In the United States, however, the song did not receive much radio airplay and \"Fairground\" was not released as a single. Nonetheless, the song remains a fan favorite and often appears on set lists during Simply Red's live concerts.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14524920}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "From August 22 to August 24, 1992  violent xenophobic riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock, Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against migrants in postwar Germany. Stones and petrol bombs were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant right-wing extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.\n\nThe initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised. For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers. Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond, and, when they did, their responses were considered inadequate. Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for days with little or no access to basic facilities. This was contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.\n\nBetween 22 and 26 August 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former West Germany; 217 from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including 147 from Rostock; and another 37 from the former East Germany. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured. No one was killed.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Zentrale Aufnahmestelle für Asylbewerber für Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (ZAst M-V), or \"Central Refugee Shelter\" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was in an 11-storey plattenbau apartment complex known as the \"Sunflower House\" or \"Sunflower Tower\", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the asylum seekers there were living and the lack of support (if any) provided for them. The authorities had ignored  numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.\n\nRioting\nThe shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily Roma from Romania, they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.\n\nFor days prior to the riots, the newspapers Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten and Ostsee-Zeitung had been calling for a \"Lichtenhagen interest group\". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not \"cleaned up,\" order would be made. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year-old skinhead said, \"The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!\"\n\nThe first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged neo-Nazis to roam the area. This led to a situation where a xenophobic mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a ZDF television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Below, a mob of over 3,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.\n\nCharges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist police state. There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.\n\nThe first major conviction relating to the riots was on 4 March 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year-old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness. It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.\n\nThe following timeline was reconstructed by the \"Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident\" (\"Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst\").\n\nTimeline\n\nAugust 22, Day 1\nFrom about 6:00 p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02 p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46 p.m., police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02 p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24 p.m. another police unit arrived from Schwerin. At 1:34 a.m. water cannons were set up and put to continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34 a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the autobahn. At 2:25 a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30 a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued tear gas and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30 a.m.\n\nDay 1 Statistics: 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 1\n\n100 people gathered in front of the shelter. At 11:15 a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from Schwerin, Anklam, Stralsund and Güstrow. The Landespolizei force of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units (Einsatzhundertschaften) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15 p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known neo-Nazis in the area.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 2\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18 p.m. the rioters started throwing Molotov cocktails. 8:00 p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30 p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00 p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30 p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41 p.m. state police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).\n\nThe state level of emergency allowed for additional federal brigades to be called in.  Hamburg sent out its SWAT (SEK and MBK) units. These riot police units of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two police dog squads from Kiel, a reserve unit from Lübeck, and helicopters from the federal police.\n\nAt 2:55 a.m. The second Hamburg unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45 a.m. the first Hamburg unit arrived. At 4:10 a.m. the situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.\n\nDay 2 Statistics: 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 1\n\n2:00 p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action), the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00 p.m. The police learned of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively if the shelter was cleared out.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 2\n\n7:45 p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55 p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.\n\nAt 8:00 p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the second Hamburg unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05 p.m. squads from the second Hamburg unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using batons. The commanding officer of the first Hamburg unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, Hafenstraße and Flora.\n\nAt 8:15 p.m. The first Hamburg unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and police cordons were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was \"Officers in distress.\" The first Hamburg unit also provided support.\n\nAt 8:40 p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20 p.m. the retreating first Hamburg unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade MV. At 9:34 p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37 p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a police cordon and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55 p.m. the first Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began clearing out the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the second Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30 a.m. the area settled down.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00 a.m., the situation was under control.\n\nDay 3 Statistics: 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.\n\nCopycat acts\n\nIn the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis attacked 40 residences with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police.  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in Wismar, Rostock-Hinrichshagen, Lübz, and Neubrandenburg were attacked, and there were three such incidents in Greifswald. In Wismar there was a six-day riot between 15 and 20 September in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were attacks almost daily. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in Güstrow Ueckermünde Kröpelin, Schwarzendorf (in the district of Malchin), Schwerin, Wismar, and Retschow were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nThe attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild. \n\nCases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped. Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated between two and three years; the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.\n\nAn investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent Jürgen Deckert for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.\n\nMedia\n Mark Saunders. \"The Truth Lies in Rostock (AVI, 698,7 MB)]\" (BRD, Great Britain, 78 min.) /  1993 von Mark Saunders & Siobhan Cleary - 121 min\n Wir Sind Jung.

During the event, a mob of right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis attacked a building complex housing asylum seekers and set parts of it on fire. The events sparked widespread public debate and condemnation in Germany, leading to nationwide protests and criticism of the government's handling of the situation. The riots, described as a \"pogrom\" and \"Kristallnacht\" by some commentators, were triggered by a dispute between German locals and new immigration. Over the previous months, a wave of xenophobia had risen in the Rostock area, due in part to controversial statements about refugees from local politicians. On the afternoon of 22 August, around 200 people, many of them members of the neo-Nazi scene from other parts of Germany, gathered outside the building complex in the Lompower Ring neighborhood of Lichtenhagen. Many shouted racist epithets aimed at foreigners, and soon began throwing stones and other objects at the building. The police, caught unprepared for the mob, stood by as the building was set on fire and damaged, although some of the officers threw stones at the residents. By the evening, the crowd grew to over 1,000 people, and at times blocked firefighters from putting out the blaze, forcing local firefighters to wait for reinforcements from other parts of the state. As the violence continued, an additional 2,400 police and railway police were deployed to the area. In response to the crowd's actions, some 200 to 300 counter-protestors arrived to try to defend the building from the mob. The violence lasted until around midnight on 24 August, when the police regained control of the area after negotiations. Despite the efforts of the police to stop the rioting, more than 200 people were injured and several buildings and cars were set on fire. As a result of the events, the city of Rostock suffered considerable damage to its public image and relations with its immigrant community. In the aftermath of the riots, the government was criticized by both German and international officials for its failure to prevent the violence, while East German authorities were accused of not providing sufficient security to the asylum seekers. In response, both the local and national government pledged to take action to improve the situation. In 1993, the Bundestag passed a package of asylum-law reforms, including measures to speed up asylum procedures and improve the legal protection of asylum seekers, as a result of the protests. In the years that followed, a number of official efforts to address the underlying issues behind the riots have been initiated, including integration policies and forums for dialog between immigrants and local community members. In August 2012, the 20th anniversary of the riots was marked by a memorial service and conferences to commemorate the events and discuss their legacy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15563818}

From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).\n\nHistory \n\nShortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.\n\nA Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964–1968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.\n\nIn July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the  (FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.\n\nIn July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974–75 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 Aérospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.\n\nThe Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called \"special missions\", consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.\n\nIn the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. The  at Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.\n\nThe extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.\n\nThe FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.\n\nCurrent structure \nAs of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.\n\nLike the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.\n\nKnown chiefs of staff\nMajor General Faustin Munene in 1997\nBrigadier General Jean Bitanihirwa Kamara in 2005\nMajor General Djedje Ndamba in 2006\nMajor General John Numbi in 2007\nMajor General Rigobert Massamba Musungu from 2007\nBrigadier General (Major General from July 2018) Numbi Ngoie Enoch since 2014\n\nAircraft \nAccording to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.\nJane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.\nThe DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi.

It was founded in 1960 in the aftermath of the Congo Crisis, an international military conflict that took place during the Congo Crisis between 1960 and 1965 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Air Force is responsible for defending the Congo's airspace, conducting search and rescue operations, and providing transport for the members of the military. The Air Force operates a variety of aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters, and transport aircraft. It is currently operating a fleet of Sukhoi Su-30 and Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jets, as well as Mil Mi-17 and Eurocopter Fennec helicopters. The Air Force also operates transport aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules, C-47 Skytrain, and Antonov An-26. The FAC is composed of around 3,000 personnel, including pilots, aircrew, technicians, and support staff. The Air Force is commanded by the Chief of the Air Staff, appointed by the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The FAC has a number of bases located across the country, including Kamina Air Base and Kinshasa Air Base. The Air Force also has an active role in peacekeeping operations within and outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has provided transport for United Nations forces, as well as medical evacuation and air support during the various conflicts in the region. In 2020, the Air Force deployed personnel to the Central African Republic as part of a United Nations mission to bring stability to the country. The Air Force has engaged in a number of training exercises with foreign nations in the past few years. In 2014, the FAC launched a joint exercise with the Cameroon Air Force, which included simulated air-to-air combat and air intercept exercises. In 2017, the FAC took part in a series of exercises with the Rwandese Air Force, which focused on air defense and combat tactics. The Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo serves as an important branch of the Congolese Armed Forces, providing air power and vital transport capability to the country. The Air Force plays an active role in peacekeeping operations in the region and has engaged in several joint training exercises with foreign nations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16732356}

The Texans' attempt to make history as the first team to play the Super Bowl on their home field, NRG Stadium, was thwarted in the second round of the 2016-17 NFL playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.\n\nThe Texans finished 9–7 for the third season in a row and clinched the AFC South for the second season in a row, winning their fourth overall division title; the Texans finished tied with the Tennessee Titans, but won the tiebreaker based on record against division opponents. The 2016 season marked the first time in franchise history that the Texans swept the Indianapolis Colts. This marks the second time in team history that the Texans made the playoffs in back to back years, and the first since 2011–12. This was also the first time in their franchise history where their defense ranked number one in the league, despite losing their injured star defensive end J. J. Watt for most of the season, only allowing 20.5 points per game and only 301.3 yards per game.\n\nThe Texans defeated the Oakland Raiders 27–14 in the Wild Card round and advanced to the Divisional Round for the first time since the 2012 season, but they lost to the New England Patriots 34–16.\n\nDraft\n\nNotes\n The Texans traded their sixth-round selection and wide receiver Keshawn Martin to the New England Patriots in exchange for the Patriots' fifth-round selection.\n The Texans made multiple trades within the seventh round:\n Acquiring a conditional seventh-round selection in a trade that sent quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to the New York Jets; this selection was upgraded to a sixth-rounder after Fitzpatrick played more than 70% of the Jets snaps in ;\n Acquiring an additional seventh-round selection in a trade that sent quarterback Case Keenum to the St. Louis Rams (now Los Angeles Rams);\n Trading a seventh-round selection to the Denver Broncos in exchange for offensive tackle Chris Clark;\n Trading a seventh-round selection to the New England Patriots in exchange for quarterback Ryan Mallett.\n Exact numbers of the selections from rounds 4–7 were determined when compensatory selections were awarded on March 11.\n\nStaff\n\nFinal roster\n\nSchedule\n\nPreseason\n\nRegular season\n\nNote: Intra-division opponents are in bold text.\n\nPostseason\n\nGame summaries\n\nRegular season\n\nWeek 1: vs. Chicago Bears\n\nBrock Osweiler started his first regular season game for the Texans at home against the Chicago Bears. Houston received the ball first and made it all the way to the Chicago 34 before an Osweiler pass was intercepted by Tracy Porter. The Bears capitalized on the turnover with a 1-yard run from Jeremy Langford. In the 2nd quarter, Jay Cutler fumbled the ball on 4th and 1 at the Houston 31. Cutler recovered the fumble but the drive was turned over on downs. Houston scored on the following drive with a 28-yard field goal from Nick Novak. Following a slow offensive start in the first half, Houston trailed Chicago 10–14 at halftime. Momentum shifted in the 2nd half in favor of the Texans, outscoring the Bears 13–0. With the win, Houston improved to 4–0 all time against Chicago.\n\nWeek 2: vs. Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Texans stayed at home for week 2 where they hosted the Kansas City Chiefs, going 0–2 against the Chiefs the previous season, including a 30–0 shutout loss in the Wild Card round. Houston's defense managed Kansas City's offense, holding the Chiefs to only 4 Cairo Santos field goals. The only touchdown of the game came on a 27-yard pass from Brock Osweiler to DeAndre Hopkins in the 1st quarter.\n\nWeek 3: at New England Patriots\n\nThe Houston Texans fell to the New England Patriots 27–0, dropping to 2–1 for the season. Problems started early for the Texans as Charles James fumbled a kick return that was recovered by Duron Harmon at the Houston 22. The fumble lead to a Jacoby Brissett 27-yard run to extended New England's lead to 10–0 following Stephen Gostkowski's kick late in the first quarter. On the Texans' next possession, a Brock Osweiler pass was intercepted by Jamie Collins. The Patriots gained the ball to start the second half and settled for a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyler Ervin fumbled the ball with Jordan Richards recovering it. Like before, the fumble resulted in a New England touchdown with a 1-yard LeGarrette Blount run. The loss was Houston's first shutout loss since December 7, 2003, where the Texans fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars also by a score of 27–0. It was also head coach Bill O'Brien's first return to New England in 5 years, where he served as an offensive assistant in their undefeated regular season of 2007, as wide receivers coach in 2008, quarterbacks coach from 2009–10, and as offensive coordinator in 2011. O'Brien was also part of two AFC-winning Patriots teams in 2007 and 2011, losing the Super Bowl to the Eli Manning-led New York Giants on both occasions.\n\nDays after the game, defensive end J. J. Watt underwent back surgery to repair a herniated disk. Watt missed the remainder of the 2016 season due to the surgery. Former Texan Antonio Smith was signed to the team to replace Watt for the season.\n\nWeek 4: vs. Tennessee Titans\n\nWill Fuller's 67-yard punt return TD late in the third quarter helped the Texans defeat the Titans 27-20. With the victory, the Texans improved to 3-1. Houston also defeated Tennessee for the fifth straight time. The victory is the Texans' 100th overall win in franchise history.\n\nWeek 5: at Minnesota Vikings\n\nWith the loss, the Texans fell to 3-2 and have yet to defeat the Vikings in franchise history.\n\nWeek 6: vs. Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Texans hosted their divisional rivals, the Colts, in a prime time match up. Houston's offense got off to a slow start during the first half with the crowd booing quarterback Brock Osweiler numerous times. While the offense was struggling, Houston's defense kept them in the game to only trail 3–13 at halftime. The Texans' offense scored their first touchdown of the game midway through the third quarter with a 1-yard run from Lamar Miller. Miller's rushing touchdown was his first of the season and Houston's first rushing touchdown of the season. After Miller's touchdown run, Nick Novak missed the extra point, going wide right, to trail 9–13. The Texans' offense faltered again while the Colts started to pull away in the fourth quarter to lead 23–9 with 7:04 left in regulation. Down by 14, the Texans refused to give up and started a comeback against the Colts. Houston tied the game with 0:47 left in regulation on a 26-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz. With Novak making the extra point, the game was tied at 23–23. Indianapolis tried to win the game in regulation, but were forced to punt with 0:23 left in the game. Houston took the knee to close out the fourth.\n\nThe Colts received the ball to begin overtime, but failed to make it out of their own territory. On 3rd and 3 Andrew Luck was sacked by Benardrick McKinney for a 9-yard loss and Indianapolis was forced to punt the ball away. Houston made it into field goal territory after Osweiler found Jaelen Strong for a 36-yard pass at the Indianapolis 12-yard line. On the next play, Osweiler intentionally ran for a 3-yard loss to help set up a Novak field goal. After Osweiler's set up, Novak made the 33-yard field goal to win the game for the Texans, 26–23.\n\nWith the win, Houston went to 4–2 on the season, 4–0 at home, and extended their win streak over Indianapolis to a franchise best 2 games.\n\nWeek 7: at Denver Broncos\n\nIn a MNF matchup, Brock Osweiler returned to Denver for the first time after leaving the Broncos in the offseason. But his success last week wasn't enough this week as the Broncos held the Texans to three field goals for the win. With the loss, the Texans fell to 4–3.\n\nWeek 8: vs. Detroit Lions\n\nThe Texans rebounded from their dismal Monday Night performance and never trailed in their first matchup against the Detroit Lions since Houston's Thanksgiving 2012 win in OT. With the win, the Texans entered the Week 9 bye at 5-3.\n\nWeek 10: at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThe Texans got their first road win of the season and their first winning streak since Weeks 1–2, improving to 6–3.\n\nWeek 11: at Oakland Raiders\nNFL International Series\n\nFollowing their first road win of the season the previous week, the Texans traveled to Mexico City to face the Oakland Raiders in what would be a controversial game. Houston received the opening kickoff and Brock Osweiler found DeAndre Hopkins for a 60-yard touchdown pass and run, but Hopkins was ruled out of bounds after gaining 24 yards. The instant replay showed that Hopkins stayed in bounds, but the play could not be challenged due to an NFL rule that says a play where a player is ruled out of bounds cannot be challenged. After the officiating error, the Texans' opening drive ended in a 32-yard field goal from Nick Novak. In the 4th quarter, with the game tied 20–20, the Texans made it to the Raiders' 16-yard line. On 3rd and 2, Lamar Miller ran the ball and appeared to have gained the 1st down, but was ruled just short. On 4th and inches, Houston decided to go for it and handed the ball off to Akeem Hunt. Hunt also appeared to have gained the 1st down, but was ruled short. The play was challenged, but the call was upheld. The spot of the ball on both plays was heavily criticized as both Miller and Hunt appeared to have gained enough yards for a 1st down. On the ensuing drive, Oakland would score the game-winning touchdown with a 35-yard pass from Derek Carr to Amari Cooper.\n\nAlong the controversial officiating, a fan in the stands shined a laser pointer in the eyes of Osweiler and Miller throughout the game.\n\nWeek 12: vs. San Diego Chargers\n\nThe Texans fell to the Chargers 21–13, losing their first and only home game of the season and dropping to 6–5.\n\nWeek 13: at Green Bay Packers\n\nHouston lost for the first time in Green Bay, falling to .500 and 6-6.\n\nWeek 14: at Indianapolis Colts\n\nWith the win, the Texans moved up to 7–6 and swept the Colts for the first time in franchise history. They also snapped their three-game losing streak.\n\nWeek 15: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThe Texans were down 13-5 at halftime and had a deficit as large as 20-8, but ultimately rallied to win 21-20. With the comeback win, the Texans improved to 8-6 and extended their divisional winning streak to 10 games, and six straight against Jacksonville.\n\nNotes\nQuarterback Brock Osweiler was pulled from the game and benched in favor of Tom Savage during the second quarter. Osweiler went 6/11 for 48 yards and threw two back-to-back interceptions before being pulled from the game in the middle of the second quarter.\n\nWeek 16: vs. Cincinnati Bengals\n\nQuarterback Tom Savage got his first career NFL start against the Cincinnati Bengals. Savage struggled in the first half against the Bengals' stout defense, being sacked on two back-to-back plays in the first quarter for a huge loss. The first score of the game came on a last second 43–yard field goal from Randy Bullock to put Cincinnati up 3–0 going into halftime. The Texans responded on their first possession in the second half with a 25–yard field goal from Nick Novak to tie the game at 3–3. The Bengals punted the ball on their next possession. Receiving the ball back, another drive stalled for the Texans as they had to settle for a 22–yard field goal from Novak to take a 6–3 lead. Cincinnati tried to respond to the Houston field goal, but a tipped pass from Andy Dalton was intercepted by Quentin Demps. The Texans came up short on the interception and were forced to punt the ball back. After receiving the kick, the Bengals quickly struck with Dalton finding Brandon LaFell for an 86–yard touchdown pass. With Bullock making the extra point the Bengals took a 10–6 lead with 10:45 left to play. Houston responded on their next drive with a 24–yard touchdown run from Alfred Blue, but Novak's extra point was blocked. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals marched down to the Houston 25–yard line to try the game-winning field goal. Cincinnati kicker Randy Bullock, who had been released by the Texans the previous season, tried for the game-winning field goal, but it went wide right.\n\nWith the win and the Tennessee Titans losing earlier in the day, the Texans won their second straight AFC South title.\n\nWeek 17: at Tennessee Titans\n\nTom Savage started at quarterback for the Texans, but was pulled from the game in the 1st quarter due to a possible concussion. After Savage was pulled, Brock Osweiler, who had been benched 2 weeks prior, came in as quarterback.\n\nWith the loss, the Texans finished the regular season at 9-7 for the third straight year. Their ten-game winning streak against divisional opponents was snapped, as well as their five-game winning streak against the Titans.\n\nPostseason\n\nAFC Wild Card Playoffs: vs. (5) Oakland Raiders\n\nIn a rematch of a controversial game from week 11, the Houston Texans hosted the Oakland Raiders for the first playoff game of the 2016 season.\n\nBrock Osweiler started as the Texans' quarterback with Tom Savage still out due to concussion protocol. On the other side of the field, Oakland Raiders quarterback Connor Cook started his first-ever NFL game, which also happened to be in the postseason, becoming the first rookie in NFL history since the inception of the Super Bowl to do so. With eight minutes remaining in the first quarter, the Texans drew first blood with a 50-yard Nick Novak field goal, and a handoff from Texans QB Brock Osweiler to Lamar Miller touchdown and Novak PAT soon made the game 10–0. A 37-yard punt return on a 51-yard punt from Shane Lechler by Jalen Richard gave the Raiders good field position for a Latavius Murray rushing touchdown to bring the Raiders back into the game at 10–7 after a Sebastian Janikowski PAT. The Texans and then the Raiders exchanged three-and-outs, setting the scene for a coffin corner punt by Marquette King that pinned the Texans at their own five-yard line. However, the Texans recovered and scored again on a narrowly good Novak 38-yard field goal. A subsequent DeAndre Hopkins touchdown reception further widened their lead to 20–7 at the half. Neither team was able to put anything on the scoreboard in the third quarter. However, with 12:28 left to go in the fourth quarter, Brock Osweiler went untouched for a 1-yard rushing touchdown, making the score 27–7. The Raiders rallied back with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Cook to Andre Holmes, but that would be the last score of the game as Connor Cook's next drive was abruptly halted after a tipped-ball interception by Texans cornerback A. J. Bouye sealed the Raiders' fate. The final score was 27–14 to the Texans.\n\nAFC Divisional Playoffs: at (1) New England Patriots\n\nWith this loss, the Texans become the latest victim of the Super Bowl home field curse, as no host team had ever played the championship game on its own home field (with the previous week's victory, they had already become only the third Super Bowl host team - and the first other than the Miami Dolphins - to win a playoff game). They finish with an overall record of 10-8.\n\nStandings\n\nDivision\n\nConference\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nHouston\nHouston Texans seasons\nHouston Texans\nAFC South championship seasons", "machine_text": " The 2016 Houston Texans season was the franchise's 15th season in the National Football League (NFL) and the fourth under head coach Bill O'Brien. It was also the first season under new general manager Brian Gaine. The Houston Texans began the season on a four-game winning streak and in first-place in the AFC South, their first division lead since 2012. However, their record eventually fell to 9‐7, missing the playoffs. Houston achieved several milestones during the 2016 season. They became the first NFL team in history to start a season 4–0 after four consecutive 9–7 seasons. On November 21, 2016, quarterback Brock Osweiler made history when he became the first quarterback in NFL history to have four wins in his first four starts. Offseason The 2016 offseason saw the Texans make several changes to their roster and staff. Ownership hired Brian Gaine as their new general manager and Jack Easterby as their new executive vice president of football operations. This was done in an effort to bolster the Texans' front office and ensure a collaborative effort between the scouting staff, coaches, and executives. The Texans also made several moves during free agency. They signed free-agent running back Lamar Miller and wide receiver Cecil Shorts, as well as safety Andre Hal, safety Quintin Demps, linebacker Bryan Braman, and offensive lineman Jeff Adams. The team also re-signed quarterback Brian Hoyer, offensive tackle Chris Clark, and outside linebacker John Simon. Regular season The Texans made it to their first division title in four years with a 9–7 record. They held a three‐game lead in the division heading into Week 15, but failed to clinch the division due to losses in their final two games. Brock Osweiler had an inconsistent year as the starting quarterback, passing for 15 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, and 2,957 yards. Lamar Miller had an impressive first season with the Texans, recording 1,073 yards and five touchdowns. The Texans passing attack was led by DeAndre Hopkins, who had 78 receptions for 954 yards and four touchdowns. The defense was led by J.J. Watt, who had 17.5 sacks and eight forced fumbles. Linebacker Whitney Mercilus had 12 sacks and two forced fumbles, and outside linebacker John Simon had six sacks and two forced fumbles. Cornerback Jonathan Joseph also had a solid season with 59 tackles, two interceptions and 16 passes defended. The Texans finished with a 9–7 record, missing out on a wild-card spot after the Raiders defeated the Broncos in Week 16. Postseason The Texans had a chance to make the playoffs in the final week of the season, but were eliminated after the Titans defeated the Jaguars in extra time. They finished the season with a 9–7 record and their first AFC South title since 2012. The Texans season ended with a 30–0 loss to the Chiefs in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. The game was the first playoff shutout in the NFL since 2013, when the Chargers shut out the Bengals. Roster changes The Texans made several changes to their roster in the 2016 offseason. They signed free agent defensive back Kareem Jackson and linebacker Clint Session, and traded for running back Lamar Miller. They also released veteran center Chris Myers and cut running backs Arian Foster and Andre Brown. Wide receiver Cecil Shorts, safety Andre Hal, safety Quintin Demps, and linebacker Bryan Braman were also added to the roster. The team also made changes to the coaching staff. Quarterbacks coach Pat O’Hara was fired, and associate head coach/offensive line coach John Benton, offensive coordinator George Godsey, and defensive backs coach Johnnie Lynn were all released. Several new coaches were hired, including quarterbacks coach Sean Ryan, offensive coordinator George Godsey, defensive backs coach Romeo Crennel, and defensive backs coach Anthony Midget. Prior to the start of the regular season, the Texans made two trades. They acquired tight end Ryan Griffin from the Saints and safety Rahim Moore from the Broncos, and traded fullback Jay Prosch to the Colts. The team also signed several free agents during the season, including quarterback Brandon Weeden, safety Don Jones, and linebacker Max Bullough. Off-season The Texans finished the 2016 season with an 9 and 7 record, however the team’s front office took action in the offseason and made major personnel changes. The coaches remained the same as before, however in the front office the Texans hired Brian Gaine as their new general manager and Jack Easterby as their new executive vice president of football operations. In free agency they signed wide receiver Cecil Shorts, safety Andre Hal, safety Quintin Demps, linebacker Bryan Braman, and offensive lineman Jeff Adams", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48447577}

The film stars Rasika Dugal, Vikas Kumar and Talha Arshad Reshi in major roles, and is an adaptation of the play Phone No. 786 by Mohd. Amin Bhat. The story revolves about a seven-year-old Hamid who learns that 786 is God's number and decides to try and reach out to God, by dialing this number. He wants to talk to his father, who his classmate tells him has gone to Allah. One fine day the phone call is answered, and two lives shattered in the strife of Kashmir find a way to be complete again. The film is produced by Yoodlee Films, a venture of Saregama. The official trailer was released on 10 October 2018. Global premiere of Hamid was held at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival. The film went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Urdu at the 66th National Film Awards hosted in August 2019.\n\nPlot \n\nHamid is a young boy of seven, in search of his father who went missing a year ago. He somehow discovers that 786 is Allah's number, makes some combination and finally dials a phone number which is answered. Thus begins a series of conversations with the person on the other line who happens to be a CRPF soldier finding solace in Hamid's innocent talk. Hamid tells him about his father, his teachings and how his absence has changed their lives. Meanwhile, Hamid's mother is not able to make peace with the fact that her husband has disappeared. She is always lost in her grief and is dejected. \nHamid tries to learn his father's boat-making craft among various other means to please Allah, in belief that his father might return some day. Finally on one of the days Hamid realizes that his father is dead and would never return. His mother comes to terms with his death on the very same day. In the epilogue it is shown that Hamid finally gets his much desired red paint for the newly deigned boat (probably sent by the CRPF jawan), paints it and sails on it with his mother.\n\nThe film denotes how eventually people learn to deal with tragedies and move on no matter what, and serves as a powerful depiction of human resilience. What is striking is also the fact that despite being naive the boy knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong due to his father's teachings, again stressing the fact that we are a result of our upbringing.\n\nCast\nTalha Arshad Reshi as Hamid\nVikas Kumar as Abhay \nRasika Dugal as Ishrat\nSumit Kaul as Rehmat\nMir Sarwar as Abbass\nBashir Lone as Rasool Chacha\nVeer Rajwant Singh as Rajinder\nAshraf Nagoo as Basheer\nQazi Faiz as Beggar\nUmar Adil as Police Officer\nGulam Hussain Barji as Shopkeeper\nSajid as Police Constable\nShafia as Noor\n\nMarketing and release\nThe theatrical release poster of the film was released on 11 February 2019 giving the release date as 1 March 2019.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sir Hugo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sir Hugo (1889–1910) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career that lasted from 1891 to 1894 he ran eight times and won three races. As a three-year-old in 1892 he won The Derby at odds of 40/1. He was a consistent performer in top class races, but certainly inferior to his contemporaries Orme and La Fleche.\n\nBackground\nSir Hugo was a big, \"very-finely made\" chestnut horse with a white blaze, bred by his owner Orlando Bridgeman, 3rd Earl of Bradford. The colt was sent to the Earl’s private establishment at  Weston Park in Shropshire where he was trained by Tom Wadlow.\n \nSir Hugo’s sire Wisdom, who died in 1893, was a failure as a racehorse but became a highly successful stallion, siring good horses such as Love Wisely (Ascot Gold Cup), La Sagesse and Surefoot (2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes). His dam Manoeuvre was a good stayer who was placed in the St Leger. Apart from Sir Hugo, the best of her progeny was the mare Flying Column, a leading steeplechaser.\n\nRacing career\n\n1891: two-year-old season\nSir Hugo was a successful two-year-old, winning two of his five starts. He made his first appearance at Ascot where he finished third to Polyglot and St Damien in a Triennial Stakes. On 30 July Sir Hugo ran in a Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood in which he started the 2/1 favourite in a field of five and won “cleverly” by two lengths from Kyle\n\nIn September Sir Hugo was sent to Doncaster for the Champagne Stakes. He started at 9/1 and finished third of the five runners behind the outstanding filly La Fleche. In October he won the Boscawen Stakes at Newmarket, beating \"nothing of note\". Two weeks later Sir Hugo contested the year’s most important two-year-old race, the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at the same course. He was not strongly fancied and finished fifth of the ten runners behind the odds-on favourite Orme.\n\nSir Hugo was not considered a serious contender for the following season's Classics\n\n1892: three-year-old season\nSir Hugo began his three-year-old season on 4 May by running in the 2000 Guineas, a race which was considered very open after the withdrawal of the favourite Orme. He raced prominently, showing in third place at one stage, before finishing sixth of the fourteen runners behind Bona Vista\n\nIn the Derby on 1 June at Epsom Sir Hugo started at odds of 40/1 in a field of thirteen with La Fleche, who had won the 1000 Guineas being made the 11/10 favourite. He was ridden by the lightweight jockey Fred Allsopp, who had to carry more than 28 pounds of \"dead weight\" to make the stipulated 126 pounds. The weather was \"gloriously fine\" and the crowd was larger than usual. After several false starts which delayed the race by half an hour, the early running was made by Thessalian and Persistive with Sir Hugo just behind the leaders. The French-trained colt Bucentaur took the lead turning into the straight. Sir Hugo moved past Bucentaur a furlong from the finish and was strongly challenged by La Fleche. Cheered on by the bookmakers, Sir Hugo prevailed by three quarters of a length from the filly after a \"desperate struggle\", with Bucentaur a length further back in third Lord Bradford received £7,000 in prize money, but far more in winning bets, having backed Sir Hugo for the race at 100/1 before he ever ran. There were many observers who considered Sir Hugo's win to have been a \"fluke\". George Barrett, the rider of La Fleche, was criticised for giving the filly too much ground to make up while others drew attention to a collision between St. Angelo and Rueil at Tattenham corner which ended both colts' chances.\n\nSir Hugo was then sent to Royal Ascot where he started 4/6 favourite for the St. James's Palace Stakes over one mile. He led into the straight but was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished third behind St Angelo, who won easily by three quarters of a length, and Watercress.\n\nSir Hugo returned on 7 September for the St Leger at Doncaster. He was third choice in the betting behind Orme, who had returned from training problems (he had allegedly been poisoned) to win the Eclipse Stakes and La Fleche, who had won the Oaks two days after her defeat in the Derby. On a wet day in front of a huge crowd, Sir Hugo broke quickly but was then held up as Orme made the early running. Orme was a beaten horse by the time the field turned into the straight when La Fleche went into the lead. Sir Hugo produced a strong finish and ran on in \"dogged fashion\" to prove the best of the colts but could never get on terms with the filly and finished second, beaten two lengths, with Orme well beaten in fifth.\n\nOn 27 September Sir Hugo again challenged La Fleche in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse, but was never a threat and finished fifth of the eleven runners At Newmarket on 11 October he produced an excellent performance in defeat in the ten furlong Lowther Stakes, losing by a neck in a \"close set-to\" with El Diablo, to whom he was conceding fifteen pounds. In the Limekiln Stakes over one mile at the Newmarket Houghton meeting, Sir Hugo was provided with a pacemaker named Flank March, but the tactic failed as he was well beaten, finishing third to Orme and El Diablo.\n\n1893: four-year-old season\nSir Hugo was kept in training as a four-year-old and made his debut in a Biennial Stakes over two miles at Newmarket on 20 April. He made the running and after a brief challenge from Barrow, won \"in a canter\" by three lengths. Although the opposition was not strong, he was described as having won \"in the style of a good horse.\"\n\nHe did not stand up to further training and was retired in autumn. It was announced that he would go to stud with a fee of 150 guineas.\n\nAssessment and earnings\nThe general opinion of Sir Hugo during his career was that he had been a sub-standard, and rather fortunate Derby winner. At the end of his three-year-old season one commentator pointed out that although Sir Hugo lacked acceleration (\"that dash of speed\"), he had shown stamina, strength and an \"equable temper\", making him a good stallion prospect.\n\nSir Hugo's win prize money of £6,960 in 1892 placed him fourth on the list of highest earners behind La Fleche, Orme and the two-year-old Milford.\n\nStud career\nSir Hugo was not a success at stud. His best achievement was to sire the mare Ravello, who produced the 2000 Guineas winner Sweeper. His last known foals were conceived in 1906. Sir Hugo died in February 1910 at the Jockey Hall Stud in Curragh.\n\nPedigree\n\nSir Hugo's pedigree contains a notable amount of inbreeding. He was inbred 3 × 3 to Rataplan, meaning that this horse appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. Also in the third generation was Rataplan's full brother Stockwell. Sir Hugo was therefore inbred 4 × 4 × 4 to both The Baron and Pocahontas.\n\nReferences\n\n1889 racehorse births\n1910 racehorse deaths\nRacehorses trained in the United Kingdom\nRacehorses bred in the United Kingdom\nEpsom Derby winners\nThoroughbred family 19-b", "machine_text": " Sir Hugo was a beloved and respected English nobleman and politician of the 15th century, born in 1434. He was the son of Sir Robert and Lady Margaret of Cornwall, and was of noble lineage. His reputation was as one of the most powerful and influential political figures at the court of King Henry VI. After being educated at Oxford, he entered the world of politics and, in 1459, was appointed Sheriff of Cornwall. He quickly gained the favor of the king and became one of the most influential figures at the royal court. Through his influence, he was able to build powerful alliances of noble families and gain influence over the House of Commons. Sir Hugo was a loyal supporter to King Henry during the Wars of the Roses, and he helped to shape many of the political decisions at the court of the king. He was also involved in the negotiations of the Treaty of London and was instrumental in helping the king to have better mastery over the country. In 1466, he was knighted by the king and was made a baron by Henry VI. He rose to great popularity and was one of the most influential courtiers of the king. During his times, he was known as a good and just man and his influence was felt far and wide. Sir Hugo was a peaceful and prudent ruler. He often sought to resolve disputes between warring factions without further bloodshed. He was an advocate for commerce and foreign relations and strongly opposed the idea of tournaments and similar martial pursuits. One of his greatest accomplishments was the establishment of a peace and trade agreement between the English and French monarchs, an event that became known as the Treaty of London. In 1475, he was awarded the Order of the Garter for his services to the King and the country. Sir Hugo died in 1488 aged 54 after a long and distinguished career.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air-start system\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An air-start system is a power source used to provide the initial rotation to start large diesel and gas turbine engines.\n\nDiesel engines\n\nDirect starting\nCompared to a gasoline (petrol) engine, a Diesel engine has a very high compression ratio, an essential design feature, as it is the heat of compression that ignites the fuel. An electric starter with sufficient power to \"crank\" a large Diesel engine would itself be so large as to be impractical, thus the need for an alternative system.\n\nWhen starting the engine, compressed air is admitted to whichever cylinder has a piston just over top dead center, forcing it downward. As the engine starts to turn, the air-start valve on the next cylinder in line opens to continue the rotation. After several rotations, fuel is injected into the cylinders, the engine starts running and the air is cut off.\n\nTo further complicate matters, a large engine is usually \"blown over\" first with zero fuel settings and the indicator cocks open, to prove that the engine is clear of any water build up and that everything is free to turn. After a successful blow ahead and a blow astern, the indicator cocks are closed on all the cylinders, and then the engine can be started on fuel. Significant complexity is added to the engine by using an air-start system, as the cylinder head must have an extra valve in each cylinder to admit the air in for starting, plus the required control systems. This added complexity and cost limits the use of air-starters to very large and expensive reciprocating engines.\n\nStarter motor\nAnother method of air-starting an internal combustion engine is by using compressed air or gas to drive a fluid motor in place of an electric motor. They can be used to start engines from 5 to 320 liters in size and if more starting power is necessary two or more motors can be used. Starters of this type are used in place of electric motors because of their lighter weight and higher reliability. They can also outlast an electric starter by a factor of three and are easier to rebuild. Engines operating in underground mining activities tend to operate on this type of starter system to reduce the risk of an electrical system igniting flammable material.\n\nAll vane type air starters should have a lubricator installed to insure long-life and maximum performance. Lubricators give the moving parts a needed friction barrier, reduce metal corrosion and keep vanes sealed properly against the cylinder walls. Even the so-called lube-free air starters require lubrication to prolong trouble free life. Two basic lubricator devices are typically employed. One is an in-line or reservoir type that typically stores up to 2 quarts of lubricant, and is installed along the air supply line. The second style of lubricator is a small one shot device that dispenses a measured amount of lubricant every time the starter is engaged. Installed directly onto the air inlet of the starter, the in-line lubricators are self priming pneumatic pumps that require a 1/4″ lubrication line piped from as far away as 4 feet. Air Starter lubricators perform best using misting type, non-detergent oils such as diesel fuel or Marvel Mystery oil. If emissions are a concern, there are environmentally friendly type lubricants available on the market.\n\nNot all air starters require lubrication.  Turbine type air starters do not require air motor lubrication, although some turbine air starters do use an oil filled transmission that may require periodic inspections and maintenance.\n\nGas turbines\nAn air-starter or huffer on a turbine engine would typically consist of a radial inward flow turbine, or axial flow turbine, which is connected to the high pressure compressor spool through the accessory gearbox, plus the associated piping and valves. Compressed air is provided to the system by bleed air from the aircraft's auxiliary power unit or from an air compressor mounted on ground support equipment.\n\nAdvantages\nCompared with electric starters, air-starters have a higher power-to-weight ratio. Electric starters and their wiring can become excessively hot if it takes longer than expected to start the engine, while air-starters can run as long as their air supply lasts. Air-starters are much simpler and are compatible with turbine engines, and thus are used on many designs of large turbofan engine that are installed on commercial and military aircraft.\n\nSee also\n Air Start Unit\nAVPIN - A monofuel used to power turbojet starter motors.\nCoffman engine starter - A similar system which uses an explosive cartridge to supply gas pressure.\n\nReferences\n\nStarting systems", "machine_text": " An air-start system (also referred to as a jet-assist start or gas generator start) is an auxiliary power source systems used to provide the initial rotation (cranking) to start large stationary engines, such as those used in power generation and marine applications. Air-start systems consist of an air supply source (typically a compressor or bottle of compressed air), an air control valve, and a starting motor. Air-start systems are generally used for engines that are too large to be started using a traditional starter motor, or for those engine models which require a higher torque and/or slower speed to achieve successful starting. The system is composed of an air tank and a pressure switch, which when activated will provide a high-pressure air supply to the air-start motor. When the system is activated, the air pressure will actuate a valve to rapidly increase the speed of the starter motor, creating sufficient torque to engage the internal combustion engine. This increases the pressure in the crankcase which works to build up RPMs. Once the engine is running, the air pressure can then be released, and the air supply shut off, allowing the engine to continue running on its own. Air-start systems are often used in combination with diesel fuel injection systems, or with other fuel burning systems. As the pressure builds up in the crankcase, the fuel injectors will start to inject fuel into the engine's cylinders, providing a combustible mixture. Air-start systems are generally considered safer than traditional starter motors, as they do not require the use of high voltage electricity or combustible fuels. They are also quieter to operate, and can perform at higher temperatures than traditional starter motors. In addition to stationary engines, air-start systems are used in some types of aircraft, allowing for an easier starting process for the aircraft engines. In summary, the air-start system is an auxiliary power source used to provide the initial rotation (cranking) to start large stationary engines such as those used in power generation and marine applications. It is composed of an air supply source (compressor or bottle of compressed air), an air control valve, and a starting motor. Due its high safety, low power requirements, and performance in high temperatures, the air-start system is an efficient and popular auxiliary device.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194126}

Marlay was a noted speaker in the House of Commons and was an important figure during the debates leading up to the American Revolution. Marlay served two terms as a Member of Parliament for Droitwich. During his first term, Marlay was an advocate of taxation reform, which was unpopular with British Colonists in the American colonies. He famously argued for more equitable taxation between Britain and its colonies. When the American Revolution began in 1776, Marlay argued in favor of a peaceful settlement and proposed reforms to the Crown's relationship with its American colonies. However, his colleagues disagreed, and he refused to support war. As the war wore on, Marlay proposed several reforms to Parliament that sought to bring attention to the grievances of the colonists in an attempt to avert further violence. In 1782, he introduced the Peace of Conciliation Bill, a legislative resolution to the conflict, which was not accepted. Later that same year, he proposed a compromise to the impasse, but it was not approved by Parliament. Towards the end of his life, Marlay was appointed as the chairman of a committee to investigate the situation in the former colonies. He advocated for a lenient approach to reviving and restoring much of the original American government and the rights of the colonists. Marlay passed away in 1790, but his legacy remains to this day. He was an early adopter of the concept of a unified government supporting the rights of its citizens, which he saw as one of the most important qualities of a successful nation.

The artist's most popular motive was the Scottish highlands. Joel was a much respected artist during the Victorian and Edwardian era, valued especially for the vibrancy of his palette and 'flowing', 'sophisticated' brush strokes, yet was largely forgotten (and underestimated) in the late 20th and early 21st century.

Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate.

Construction started in 2013 and was completed in 2019. The tower is the second tallest building in Tianjin after Goldin Finance 117, eighth tallest building in the world, and the tallest building in the world with fewer than 100 floors. It is located in the outer district of the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area. Tianjin CTF Finance Center is designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP in collaboration with Ronald Lu & Partners.\n\nDesign\n\nThe building commonly designed as the softly curving glass skin integrates eight sloping mega-columns that follow a lyrical line connecting the centers and corners of all four elevations. These curving mega-columns increase the structure's response to seismic concerns and are integral to both the gravity and lateral systems. They are effective in increasing the stiffness of the building's perimeter frame, consequently attracting a larger portion of the seismic forces in compliance with the Chinese code requirements.\n\nThe façade reinforces the curvature of the tower form and creates a shimmering texture over the building's surface. The crystalline-like curtain wall stretches from the suspended glass canopies at each of the lobbies to the dematerialized, mega-column-looped crown and presents a bold expression of a comprehensive, integrated design on the Tianjin skyline.\n\nFeatures\n\nBy stacking reducing floor plates, the tower tapers dramatically to minimize the surface area exposed to wind, sun, and moisture. The gently-undulating curves of the facade subtly denote the integration of the three distinct programs within a singular smooth object. Square in plan with rounded corners, the floor plate geometry enables unique interior fit-outs and customization options for occupants. Research by the architect has shown that lateral forces due to vortex shedding can be controlled by tapering the vertical profile of the tower and softening any sharp corners in plan. The building's aerodynamic shape greatly reduces this vortex shedding by “confusing the wind” and disrupting the opportunity for any resonating wind forces and loads on the structure.\n\nConstruction process \nOn November 20, 2009, Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center held a groundbreaking ceremony.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ranjana script\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Rañjanā script (Lantsa) is an abugida writing system which developed in the 11th century and until the mid-20th century was used in an area from Nepal to Tibet by the Newar people, the historic inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley, to write Sanskrit and Nepalbhasa. Nowadays it is also used in Buddhist monasteries in India; China, especially in the Tibetan Buddhist areas within the Tibet Autonomous Region, Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai and Gansu; Mongolia, and Japan. It is normally written from left to right but the Kutakshar form is written from top to bottom. It is also considered to be the standard Nepali calligraphic script.\n\nDevelopment\nRañjanā is a Brahmic script which developed around 1100 CE. It is used in India and in Nepal by the Newar people to write the Newar language. The script is also used in most of the Mahayana and Vajrayana monasteries. Along with the Prachalit Nepal alphabet, it is considered one of the scripts of Nepal. It is the formal script of Nepal duly registered in the United Nation while applying for the free Nation. Therefore, it is a vital script to all Nepalese as well.\n\nThe Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra lettered in gold ink by Bhiksu Ananda of Kapitanagar and dating back to the Nepal Sambat year 345 (1215 CE) is an early example of the script.\n\nAlphabet\n\nVowels\n\nConsonants\n\nVowel diacritics\n\nThe shape of the combining marks indicating the vowels आ ā, ए e, ऐ ai/ē,ओ o, and औ au/ō  in Ranjana script take a different form when combined with the eight consonants  ख kha, ग ga, n ञ nya, ठ ṭha ण ṇa, थ tha, ध dha or श sha(or where one of these is the first consonant in a combination) (In addition the vertical marks indicating  आ ā or ī may take a shorter form when combined with the consonants क ka, ज्ञ ja, or ठ ṭha.)\n\nNumerals\n\nUse\n\nRañjana is mostly used for printing Hindu and Buddhist scriptures and literature in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit used by the Newar community. Rañjana is also in current use for printing “high status” documents (wedding invitations, certificates, etc) in Nepal in the Newar language and for Newar language book titles. In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions, it is famously used to write various mantras including the \"Om mani padme hum\" mantra of Avalokiteśvara, the mantra of Tara: \"Om tare tuttare ture svaha\", and the mantra of Manjusri: \"Om a ra pa ca na dhi.\" The script is also used in Hindu scriptures.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism and other East Asian Buddhism, the standard Sanskrit script for mantras and dhāraṇīs was not the Rañjanā script, but rather the earlier Siddhaṃ script that was widely propagated in China during the Tang dynasty. However, in late Imperial China, the influence of Tibetan Buddhism popularized the Rañjanā script as well, and so this script is also found throughout East Asia, but is not as common as Siddhaṃ. In Vietnam, Rañjanā script is often used during Buddhist rituals especially by monks in the central region such as Huế. Talismans are often made using Rañjanā mantras read \"Om mani padme hum\" or \"Om cale cule cundi svaha\"  the mantra of Cundi Bodhisattva. The script has also been adopted by Vietnamese folk shamans in their use of amulets such as Lỗ Ban phái, a Taoist folk sect that arrived from China named after Lu Ban, patron god of carpenters.\n\nUse in Tibet \n\nWhen Rañjanā was introduced to Tibet, it was referred to as Lanydza (), which simply derives from the Sanskrit word Rañja. This script varies slightly from the standard Rañjanā. In Tibet, the Lanydza variant is used to write original texts of Sanskrit. Examples of such texts include the Mañjuśrīnāmasamgīti, the Diamond Sutra and the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra. The Lanydza script is also found in manuscripts and printed editions of some Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicons like the Mahāvyutpatti.\n\nHowever, the most frequent use for this script today is on the title pages of Tibetan texts, where the Sanskrit title is often written in Lanydza, followed by a transliteration and translation in the Tibetan script. The script is also used decoratively on temple walls, on the outside of prayer wheels, and in the drawing of mandalas.\n\nNumerous alternative spellings of the term Lanydza exist, including the following:\n Lanja\n Landzha\n Lantsa\n Lantsha\n Lentsa\n Lendza\n\nMonogram (Kutākshar)\n\nKutākshar is a monogram of the Ranjana script. It is only one of the Nepalese scripts that can be written in monogram.\n\nSince 20th century in modern Nepal\n\nAfter falling into disuse in the mid-20th century, the script has recently seen dramatically increased use. It is used by many local governments such as those of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City, Bhaktapur Municipality, Thimi Municipality, Kirtipur Municipality, Banepa Municipality, in signboards, letter pads, and such. Regular programs are held in the Kathmandu Valley to promote the script and training classes are held to preserve the language. The script is being endorsed by the Nepal Bhasa movement and is used for headings in newspapers and websites.\n\nA Nepalese-German project is trying to conserve the manuscripts of Rañjanā script.\n\nA Unicode block for the script has also been proposed by Evertype.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDownload Ranjana Newari Regular Font\n\nFynn, Christopher John.

It was the official script of Nepal during the Malla dynasty and remains in use to the present day for writing Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit. The Ranjana script is believed to have been derived from the Siddham script and Proto-Bengali script. As evident from scattered inscriptions unearthed in Nepal, the script appeared in the 10th century C.E. and quickly replaced several other scripts used in Nepal at the time, such as the Pranava or Sarada script. The script is written from left to right, with horizontal lines extending across the page. Each line has a maximum of five characters and each character consists of either one or two syllables. Upto 22 vowel markers are used to represent the vowels and each consonant is represented by a single syllable. The script uses various ligature styles, such as writing the vowels on top of the characters to represent the consonants. In Nepal, Ranjana is used as a decorative script for religious purposes. It is used for traditional manjusa, a head ornament worn by women, and Newari jewellery. The script is also used for writing in palm-leaves for books, and for generating the Tibetan-style thangkas which are the religious scroll paintings of Nepal. Ranjana is primarily used in the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding areas of Central and Eastern Nepal, as well as other parts of the country. It is not commonly used in the western and mid-western Narayani, Lumbini, and Rapti zones. In recent years, an increased interest in the Ranjana script has led to the revival of the script. As part of this revival, efforts are being made to preserve the script and promote its use. The script was adopted as the official script of Nepal in 2018 and efforts are underway to have it recognized by the United Nations. As of 2019, there are over 25 recognized Ranjana script groups in Nepal, with a significant increase in the number of individuals who can read and write in the script. There are also several online tutorials and apps available to help people learn the script. Ranjana remains an important part of Nepali culture and is still used today to preserve the culture and traditions of Nepal.

Listed at , 168 lb., Harris batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nNicknamed \"Vicious Vic\", he was noted as one of the toughest players of his era in black baseball; Harris managed the Grays to first place in the Negro National League eight times (most for any manager in the Negro leagues) along with a Negro World Series title while being named to the East-West All Star Game seven times.\n\nCareer\nA native of Pensacola, Florida, Harris was the brother of fellow Negro leaguer Neal Harris. He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1914 and played baseball at the local YMCA. Harris started his professional career shortly after his 18th birthday, playing two games for the Pittsburgh Keystones in 1922 before moving to the Cleveland Tate Stars in 1923 and the Cleveland Browns in 1924, before start a long association with the Homestead Grays in 1925 which lasted 23 years. At this time, Homestead were not a member of any established league as the team rarely played other top black squads in those years and so statistics are limited, but when the Grays did, they often showed themselves to be a superior team.\n\nWhen Homestead joined the Eastern Colored League in 1928, Harris hit an anemic .204 average before the league folded, but he improved significantly in 1929, batting .350 in the high-offense American Negro League. In 1933 he hit .321 with Homestead, and .384 for the 1934 Pittsburgh Crawfords. The 1935 season brought Harris back to Homestead. He hit .342, as his eight home runs tied for fifth in the league and were even with Hall of Fame slugger Turkey Stearnes. A year later, he hit .315. In 1938, when Homestead dominated the league and won the first half with an .813 winning percentage, Harris led his team with a .380 batting average.\n\nHarris managed the Grays during their years in league play, between 1935 and 1948, and piloted Homestead to eight pennants. He guided his team to six consecutive first-place finishes from 1937 through 1942 (with five pennants). He took a job with a defense plant after the 1942 season, for which he would play for the Grays when he could do so while Candy Jim Taylor stepped in to manage the team for the next two seasons (each resulted in Negro World Series championships); Harris went 4-for-28 in the 1943 Negro World Series while not playing in the latter.\n\nHe also played in six East-West All-Star games between 1933 and 1947, and managed the East team eight times, four more than Oscar Charleston, the next-most-frequent manager. He won the last held Negro World Series in 1948 as the Grays left the league not long after.\n\nIn the waning days of the Negro leagues, Harris coached for the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants and managed the 1950 Birmingham Black Barons. Additionally, he played winter baseball in the Cuban League and managed Santurce in the Puerto Rican League from 1947 to 1950.\n\nAvailable statistics indicate that Harris hit .305 (733-for-2,406), and his teams posted a 547–278–2 mark in organized league play (with undoubtedly a higher total if one takes independent play into account) and a 10–15 mark during post-season play. An excellent motivator, he was well liked and respected by his players.\n\nPost-career and death\nAfter post-integration, he served as coach of the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants, he took one last managerial job with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1950 before he retired. He became the head custodian for the Castaic Union Schools in Castaic, California. He died at the age of 72 in San Fernando, California from the after-effects of surgery for treatment of cancer. He was survived by his wife Dorothy and two children in Judith and Ronald.\n\nLegacy\nHarris has the most league pennants of any manager in Negro league baseball with seven. Just five other managers in baseball history have won seven pennants. Despite this, he has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was considered in the 2006 Hall of Fame balloting, but he was not selected. On November 5, 2021, he was selected to the final ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame's Early Days Committee for consideration in the Class of 2022.

The Norfolk was the second submarine of the 37-boat Los Angeles class equipped to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles, and the first to deploy them operationally. The boat was fitted with an A-6 Intruder to act as a target for evaluation of anti submarine warfare instruments and sensors in a realistic environment. USS Norfolk saw her first deployment to the Mediterranean in 1987. During this assignment, the sub participated in Operation Earnest Will, operating in the more dangerous Persian Gulf. This marked the first time since World War II that a navy sub operated in those waters. The Norfolk also cruised briefly off the coast of Libya in a show of force. The submarine visited various ports, including: Taormina, Italy; Antalya, Turkey; Beirut, Lebanon; and Soudha Bay, Greece. In 1989, the Norfolk was deployed to the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. During this assignment, the sub participated in an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise with the United Kingdom and France. This exercise greatly increased coordination with allied forces in ASW warfare; the Norfolk returned to Norfolk, Virginia in August 1989.

They include Tarcoola, Kingoonyah, Pimba and the McDouall Peak as well as modern townships of Roxby Downs and Woomera. The lands extend west as far as Ooldea and the Ooldea Range while the northern frontier runs up to the Stuart Range and Lake Phillipson.

Indiana voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. Indiana has 11 electoral votes in the Electoral College.\n\nIndiana was the home state of Pence, who served as Governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017. Pence retained a 59% approval among voters in his home state.\n\nOn the day of the election, most news organizations considered Indiana a state Trump would win, or a red state. Trump won Indiana by 57% to Biden's 41%, a slight increase in his vote share from 2016, but with a reduction in his margin of victory. This election marked the first time since 1952 and only the third time since 1888 that Vigo County, home to Terre Haute and a significant bellwether county, voted for the losing candidate in a presidential election. Biden subsequently became the first presidential nominee of either party since 1952, and the first Democrat since 1884, to win without carrying Vigo County. Biden also became the first Democrat since 1944 to win without carrying traditionally Democratic Perry County in Southern Indiana. Biden did flip Tippecanoe County, home to Lafayette, from Republican to Democratic. Trump also became the first Republican since 1984 to carry exurban Madison County with more than 60% of the vote. This is also the first election since 1992 in which Indiana voted to the right of Kansas.\n\nNotably, Biden reduced the Republican margin in Hamilton County, a suburban county in the Indianapolis metropolitan area that is the state's fourth-most populous county. Hamilton County has never supported a candidate of the Democratic Party for president except for 1912, when the split in the Republicans allowed Woodrow Wilson to carry the county with a 34.9% plurality. Hamilton broke 60%-38% for John McCain in 2008, when Barack Obama won Indiana. Mitt Romney won Hamilton County 66%-32% in 2012 and Trump won it 56%-37% in 2016, nearly identical to his statewide margin. In this election, Trump narrowly won Hamilton County, 52%-45%, a margin that is to the left of the statewide result. Biden's 45% vote share in Hamilton County is higher than that of even Lyndon B. Johnson in his nationwide landslide in 1964 and higher than that of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.

Indiana is a red state and has voted for the Republican candidate in state elections since 2008, except for the 2008 presidential election when Barack Obama won the state’s 11 electoral votes. Donald Trump easily won the state in the 2016 election garnering 57% of the vote compared to Hillary Clinton’s 38% of the vote. Despite Trump’s dominance in the state a number of polls leading up to the election had the race a virtual tie. Real Clear Politics showed Trump ahead in all polls until the week of the election first by as much as 6% to less than 1%. On election day, November 3, as most of the in-person voting ended, Donald Trump won Indiana's 11 electoral votes despite the polls leading up to the election. Trump won 54.3% of the vote compared to Joe Biden's 43.8%, utilizing a rural advantage. Biden made a slight improvement in the cities and suburbs in comparison to Hillary Clinton in 2016 boosting his statewide vote share from 37.9% to 43.8%, while Trump saw a slight dip from 57.2% in 2016 to 54.3% in 2020. Turnout was higher in the 2020 election in comparison to 2016, reaching 79.3% of eligible voters, up from 75.9% in the 2016 election. In the end, Biden's efforts to build on Obama's gains in the state, most notably in the cities and suburbs, was blocked by Trump's overwhelming rural vote total. Trump won every county in Indiana outside of Lake and Marion counties, with Marion going to Biden by less than half a point. These two counties were also the areas Biden gained the most votes from 2016. Overall, Biden's slight gains in the heavily populated counties were blocked by Trump's rural vote and the fact that Trump won all other counties, leading to his second and final victory in Indiana. The 2020 United States presidential election in Indiana was marked as another clear victory for the Republican Party in the state. Trump's win is the sixth victory in a row for the GOP in the presidential election, with the last Democratic challenger to win the state being Barack Obama in 2008.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59562120}

Sexto Sentindo sold more than 1 million copies, gaining diamond certification by Associação Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD).\n\nProduction and songs\nAfter a period full of international projects that were interrupted by a column problem, Xuxa began the year of 1994 decided that it would return to invest in the Brazilian public. The new program in Rede Globo gradually shaped itself and soon after, a new album began to be developed as well.\n\nXuxa's audience had been growing. Many of the children who accompanied her in the days of the Xou da Xuxa were already entering their adolescence and thus the need arose to produce a disc that could please all the age groups. In this way, Xuxa would continue conquering the children's public, but without leaving aside the public that consecrated it like Queen. The album features lyrics and more mature arrangements than previous releases. We have as an example the song \"Hey DJ\" in which the blonde bet on the funk from Rio that gained evidence in that period, already in \t\"Dança Nas Estrelas\" the romantic pop and \"Happy-py\" the bet on reggae sharing the vocals with Carlinhos Brown.\n\nAccording to the controversial book Sonho de Paquitas (Dream of Paquitas), released in 1995, Popcorn was recorded for a play that Xuxa would do that year. The idea of recording the song came by chance. In an interview at the time, the blonde told that it was during a chat in her house with her businesswoman of the time, Marlene Mattos and composers Álvaro Socci and Cláudio Matta, until she commented on the desire that was to eat popcorn and soon then returned from the kitchen with several pots full of popcorn. Half-embarrassed, the composers said they had written a song that talked about candy. Xuxa was curious, they showed the song and she decided to record.\n\nSexto Sentido was the first record to win a title that was not the same as a Xuxa program and the first to be developed without the intention of using the tracks as a soundtrack on TV. The explanation of the title is due to a curious fact. When the hostess recorded the song \"Sexto Sentido\", a fan told that she had dreamed she'd put that title on the album and found it interesting. It is worth remembering that throughout the process of selection of repertoire, Xuxa and his team choose the songs through intuition, another reason that made this name for the album.\n\nSexto Sentido was produced by Michael Sullivan, had Artistic Direction by Aramis Barros and Artistic coordination by Marlene Mattos and Xuxa, recorded at the Som Livre studios.\n\nRelease and reception\nSexto Sentido was released on August 20, 1994 in CD, cassette and LP formats, The album was also re-released on CD in 1996, 2001 and 2006.

The re-recording of \"É de Chocolate\" began to serve as the opening theme of the attraction and performed in the last block and \"Só Falta Você\" was performed shortly after the messages of Good Morning. Cry of War that was specially composed for the program, was the unique song to be sung in all the seasons of the Xuxa Park. In addition to the performances, were music videos of the songs \"Pipoca\", \"Hey DJ\", \"Sexto Sentido\", \"Dança da Bananeira\", \t\"Rir é o Melhor Remédio (Gargalhada)\" and \"Muito Prazer, Eu Existo\". Initially, all tracks on the disc would win music videos.\n\nThe second stage of disclosure begins on August 21, 1994, when Xuxa presents the album in the program Domingão do Faustão. 2 days later a show was performed at the Imperator house in Rio de Janeiro to present the album.\n\nIn September, Xuxa gave interviews to the main Brazilian radio stations and shortly thereafter performed a mini-tour in nightclubs in São Paulo to promote the album.

The album mixed Xuxa's Brazilian rhythms, rhythms and styles from Mexico, Colombia and Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Argentina. According to Xuxa, the idea of the album came from a script they wrote while filming the television series Querido Maestro in Mexico City.

To promorte the track, Xuxa recorded a Spanish version of the music video. \"Cambiaré Por Ti\" was released as the second single from the album in September 2000. It was an instant success in Latin America and Billboard. The track reached its peak position of #24 on Billboard's Latin Pop Airplay Songs chart. The album's third single, a Latin pop track of Xuxa's own written in Spanish titled \"Voy\", was released in December 2000. Overall, Xuxa's Sexto Sentido was well-received by both Latin and non-Latin listeners alike. The album sold over 400,000 copies in the United States and over 1 million copies worldwide.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Catahoula Parish, Louisiana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Catahoula Parish () is a parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,407. Its seat is Harrisonburg, on the Ouachita River. The parish was formed in 1808, shortly after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nCatahoula Parish was the home to many succeeding Native American groups in the thousands of years before European settlements began. Peoples of the Marksville culture, Troyville culture, Coles Creek culture and Plaquemine culture built villages and mound sites throughout the area. Notable examples include Peck Mounds, and the Troyville Earthworks. The Troyville Earthworks have components dating from 100 BCE to 700 CE during the Baytown to the Troyville-Coles Creek periods.\n\nIt once had the tallest mound in Louisiana at  in height; it was the second-tallest mound in North America (after Monk's Mound at Cahokia Mounds). This mound was destroyed to make way for the Jonesville bridge over the Black River.\n\nHistoric era\nThis area was settled primarily by migrants from the southern United States after the Louisiana Purchase, when the US acquired the vast, former French-claimed territory west of the Mississippi River. White migrants to north and central Louisiana were from the South, and were mainly of British descent and Protestant religions. They brought a new influence into Louisiana. Some also brought or purchased African-American slaves to work on larger plantations. Many of these were from the Upper South, which sold slaves through the domestic market. They brought their own cultural influences as well.\n\nThe parish was founded in 1808 and originally incorporated a very large area. As population increased in the region, new parishes were organized from the territory first included in Catahoula Parish. The parish was divided by the state in 1910, when La Salle Parish was formed from its old western section. As one of the new parishes organized during early United States settlement of this part of the state, it has had the third most boundary changes since that time. Only Natchitoches and Ouachita parishes have had more revisions of boundaries.\n\nAt the start of the American Civil War, James G. Taliaferro, who had been a judge in the parish and was a delegate to the Louisiana state secessionist convention from Catahoula Parish, argued strongly against leaving the American Union. Taliaferro \"denied the constitutional right [of a state] to leave the Union and painted a gloomy picture of economic chaos, blighted prosperity, staggering taxation and 'fatal prostration of Louisiana's interests under a southern Confederation,' and he could see no way ahead to prevent final anarchy and war. So 'radical' were the ideas of Taliaferro that the convention refused to print his protest in the pages of [its journal].\" He is buried along with his wife and many other membera of his family in Alexander Cemetery in Manifest, Louisiana.\n\nCatahoula dog\n\nCatahoula Parish lays claim to its namesake Catahoula Leopard dog breed. The Catahoula breed was owned by Colonel James \"Jim\" Bowie of the Alamo and his brother Rezin Bowie, both of Louisiana. During the early 1900s, Theodore Roosevelt used the Catahoula when hunting. Louisiana Governor Earl Kemp Long also collected these dogs.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the parish has a total area of , of which  is land and  (4.2%) is water.

Growing  tall, it is a very variable coniferous evergreen tree or shrub,\n\nGrowth\nThe leaves grow in two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 5–10 mm long, and adult scale-leaves 1.5–3 mm long. Mature trees usually continue to bear some juvenile foliage as well as adult, particularly on shaded shoots low in the crown. This species is often dioecious (either male or female plants), but some individual plants produce both sexes of flowers. The blue-black berry-like cones grow to 7–12 mm in diameter, have a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2–4 seeds; they mature in about 18 months. The male cones, 2–4 mm long, shed their pollen in early spring.\n\nCultivation and uses\nThis popular ornamental tree or shrub for gardens, parks, and in tough coastal conditions of hot sun and sandy fast-draining soils, has more than 100 named cultivars selected for various characteristics, such as yellow foliage (e.g. cvs. 'Aurea', 'Tremonia'), permanently juvenile foliage (e.g. cv. 'Shoosmith'), columnar crown shape (cv. 'Columnaris'), abundant cones (e.g. cv. 'Kaizuka'), etc. First popular in the United States in the Los Angeles gardens in Mediterranean style homes, and now commonly found along both the West and East Coast in beach and coastal areas.\n\nThe Chinese juniper is widely used in bonsai, both as individual plants, such as the 250-year-old \"Omiya tree\" in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens in the UK, and in groups, such as the well-known Goshin on display at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum at the US National Arboretum.

It is an evergreen coniferous shrub growing to 15 m (49 ft) tall or sometimes a tree to 25 m tall. It has distinctive gray-green, scaly bark and bright bluish-green foliage on the tips of the shoots, which are a source of color in winter. The female cones are highly ornamental, with bright blue and red berry-like fruits. Chinese juniper has been used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. In ancient times, it was regarded as a symbol of longevity and vitality. Today, it is still used to treat headaches and allergies, to reduce inflammation, and to treat joint pain, hypertension, and digestive disorders. It has also been used as an insect repellent, and to treat throat infections, skin ailments, and colds. It is an important component of the landscape in China and can be seen growing in parks, city squares, and gardens, as well as in forests and on mountain slopes. It is used in bonsai and as a specimen tree in many gardens, due to its attractive foliage and bright fruits. It is an important food plant for several species of birds, including the Japanese lark, Japanese waxwing, and Japanese pipit. The wood is used for carving and as a construction material. Chinese juniper is readily available in nurseries and can be grown in virtually any location, provided the soil is suitable and there is good drainage. It prefers full sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soil. It is relatively drought-tolerant and can be pruned to shape, although it does not respond well to hard pruning. Propagation is by cuttings or by dividing nursery-grown plants. While Chinese juniper may suffer from fungal diseases, it is overall quite disease-resistant. Chinese juniper is one of the most versatile plants available, and with its attractive evergreen foliage, can be used to create a striking landscape feature. It is easy to grow and care for, and can help to provide a burst of color in any garden or yard. With its varied traditional uses and its ornamental appeal, the Chinese juniper is an important addition to the cultural heritage of many countries.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1029596}

In a similar vein, she authored Cottage Dialogues in 1821, a book which depicted rural life for the pleasure and improvement of the lower classes. 1855 saw the publication of her First Prayer in Verse.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nShades of Character (3rd. ed) full text at Hathi Trust Digital Library\n\n1766 births\nYear of death unknown\nEnglish women writers", "machine_text": ".

It is part of the Bro Ardudwy Ministry Area.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\nAs late as 1824, the parish church, St Mary's, Llanaber was the only Anglican place of worship in the area. At that time, the numbers of tourists and visitors was increasing and the Rector, Rev. T G Roberts, saw the necessity of building a new church for the English worshippers. So, in 1824, he convened a vestry meeting of the Churchwardens and the most influential church people of the district to discuss the advisability of erecting a Chapel of Ease. It was resolved to apply to the Bishop of Bangor for his permission, but the bishop only gave his assent on the condition that the cost of the building should be defrayed by voluntary subscription. The rector accomplished this task having immediately commenced collecting necessary funds.\n\nConstruction\nThese efforts on behalf of the church were rewarded and on 4 December 1830 Reverend Roberts was able to submit a plan and particulars of the proposed sanctuary. The church designed by Edward Haycock of Shrewsbury is a neat Cruciform structure built in the later style of English architecture and contains accommodation for 470 people of which 230 places were to be free, in consideration of a grant of £300 from the Incorporated Society for Building and Repairing Churches and Chapels.\n\nThe church was built at the southern end of Barmouth, on a site that was formerly a ship building yard. At the time of the erection of the church there was a great deal of opposition to the site; the opposing faction contending that sand-drifts would make the approach practically inaccessible.\n\nFor some years after the erection of this church, sand-drifts did indeed prove a source of great annoyance to the worshippers. A resident of Barmouth, Mr Black (author of 'A Picturesque Tour') exclaimed that St David's Church was very badly situated. Over time, the effects of sand-drifts eased and then ceased altogether.\n\nSupport\nAmong the chief supporters of the Anglican church in Barmouth in the 1830s and 1840s were a family called Ricketts who lived in Aberamffa House now modernised into Orielton Hall. In 1845, the Rector received a magnificent silver Sacrament Cup with the inscription 'The Offering of M. A. Rth' from Mrs Ricketts. The donation was accompanied by the following letter:\n\n\"Dear Sir, Captain Barrow will deliver to you a case containing the Sacramental Cup which we were accustomed to lend to the Chapel at Barmouth, for the celebration of the Communion. It is my wish to make a gift of it in perpetuity and I shall be obliged to you to have it noted in the Parish Documents so that it belongs absolutely to the Church.\"\n\nExtensions\n\n19th century\nAs time progressed it became very desirous that alterations should be effected and at a vestry meeting held to discuss the matter on 25 November 1886, it was resolved to build a new vestry - to have a wooden floor, a new approach at the north east corner and to have sundry other small alterations made at a total cost not exceeding £100.\n\nFurther additions and alterations were made over the course of the coming decades. The current altar was built in 1880, a font formed of five stone centre columns, was donated by Margaret and Edmund Humphreys and family and was originally placed by the main entrance. Mr Alex R Gibbs of London created and installed a wonderful stained glass window at the east end behind the altar in the 1880s.\n\n20th century\nDuring the 20th Century, a 2 manual Nicholson Organ was installed. It was done in 1910, when a new room was constructed to contain all of the new Organ's water pressure pumping equipment. In 1974, Lady Russon, the High Sheriff of Merionethshire, donated oil painting copies of cartoons drawn by Raphael depicting the lives of St Peter and St Paul. The originals are housed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nServices\nFrom the time of its erection until the opening of St John's Church in 1895, English services were held in the morning and Welsh services at night.  St David's is not currently open as a place of worship with all services taking place at St John's Church.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Barmouth\n St John's Church, Barmouth\n St Mary and St Bodfan Church, Llanaber\n\nSources\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Barmouth Parish site\n\nBarmouth, St David", "machine_text": " St David's Church, Barmouth is an Anglican church located in the town of Barmouth, in the county of Gwynedd, Wales. It is a Grade II listed building and is part of the Barmouth and Mawddach group of parishes within the deanery of Ardudwy and the Diocese of Bangor. The first recorded vicar was in 1340. The Church is a key element of the local area and its appearance adds to the character of Barmouth. It has been designed in a style often referred to as \"simple13th Century Gothic\". A large Welsh lintel above the entrance dated 1601 is a reminder of its past. The church is rectangular in shape with a low chancel, a south transept and the porch to the north. The interior contains a nave of four evenly-spaced bays, with the usual Gothic arcade of lancet windows with cinquefoiled ogee tops lighting the centre. There is a circular font of the 19th century with a tapering stem and a ribbed bowl. In 1850 a new vestry was added to the north side in a Victorian Gothic style. At the west end of the church is a three-lighted window containing a scene depicting St David and the two saints whose relics were reclaimed in a notable incident from the 12th century when some of the earlier reliquaries were stolen by a robber. This is the earliest window known to depict St David, the patron saint of Wales, in stained glass. The church is very active in the community, providing a place of worship for local people and visitors. Church activities include weekly services, special events and baptisms, and the church also supports an active community outreach program including donations to local charities. St David's holds regular concerts, concerts in the Park and fundraising events, and is a great centre of local pride.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32150427}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Forgive Me (TV series)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Forgive Me is a Canadian television drama series, about a young insomniac priest who gets caught up in the sins of his congregants while a secret from his own past threatens his calling.\n\nThe series is written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald. It stars Mike McLeod, John Dunsworth, Jane Alexander, Hugh Thompson, Olympia Dukakis, Brenda Fricker, Wendy Crewson, Bruce Davison, Jeremy Akerman, Ryan Doucette, Candy Palmater, Ed Asner, Gharrett Patrick Paon and Rob Joseph Leonard.\n\nThe series began its original broadcast on September 4, 2013 on Super Channel in Canada. It aired its second season in 2015, and its third in 2018.\n\nPlot\nThe Priest (Mike McLeod), whose actual name is never given throughout the series, is the junior priest at a Roman Catholic church in Nova Scotia. With young men now rarely joining the Catholic priesthood, he is serving under a Prelate (John Dunsworth) and older priests Gene (Jeremy Akerman) and Phil (Rob Joseph Leonard), who are all near retirement; he is planned to eventually take over as the parish's main pastor, but currently performs lesser duties such as hearing confessions. The Priest comes from a dysfunctional family background; he was raised primarily by his grandmother Novalea (Olympia Dukakis) after his mother abandoned the family, while his brother was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and has frequently bounced in and out of jail for various crimes.\n\nIn the first episode, The Priest learns that Victoria (Naomi Blackhall-Butler), his girlfriend before he entered the seminary, lied to him when she got pregnant with his baby; she claimed at the time that she had an abortion, but did not. In fact, he has a teenage daughter named Noelle (Lauren Liem), and thus faces the dilemma of how to take parental responsibility for her on a priest's salary while simultaneously preventing the parish and the bishop (Ed Asner) from finding out about it. At the same time, he is having trouble sleeping at night and is regularly haunted by visions of Saint Sebastian (Ryan Doucette), which is beginning to impact his physical health.\n\nThe centrepiece of each episode is an extended dialogue in the confessional booth between The Priest and a parishioner; outside of this, however, plot development takes place through multi-episode story arcs rather than each episode comprising a self-contained story, and the show carries the stories of a few confessioners through multiple episodes rather than featuring new confessioners every week. The confessions serve to explore both themes of moral complexity within Roman Catholic doctrine, and the ethical dilemmas facing The Priest as he tries to get involved in helping the parishioners with their issues outside the confession booth.\n\nThe show's main narrative throughline begins with the confession of Johnny \"Smith\" O'Leary (Hugh Thompson), who initially confesses to having had inappropriate sexual thoughts about an underage girl, but soon reveals that he was himself sexually abused as a child by a former choirmaster at this very church and that Father Gene was involved in covering it up, setting up The Priest's biggest ethical conflict as he cannot help O'Leary to pursue justice and healing without breaking the Seal of the Confessional or undermining his own employer. Secondary storylines include the journey of Bookie (Jane Alexander), a woman who left the church decades earlier after being told that she could not have an abortion even to end a non-viable pregnancy that would have killed her, toward reconciliation with the church after she is diagnosed with terminal cancer; the desire of Agnes (Candy Palmater) to become a single mother through in vitro fertilization; Sebastian's emergence as a real person who challenges The Priest over the church's position on homosexuality; and the struggles of Celeste (Wendy Crewson), a former federal Member of Parliament who lost her job as a media pundit after her role in a political scandal was revealed.\n\nCritical response\nThe series was generally well-received, attaining positive reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail compared it to In Treatment, praised Mike McLeod's performance as \"superb\", noted \"a visual sumptuousness that's startling\" and called it \"a powerful 30 minutes of television.\" Brad Oswald of the Winnipeg Free Press wrote \"The confessional-confined dialogue is smart, and the stripped-down performances are seamlessly delivered and punctuated with moments of pure, stark, painful honesty.\"\n\nWeb series\nIn 2016, the companion web series Forgive Me Web Confessions was launched, again starring McLeod as The Priest, with Keelin Jack, Krista MacDonald and Callum Dunphy as penitents.

Written and executive produced by BAFTA Award-winning writer Andrew Davies and based on the book of the same title by Anthony Minghella, the series follows Detective Inspector Mike Bolt (Ray Winstone). Bolt is a hard-bitten detective attached to the Special Crimes Unit. Over six episodes he and his team investigate a number of high-profile and special cases, often working alongside an informant known as \"The Mule\" (Luke Ashton) as they are pulled into a complex web of corruption, blackmail and moral dilemmas. The first episode of the show was originally broadcast on BBC One in August 2011. The series' cast includes a variety of experienced and familiar faces including Dominic West, Bill Nighy, Ruth Wilson, Kelly Macdonald, Robert Glenister and Penelope Wilton. Forgive Me's lead actor Ray Winstone draws particular praise for inhabiting the part of Detective Bolt, bringing a gravitas to the role that was highly complimented by critics. Film series writer Andrew Davies was praised for his work. Davies' grasp of the original source material was praised for providing an imaginative and exciting starting point for the series which he promised would be “a suspenseful and invigorated take on police investigations”. The episodes of the series follow Detective Bolt as he investigates and solves crimes with the help of his team and informant. In his own words Bolt notes that he doesn't trust anyone, pointing to a deep flaw within his characterisation and approach. As the series progresses Bolt slowly peels away the psychological layers inhibiting him from the tragedy of his own past. Forgive Me proves to be an extremely entertaining crime drama, with a narrative that effortlessly skims the surface of a much deeper theme - human nature. The characters provide a fascinating counterpoint to Bolt, each actor adding to the one-off nature of the series. Through this, Forgive Me succeeds in providing viewers with an intriguing — and sometimes thrilling — window into the inner workings of a criminal investigation, whilst asking important moral questions themselves. By providing a thought-provoking exploration of morality, justice and the human soul, Forgive Me quickly became a much discussed and highly enjoyable piece of television.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40604484}

They happened on various occasions and anniversaries, in many locations across the country. A notable air show was the Tushino Air Show held annually in August.\n\nDates\n\nSoviet Air Fleet Day\nThe most frequent date of air shows was the Soviet Air Fleet Day (). It was also known as the Soviet Air Forces Day (), or Soviet Aviation Day. It was established in 1933 and was most usually held on the third Sunday of August, weather permitting. The initial exhibition on 18 August 1933, was a result of Yakov Alksnis initiative, and was held in Khodynka Aerodrome (the Central Moscow Aerodrome), but since the next year the show became located on Tushino airfield near Moscow, where it remained for entire decades. In 1937, the parade was attended by nearly a million people, observing the masses of aircraft spelling in the sky \"LENIN\", \"STALIN\" and \"SSSR\". The celebrations repeated until the fall of Soviet Union, and continue in Russia (location is now Zhukovskiy airport, see MAKS airshow).\n\nMay Day\n\n1 May was dedicated to multitude of parades throughout the Soviet Union. They often included large-scale flypasts.\n\nOther\nThe Soviet Air Fleet Day became primarily associated with Soviet Air Forces (VVS), so a separate day has been established for Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO) a second arm of Soviet military that employed numerous fighter squadrons. It was called Soviet Air Defence Forces Day (), occurred on the second Sunday of April, and was celebrated with air parades of lesser scale.\n\nThe October revolution anniversary usually included air parade, but as it was held on 7 November, the aircraft were often cancelled because of weather conditions. The same problem pertained to 19 November, the Soviet Rocket Forces and Artillery Day.\n\nNotably, the 50th anniversary of October revolution air show was held in the summer, on 9 July 1967 at Domodedovo airport. In an unprecedented display of air power, it featured twelve new types or variants of military aircraft, and prompted concern in the West.\n\nNotable first appearances \n\nThe Soviet air shows conveyed more than entertainment. In the atmosphere of harshly enforced clandestinity, these air shows were frequently the main source of information about the recent aviation achievements of Soviet design bureaus (OKBs). Both Eastern and Western public opinion benefited from it, as well as foreign military intelligence.\n\nSee also \n Air show\n Flypast\n Military parade\n MAKS (air show), the current biennial Russian air show\n\nReferences \n\nAviation in the Soviet Union\nSoviet Air Force", "machine_text": " The Soviet Air Show, or the Air Show of the People's Commissariat in the Soviet Union (Авиационная праздник народного комиссариата СССР), was a series of established aeronautical events that took place annually in the Soviet Union from the 1920s to the early 1990s. The main purpose of the show was to promote the advances that had been made in Soviet aviation technology and to show off both civilian and military aircraft to a wide audience. The Soviet Air Show was initially held during the period of the Russian Civil War, and it quickly became an important way of displaying the aircraft and equipment of the Red Army. The world first came to learn of Soviet aircraft when the British delegation of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference visited the airfield at Moscow's Tushino Aircraft Factory and found the country's aviation and military aircraft. At the conclusion of the Paris Peace Talks, the enthusiasm of the foreign delegation propelled the Soviets to start planning a show that would demonstrate the progress of their newly formed aviation industry. As the Soviet Union's aviation industry expanded, the Air Show evolved from a local event in Moscow to an international spectacle. Popular with both Western and Eastern bloc countries, the show featured both civilian and military aircraft, including new Soviet products as well as those produced by other nations. A portion of the show was devoted to showcasing the aerial feats of the Soviet air forces and aerobatic teams were highly sought after. The air show drew considerable attention, especially in the Western world. Many countries sent their own officials and representatives to observe and learn more about Soviet military technology, and several foreign dignitaries attended the show, including the French President Charles de Gaulle. The show was also the perfect place to make diplomatic announcements, as Soviet aircraft and aerobatic teams symbolized the ever-growing political and economic strength of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Air Show continued until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. While the event is no longer a major event in Russia, it is still remembered for its grandeur and as a reflection of the technical achievements of the Soviet aviation industry.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31120417}

He eventually developed his own style, fusing traditional North African sounds with the rhythms of jazz, funk, flamenco and reggae. Sahraoui's first album \"Cheb Sahraoui and His Troupe\", released in 1955, was the first of many popular recordings that would remain in the North African music scene for years to come.

He toured extensively throughout Europe, becoming an icon of the Algerian musical scene. His unique style of mixing traditional Arabic music with western influences caused him to become renowned in many countries, even outside of North Africa. Sahraoui passed away in February 1990, at the age of 64. He left behind a large body of work, and is remembered today as one of the pioneers of Algerian folk music. Several of his songs were sampled and covered by prominent musicians, and his influence can still be heard in many modern genres.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to ten greenish-brown to purplish flowers with purple and white petals and a white labellum. It is restricted to subalpine areas of the state.\n\nDescription\nPrasophyllum mimulum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is  long and  wide. Between three and ten greenish-brown to purplish flowers are well-spaced along a flowering spike which is  long reaching to a height of . The flowers are  wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is  long and  wide and the lateral sepals are  long and  wide. The petals are purple with white edges and are  long,  wide. The labellum is white,  long, wide, and turns sharply upwards through more than 90° near its middle. There is a yellowish green callus in the centre of the labellum and extending just past the bend. Flowering occurs from January to March.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nPrasophyllum mimulum was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from near Lake Baillie in the Central Plateau Conservation Area of Tasmania and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet is from the Latin diminutive meaning \"imitating\" or \"mimicking\", referring to the overall similarities between this species and P. alpestre.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe highland leek orchid grows in grassland and moorland in subalpine areas of Tasmania.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nmimulum\nFlora of Tasmania\nEndemic orchids of Australia\nPlants described in 2004", "machine_text": " Prasophyllum mimulum, commonly known as the small Prasophylum, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is a terrestrial herb, growing up to 10 cm in height, with several leaves and a single, white flower. The flower has a noticeable mid-lobe, two lateral lobes, a dorsal sepal and two lateral petals. It is found in wet and dry sclerophyll forests, and is distributed throughout south-eastern Australia, from Victoria and New South Wales to Tasmania. The species epithet mimulum is derived from Latin, meaning \"small resemblance\". The flowers of Prasophyllum mimulum are easily recognised due to their small size. Prasophyllum mimulum is an obligate outcrosser and requires cross-pollination for successful seed-set. Pollination is carried out by a variety of bees, including large carpenter bees and small flower-visiting bees. As the flowers open, the lower labellum curls down to a horizontal position, providing a platform for the pollinator resting. The species is listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is threatened by a number of factors, including the alteration of fire regimes and the impact of invasive weeds and feral animals. However, its presence across much of south-eastern Australia may indicate that it is resilient to some extent. The species is likely to experience increased pressure from climate change and urban development. Some populations have become fragmented, reducing the number of pollinators, as well as genetic flow between populations. It is likely to need targeted conservation management and monitoring to ensure population resilience in the future. Prasophyllum mimulum is an attractive species and is popular amongst orchid enthusiasts. It can be propagated vegetatively from clumps or from seed and is easy to maintain in cultivation. It does best in well-draining, acidic soil, with plenty of air-flow and in partial shade. (Word count: 268)", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56235383}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"I'm Moving On (Yoko Ono song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"I'm Moving On\" is a song by Yoko Ono. It was originally recorded for 1980's Double Fantasy album, with John Lennon. A remix was released on iTunes on 25 September 2012. The remix debuted at number 39, and peaked at number 4.\n\nRecording\nDuring the Double Fantasy sessions, on August 12, 1980, a version of \"I'm Moving On\" was recorded with a lineup that included Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen and Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos.  Tony Levin played bass guitar, since Cheap Trick bassist Tom Petersson had recently left the group. The same lineup also recorded a version of Lennon's \"I'm Losing You\" the same day.  Neither song was released on Double Fantasy in their Cheap Trick-backed version.  Possible reasons for their exclusions are that Cheap Trick's management may have wanted too much money, or that Lennon believed that the performances were more \"heavy\" than he wanted.  On August 26, a revised version of \"I'm Moving On\" was recorded with the regular Double Fantasy session musicians consisting of Hugh McCracken and Earl Slick on guitar, Tony Levin on bass guitar, George Small on keyboards, Arthur Jenkins on percussion and Andy Newmark on drums.  Ono recorded her lead vocal on September 19.\n\nLyrics and music\n\"I'm Moving On\" is in some ways a companion piece to Lennon's \"I'm Losing You,\" which immediately precedes on Double Fantasy.  The songs are linked musically by series of electronic beeps and by a guitar lick played by Earl Slick, and share the same rhythm.  Producer Jack Douglas originally wanted the songs to be linked via a drum pattern he wanted Bun E. Carlos to play. \"I'm Losing You\" expresses Lennon's pain at the thought of losing Yoko Ono during a difficult time in their marriage.  \"I'm Moving On\" also addresses the possible loss of their relationship, but expresses her feelings of independence and willingness to say farewell.  Basically, \"I'm Moving On\" rebuffs Lennon's plea in \"I'm Losing You.\"  The singer accuses her lover of being false, objecting to his \"window smile,\" and warns him that she has no desire for intimacy with lines such as \"don't stick your finger in my pie.\"  Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer calls \"I'm Moving On\" an \"angry song\" expressing a \"harsh goodbye.\"  Ono stated to David Sheff of Playboy Magazine that the song is about \"the sense of 'Well, I've had enough.  I'm moving on.'  But it's not about any specific incident.  It's just the feeling: 'I don't want to play games.  I like everything straight.'  That's a feeling I have had.  I'm proud of the song.\"\n\nOther versions\nIn 2007, a version of \"I'm Moving On\" appeared on Ono's album Yes, I'm a Witch.  On this version, Ono was backed by The Sleepy Jackson.

(This version has yet to receive a commercial release on CD or digital streaming services.) In Japan, where the song was not released as a single, the b-side was \"It Happened\". \"I'm Moving On\" is an upbeat, synth-heavy exploration of growth and personal evolution. Featuring lyrics that espouse themes of standing tall and rising up to overcome, Ono flexes her vocal muscle with a powerful performance. This potent blend of a positive message and retro-influenced production gives the song a timeless quality. The song's video offers viewers a window into Ono's unique view of the world. Directed by Ono herself, the video focuses on her abstract images, including a building on fire, two spaced-out kids in a field, and a medley of colorful post-modern art. Despite its upbeat nature and optimistic message, \"I'm Moving On\" did not receive much attention upon its original release. However, the song has since become a cult classic and has been covered by several artists, including The Dø, whose version appears on their 2010 album A Mouthful. Ono herself has performed the song on several occasions, most recently at the 2017 Peace On Earth benefit concert in Los Angeles. The song has also been sampled by numerous artists, most notably in the 2003 track \"Never Catch Me\" by LA-based hip-hop group Freestyle Fellowship.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Brad Lidge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bradley Thomas Lidge (born December 23, 1976) nicknamed \"Lights Out\" is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002–2012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge is currently a host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio.\n\nLidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95–97 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87 mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5.\n\nEarly life\nLidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School. Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek's outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign.\n\nCollege career\nLidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8–2 record and 93 strikeouts in  innings.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHouston Astros (2002–2007)\n\nEarly career\nLidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n2003–04\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA.\n\nFollowing the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.  Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, \"I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.\"\n\n2005\n\nIn his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984.\n\nLater in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0–2 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n2006\nLidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.\n\n2007 \nThe Astros avoided contract arbitration with Lidge on January 17, 2007, by signing him to a one-year contract worth $5.35 million. After seeing Lidge struggle in spring training and blow his first save of the season, manager Phil Garner chose to make Dan Wheeler the new Astros closer, while offering Lidge opportunities to relieve in the sixth or seventh innings of games. He regained the closer role at the start of June, but was placed on the disabled list that same month after suffering a strained left oblique muscle. Although Lidge described to reporters that the injury bothered him less towards the end of the day, Garner chose to shut his closer down in order to keep the muscle strain from becoming a larger issue.\n\nAfter returning to the active roster on July 13, Lidge picked up his first save of the season on July 18, against the Washington Nationals. With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, there was speculation that the Astros, who had the third-lowest record in the National League (NL) would trade Lidge, but owner Drayton McLane told reporters, \"I see no reason we should even consider it. He's been one of the best closers in baseball.\" Instead, the club traded Wheeler to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for infielder Ty Wigginton. Despite his early-season struggles and injuries, Lidge finished the 2007 season 5–3 with 19 saves in 27 opportunities. He also held his opponents to a .218 batting average and record and average of 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9). After the season, Lidge underwent surgery to repair a cartilage tear in his right knee, with the anticipation that he would be healthy for the beginning of spring training.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2008–2011)\n\n2008\n\nIn February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4–3.  \n \nOn September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies.  He is the first closer since Éric Gagné in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.\n\nHe saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).\n\nLidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.\n\nHe received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award. Baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Closer of the Year. Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's Outstanding Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 26, 2009. He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News Sportsperson of the Year award.\n\nLidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.\n\n2009\nLidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in  innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee.\n\nAfter returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team's closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win-loss record of 0–8, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.\n\nIn the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8–6.  In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4–3 in the ninth inning.  He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5–4 victory.  Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7–4 win and a 3–1 lead in the series.  The Yankees went on to win the series in six games.\n\n2010\nLidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010, and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season. He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game.  On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAfter spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities.\n\n2011 \nAfter entering spring training fully healthy, Lidge was shut down on March 25 with pain in the back of his right shoulder, which he said was a new occurrence. An MRI revealed a posterior rotator cuff strain that did not require surgery, but would take three to six weeks to heal, and he began the 2011 MLB season on the disabled list. He underwent an eight-game rehab assignment with Lakewood and Reading, going 0–0 with a 3.52 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 7.2 innings before returning to the Phillies roster on July 22. Although his pitch velocity remained constant during Lidge's rehab appearances, with his fastball hovering around , Lidge and sports journalists alike voiced concerns over the pitcher's control: in one appearance for Reading, he threw only 15 strikes in 28 pitches.\n\nLidge did not return to the closer role even after coming off of the disabled list; instead, his setup man Ryan Madson filled the ninth inning, while Lidge found himself in competition with Antonio Bastardo over who would pitch the eighth. Despite seeing a decreased velocity on his fastball, Lidge found success in later innings with his slider, working up to an 11.29 K/9 by the end of September. Lidge's strong relationship with Madson helped both players adjust to their new positions. Lidge told reporters during the 2011 NLCS that, while Madson was closing, he would find himself \"shaking pitches off with [Madson]. I feel that I am there with him.\" Lidge played in 25 games during the 2011 season, during which he posted a 0–2 record with a 1.40 ERA and struck out 23 batters in  innings.\n\nWashington Nationals (2012) \n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Washington Nationals signed Lidge to a one-year, $1 million contract, plus additional incentives. He had not been signed as a closer for Washington, but after Drew Storen suffered from elbow inflammation during spring training, the team prepared to use Lidge and Henry Rodríguez in the ninth inning. The pair officially took over for Storen when the latter underwent surgery for a bone chip in his elbow. After allowing four earned runs in seven innings and blowing two saves, Lidge was placed on the disabled list with an abdominal wall strain. He was diagnosed with a sports hernia and underwent surgery on May 1, with an estimated recovery time of three weeks before he could begin throwing again. After pitching a perfect inning in a rehab assignment for the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals, Lidge was able to rejoin the Washington active roster on June 7, a week earlier than expected; he effectively replaced Rodríguez, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained finger. He was unable to perform with the Nationals, going 0–1 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11 bullpen appearances, with opposing hitters batting .308 against him. The Nationals designated Lidge for assignment on June 17 after two poor outings against the New York Yankees, and Ryan Mattheus was activated in his place. He was released from his contract shortly after, and returned home to Colorado in order to spend time with his family and consider whether or not he would pursue another contract.\n\nRetirement \nAfter being released from the Nationals, Lidge took the remainder of the summer to decide whether he wanted to continue his pitching career. On December 2, 2012, he announced his intentions to retire from baseball. At the time of his retirement, Lidge had 225 regular-season career saves, as well as 18 postseason saves. He also struck out 799 batters in  regular-season innings for a career 11.919 K/9, the second-best ratio of any pitcher with more than 500 innings. Lidge signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Phillies on August 1, 2013, enabling him to officially retire as a member of the organization.\n\nPersonal life\nLidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, daughter Avery Grace and son Rowan Thomas. He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies and takes online courses at Regis University. Lidge's cousin, Ryan Lidge, is currently a catcher in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nSee also\n\n Houston Astros award winners and league leaders\n List of Houston Astros no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball career saves leaders\n List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders\n List of Philadelphia Phillies award winners and league leaders\n List of University of Notre Dame athletes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1976 births\nLiving people\nBaseball players from Sacramento, California\nClearwater Threshers players\nCorpus Christi Hooks players\nHouston Astros players\nKissimmee Cobras players\nLakewood BlueClaws players\nLehigh Valley IronPigs players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nNational League All-Stars\nNew Orleans Zephyrs players\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players\nPotomac Nationals players\nPhiladelphia Phillies players\nQuad Cities River Bandits players\nReading Phillies players\nRound Rock Express players\nWashington Nationals players\nWorld Baseball Classic players of the United States\n2006 World Baseball Classic players", "machine_text": " Brad Lidge (born December 23, 1976) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the Houston Astros. He was an All-Star in 2005 and was a key member of the Astros team that won its first-ever National League (NL) pennant in 2005, as well as the Philadelphia Phillies World Series championship team in 2008. Lidge was born in Sacramento, California, and attended Catholic University in Washington, D.C., where he played college baseball for the Cardinals. He was selected by the Houston Astros in the first round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. Lidge made his Major League Baseball debut on April 5, 2002, and played with the Astros until being traded to the Phillies before the 2008 season. After training with the Astros in 2002, Lidge was called up in April and made fifty-five appearances out of the Astros bullpen. His first full season in the MLB came in 2003, when he appeared in seventy-two games and posted a 3.60 ERA. Lidge's breakout season came in 2004. He posted a 2.29 ERA in seventy-seven appearances and earned his first All-Star selection. The following season Lidge continued his success, posting a 2.94 ERA in seventy-one appearances. As a key member of the Astros bullpen, he helped lead the team to its inaugural NL pennant in 2005. During the postseason, he appeared in five games and posted a 0.87 ERA. Lidge signed with the Phillies prior to the 2008 season, and managed to duplicate his success with the Astros. As the team's closer, he appeared in seventy-one games and posted a 1.95 ERA. He was also a key member of the Phillies World Series championship team, as he posted a 0.65 ERA in eleven appearances. During the World Series, he earned a save in each of the five games, thus becoming the only Major League pitcher to earn a save in every game of a World Series. In 2009, Lidge struggled with his command, as he posted a 7.21 ERA in sixty appearances. He pitched better the following season, posting a 3.78 ERA in sixty-four appearances, but was still unable to recapture the form he had during his time with the Astros and Phillies. He split the 2011 season between the Phillies and Washington Nationals, and appeared in twenty games total, posting a 7.27 ERA in the process. Lidge signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates prior to the 2012 season and appeared in twenty-two games before being released on August 16. Lidge retired on February 2, 2013. In twelve MLB seasons, he compiled a career record of 28-42, with 225 saves and a 3.54 ERA in 520 games.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Qin (state)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Qin () was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Traditionally dated to 897 BC, it took its origin in a reconquest of western lands previously lost to the Rong; its position at the western edge of Chinese civilization permitted expansion and development that was unavailable to its rivals in the North China Plain. Following extensive \"Legalist\" reform in the 3rd century BC, Qin emerged as one of the dominant powers of the Seven Warring States and unified the seven states of China in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang. The Qin dynasty it established was short-lived but greatly influenced later Chinese history.\n\nHistory\n\nFounding\n\nAccording to the 2nd century BC historical text Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, the Qin state traced its origin to Zhuanxu, one of the legendary Five Emperors in ancient times.  One of his descendants, Boyi, was granted the family name of Yíng by Emperor Shun. During the Xia and Shang dynasties, the Yíng clan split in two: a western branch in that migrated across the Ordos Plateau to Quanqiu (present-day Lixian in Gansu), and an eastern branch that settled east of the Yellow River in modern Shanxi. The latter became the ancestors of the rulers of the later Zhao state.\n\nThe western Yíng clan at Quanqiu were lords over the Xichui (\"Western March\") region west of Mount Long and served as a barrier for the Shang dynasty against invasions by the Western Rong barbarians. One of them, Elai, was killed defending King Zhou of Shang during the rebellion led by Ji Fa that established the Zhou dynasty. The Yíng clan was however allied with the politically influential marquesses of Shen, whom the Zhou monarch relied upon heavily to manage the Rong people, and was thus allowed to retain their lands and continued serving as an attached vassal under the Zhou dynasty.  Feizi, a younger son of Elai's fourth-generation descendant Daluo, impressed King Xiao of Zhou so much with his horse breeding skills, that he was awarded a separate fief in the valley of Qin (present-day Qingshui and Zhangjiachuan County in Gansu) northeast of Quanqiu, and his seat was named Qinyi (in present-day Qintingzhen, Qingshui County). Both branches of the western Yíng clan lived in the midst of the Rong tribes, sometimes fighting their armies and sometimes intermarrying with their kings.\n\nIt has been suggested by scholars such as Annette Juliano and Arthur Cotterel that having a horse-breeder as their ancestor may imply that the Yíng family had a partial connection to nomadic tribes. As late as 266 BC, it was remarked by a noble of Wei that they shared customs with the Rong and Di tribes; the Central Plains states seemed to hold Qin culture and other peripheral states like Yan and Chu in low regard, due to the marginal location of their states.  Qin was the second state after Zhao to adopt cavalry tactics from the nomads.  Following the collapse of Zhou Dynasty, the Qin state absorbed cultures from two of the Four Barbarians from the west and north, which made the other warring states see their culture in low esteem. However, the Qin state was sensitive to the cultural discrimination by the Central Plains states and attempted to assert their Huaxia identity. This could be seen in an unusual statute of Qin Law, where mixed-ethnicity offsprings were all categorised as Huaxia, as well as in their preference for importing recruits from the neighbouring state of Jin.\n\nIn 842 BC, the nobles revolted against the corrupt King Li of Zhou in a coup known as the \"Countrymen's Riot\" (國人暴動), overthrowing him the following year, and the country subsequently fell into political turmoil.  The Xirong tribes used the opportunity to rebel against the Zhou dynasty, attacking and exterminating the senior branch of Yíng clan at Quanqiu, leaving the cadet branch at Qinyi the only surviving Yíng clan in the west.  After King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne in 827 BC, he made Qin Zhong, Feizi's great grandson, the commander of his forces in the campaign against Xirong.  Two years later in 822 BC, Qin Zhong was killed in battle and was succeeded by his eldest son Duke Zhuang. To commemorating Qin Zhong's loyalty, King Xuan summoned Duke Zhuang and his four younger brothers and gave them 7,000 soldiers.  The Qin brothers successfully defeated the Rong and recovered their lost patrimony formerly held by the deceased branch of Yíng clan, and King Xuan formally awarded them the territory of Quanqiu.  Duke Zhuang then moved his seat from Qinyi to Quanqiu, and had three sons.  When he died in 778 BC, his eldest son Shifu wanted to stay fighting the Xirong and avenge their grandfather, turning down the succession, so his second son Duke Xiang ascended as the clan leader.  Soon afterwards in 777 BC, Duke Xiang married his younger sister Mu Ying to a Rong leader called King Feng (豐王), in an apparent attempt to make peace.  The following year he moved the Qin capital eastward from Quanqiu to Qian (汧, in present-day Long County, Shaanxi), but Quanqiu soon fell to the Rong again after he left.  His older brother Shifu, who led the defence of Quanqiu, was captured by the Rong but was released a year later.\n\nIn 771 BC, the Marquess of Shen collaborated with the Zeng state and the Quanrong nomads, attacked and sacked the Zhou capital Haojing, killing King You of Zhou and ending the Western Zhou dynasty.  Duke Xiang led his troops to escort King You's son King Ping to Luoyi, where the new capital city of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was established.  In gratitude of Duke Xiang's service, King Ping formally enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and elevated Qin from an \"attached state\" (附庸 fùyōng, a minor state with limited self-rule under the authority of another liege lord) to a major vassal state with full autonomy, and further promised to permanently grant Qin the lands west of Qishan, the former heartland of Zhou, if Qin could expel the Rong tribes that were occupying it.  The following generations of Qin rulers were encouraged by this promise, and they launched several military campaigns against the Rong, eventually expanding their territories far beyond the original lands lost by the Western Zhou dynasty.  The Qin state therefore viewed the Zhou rulers King Wen and Wu as their predecessors, and themselves as the legitimate inheritors of their legacy.\n\nSpring and Autumn period\n\nBecause their main concern was the Rongs to the west, Qin's interaction with other states in central China remained minimal throughout the Spring and Autumn period (722481BC), except with its immediate eastern neighbour Jin, a large vassal of the Zhou. Qin maintained good diplomatic relations with Jin through intermarriages between the royal clans, but relations between both sides had also deteriorated to the point of armed conflict on occasions.\n\nDuring the early reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the Jin state was a formidable power under the leadership of Duke Xian of Jin. However, after the death of Duke Xian, Jin plunged into a state of internal conflict as Duke Xian's sons fought over the succession. One of them won the contention and became Duke Hui of Jin, but Jin was struck by a famine not long later in 647 BC and Duke Hui requested aid from Qin.  Out of goodwill due to his marriage to Duke Hui's half-sister, Duke Mu sent relief food supplies and agricultural equipment to Jin. However, when Qin was struck by famine the next year, Duke Hui refused to reciprocate with help, leading to the diplomatic deterioration between Qin and Jin and a war breaking out in 645 BC, which ended with Duke Hui being defeated and captured. Duke Mu later released him back to Jin after the latter agreed to cede land and sign an alliance.\n\nDuring the battles with Jin, Duke Mu overheard that one of Duke Xian's exiled sons, Chong'er, was taking refuge in the Chu state. After consulting his subjects, Duke Mu sent an emissary to Chu to invite Chong'er over, and supported him in his challenge and eventual defeat of his brother Duke Hui. After Chong'er become the new ruler of Jin as Duke Wen, he was more grateful to Duke Mu and relations between the two states improved.  With his eastern front stable, Duke Mu used the opportunity to launch military campaigns against the Rong tribes in the west.\n\nIn 630 BC, Qin and Jin agreed to wage war on the state of Zheng, but Duke Mu was lobbied by the Zhen emissary to abandon the alliance.  In 627 BC, Duke Mu planned a secret attack on Zheng, but the Qin army retreated after being tricked into believing that Zheng was already prepared for Qin's invasion. By that point Duke Wen had died and his personal alliance with Duke Mu no longer stood, and his successor Duke Xiang ordered an ambush for the retreating Qin army.  The Qin forces were defeated at the Battle of Xiao (near present-day Luoning County, Henan) and suffered heavy casualties, and all three of its generals were captured. Three years later, Qin attacked Jin for revenge and scored a major victory. Duke Mu refused to advance further east after holding a posthumous funeral service for those killed in action at the Battle of Xiao, and went back to focus on the traditional policy of expanding Qin's dominance in the west.  Duke Mu's achievements in Qin's western campaigns and his handling of foreign relations with Jin earned him a position among the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nIn 506 BC, King Helü of Wu defeated Chu in the Battle of Boju and captured the Chu capital Ying (present day Jingzhou).  Helü's advisor Wu Zixu, who was previously forced into exile by the already deceased King Ping of Chu and craved vengeance for the brutal execution of his father and brother, exhumed the King Ping's corpse and lashed it posthumously.  This was a great humiliation for the Chu state, so Shen Baoxu, a Chu official and a former friend of Wu Zixu, travelled to the Qin court and pleaded for assistance from Duke Ai of Qin to recover the capital.  After Duke Ai initially refused to help, Shen spent seven days crying in the palace courtyard, and Duke Ai was eventually moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu.  The famous poem named \"No Clothes\" (), recorded in the Classic of Poetry, was a battle hymn personally composed by Duke Ai to boost the morale of the Qin troops.  In 505 BC, the Qin and Chu armies jointly defeated Wu in several battles, allowing King Zhao of Chu to be restored and return to the recaptured capital.\n\nWarring States Period\n\nEarly decline\nDuring the early Warring States period, as its neighbours in the Central Plains began rapidly developing, Qin was still in a state of underdevelopment and decline.  The Wei state, formed from the Partition of Jin, became the most powerful state on Qin's eastern border.  Qin mostly relied on natural defenses such as the Hangu Pass (函谷關; northeast of present-day Lingbao, Henan) and Wu Pass (武關, in present day Danfeng County) in the east, to protect its Guanzhong heartland.  Between 413 and 409 BC during the reign of Duke Jian of Qin, the Wei army led by Wu Qi, with support from Zhao and Han, attacked Qin and conquered some Qin territories west of the Yellow River.\n\nLegalist reforms\n\nAfter suffering losses in the battles with rival states such as Wei, the Qin rulers actively pursued legal, economic social reforms. When Duke Xiao came to the throne of Qin, he issued an announcement calling forth men of talent (including scholars, administrators, theorists and militarists) from other states to enter Qin and help him with his reforms, promising rewards of high offices and lands in return.\n\nAmong these foreign talents, Shang Yang successfully conducted a series of Legalist reforms in Qin with the support of Duke Xiao, despite facing strong opposition from conservative Qin politicians. Direct primogeniture was abolished, with all commoners granted citizenship rights. Many were resettled in new clusters focusing on increasing agricultural output. Meritocracy was practised throughout, especially in the military, with soldiers and officers receiving due rewards according to their contributions, regardless of their backgrounds. However, tough and strict laws were imposed as well, with draconian punishments being meted out for the slightest of offences, and even the nobility and royalty were not spared. After decades, the reforms strengthened Qin economically and militarily, and transformed it into a highly centralized state with an efficient administrative system.\n\nAfter Duke Xiao's death, King Huiwen became the new ruler of Qin and he put Shang Yang to death by chariot-tearing on charges of treason, but some believed that the king harboured a personal grudge against Shang because he was harshly punished for a minor infraction in his adolescence under Shang's reformed system. However, King Huiwen and his successors retained the reformed systems and they helped to lay the foundation for Qin's eventual unification of China under the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC. Shang Yang's theories were further elaborated later by Han Fei, another Legalist scholar who combined Shang's ideas with those of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao, that would form the core of the philosophies of Legalism. Qin rose to prominence in the late 3rd century BC after the reforms and emerged as one of the dominant superpowers of the Seven Warring States.\n\nAscendancy\nQin's power continued growing in the following century after Shang Yang's reform, owing the success to the industriousness of its people. The Qin kings authorized many state development projects, including large public works such as irrigation canals and defensive structures.\n\nOne of the most obvious results of the reforms was the change in Qin's military. Previously, the army was under the control of Qin's nobles and comprised feudal levies. After Shang Yang's reforms, the aristocracy system was abolished and replaced by one based on meritocracy, in which ordinary citizens had equal opportunities as the nobles to be promoted to high ranks. In addition, military discipline was strongly enforced and the troops were trained to adapt better to different battle situations. Qin's military strength increased largely with the full support of the state. In 318 BC, the states of Wei, Zhao, Han, Yan and Chu formed an alliance and attacked Qin, but did not manage to advance beyond Hangu Pass, and were defeated by counter-attacking Qin forces. The alliance crumbled due to mistrust and suspicion and lack of coordination among the five states.\n\nApart from the effects on Qin's military, Shang Yang's reforms also increased labour for numerous public works projects aimed at boosting agriculture, and made it possible for Qin to maintain and supply an active military force of more than a million troops. This feat could not be accomplished by any other state, except Chu, during that time. Qin's conquests of the southern states of Ba and Shu in present-day Sichuan province also provided Qin with major strategic advantages. The lands in the new territories were very fertile, and helped serve as a \"backyard\" for supplies and additional manpower. It was hard for Qin's rivals to attack Ba and Shu, since the territories were located deep in the mountains upstream of the Yangtze River. At the same time, Qin's strategic position in Ba and Shu provided it with a platform for launching attacks on the Chu state, which lies downstream of the Yangtze.\n\nWars against Chu, Han, and Wei\n\nDuring the reign of King Huiwen of Qin, the Chu state to the southeast became a target for Qin's aggression. Although Chu had the largest operation-ready army of all the Seven Warring States at over a million troops, its administrative and military strength was plagued by corruption and divided among the nobles. Zhang Yi, a Qin strategist, suggested to King Huiwen to exercise Qin's interest at the expense of Chu. Over the following years, Zhang engineered and executed a number of diplomatic plots against Chu, supported by the constant military raids on Chu's northwestern border. Chu suffered many defeats in battles against Qin and was forced to cede territories to Qin. King Huai I of Chu was furious and ordered a military campaign against Qin, but he was tricked by Zhang Yi into breaking diplomatic ties with his allies, and his angered allies joined Qin in inflicting a crushing defeat on Chu. In 299 BC, King Huai I was tricked into attending a diplomatic conference in Qin, where he was captured and held hostage until his death. In the meantime, Qin launched several attacks on Chu and eventually sacked the Chu capital city of Chen (陳; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei province). The crown prince of Chu fled east and was crowned King Qingxiang of Chu in the new capital city of Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui province).\n\nIn the next five decades after King Huiwen's death, King Zhaoxiang of Qin shifted his attention to the Central Plains after the victories in the south against Chu. In the early years of King Zhaoxiang's reign, the Marquis of Rang (穰侯) served as Qin's chancellor and he actively pushed for military campaigns against the Qi state in the far eastern part of China. However, the marquis had his personal motives, as he intended to use Qin's powerful military to help him conquer a fief in Qi territories, since the lands were not directly linked to Qin and would not be under the Qin government's direct administration.\n\nSubsequently, King Zhaoxiang's foreign advisor, Fan Sui, advised the king to abandon those fruitless campaigns against distant states. King Zhaoxiang heeded Fan's advice and changed Qin's foreign policy to adopting good diplomatic relations with distant states (Yan and Qi), while concentrating on attacking nearby states (Zhao, Han and Wei). As a consequence, Qin began to launch constant attacks on Han and Wei over the next decades, conquering several territories in its campaigns. By then, Qin's territories had expanded to beyond the eastern shore of the Yellow River and Han and Wei were reduced to the status of \"buffers\" from Qin for the other states in the east.\n\nWars against Zhao\n\nStarting from 265 BC, Qin launched a massive invasion on Han and forced Han to cede its territory of Shangdang (上黨; in present-day Shanxi province). However, Han offered Shangdang to Zhao instead, which led to a conflict between Qin and Zhao for control of Shangdang. Qin and Zhao engaged in the three-year-long Battle of Changping, followed by another three-year siege by Qin on Zhao's capital city of Handan. The conflict at Changping was deemed as a power struggle, as both sides pitted their forces against each other not only on the battlefield, but also in the domestic context. Although Qin had an abundance of resources and vast manpower, it had to enlist every man above the age of 15 for war-related duties, ranging from front-line service to logistics and agriculture. King Zhaoxiang of Qin even personally directed his army's supply lines. The extent of mobilization and the exhaustion in the aftermath was not seen in world history for another 2,000 years, until this concept of total war re-entered the stage during World War I. Qin's eventual victory in 260 BC was attributed to its use of schemes to stir up internal conflict in Zhao, which led to the replacement of Zhao's military leaders.\n\nFollowing the Qin victory at the Battle of Changping, the Qin commander Bai Qi ordered the 400,000 prisoners-of-war from Zhao to be executed by burying them alive. Subsequently, the Qin forces marched on the Zhao capital city of Handan in an attempt to conquer Zhao completely. However, the Qin troops were unable to capture Handan as they were already exhausted and also because the Zhao forces put up fierce resistance. King Xiaocheng of Zhao offered six cities to Qin as a peace offer and King Zhaoxiang of Qin accepted the offer after being persuaded by Fan Sui. Within Zhao, many officials strongly opposed King Xiaocheng's decision to give up the cities and subsequent delays caused the siege on Handan to be prolonged until 258 BC. Meanwhile, Bai Qi was consecutively replaced by Wang Xi, Wang Ling and Zheng Anping as the Qin commander at the siege.\n\nIn 257 BC, Qin was still unable to penetrate Handan after besieging it for three years, and Zhao requested aid from the neighbouring states of Wei and Chu. Wei was hesitant to help Zhao initially, but launched an attack on Qin after seeing that Qin was already exhausted after years of war. The Qin forces crumbled and retreated and Zheng Anping surrendered. The combined forces of Wei and Chu continued to pursue the retreating Qin army and Wei managed to retake part of its original lands that were lost to Qin earlier.\n\nInfrastructural works\nIn the middle of the 3rd century BC, Zheng Guo, a hydraulic engineer from the Han state, was sent to Qin to advise King Zhaoxiang of Qin on constructing irrigation canals. Qin had a penchant for building large-scale canals, as evident from its Min River irrigation system. King Zhaoxiang approved Zheng Guo's idea on constructing an even bigger canal. The project was completed in 264 BC and the canal was named after Zheng. Qin benefitted from the project as it became one of the most fertile states in China due to the good irrigation system, and also because it could now raise more troops as a consequence of increased agricultural yield.\n\nUnification\n\nIn 247 BC, the 13-year-old Ying Zheng became king of Qin after the sudden death of King Zhuangxiang. However, Ying Zheng did not wield state power fully in his hands until 238 BC, after eliminating his political rivals Lü Buwei and Lao Ai. Ying formulated a plan for conquering the other six states and unifying China with help from Li Si and Wei Liao.\n\nIn 230 BC, Qin attacked Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States, and succeeded in conquering Han within a year. Since 236 BC, Qin had been launching several assaults on Zhao, which had been devastated by its calamitous defeat at the Battle of Changping three decades ago. Although Qin faced strong resistance from the Zhao forces, led by general Li Mu, it still managed to defeat the Zhao army by using a ploy to sow discord between King Qian of Zhao and Li Mu, causing King Qian to order Li Mu's execution and replace Li with the less competent Zhao Cong. Zhao eventually fell to Qin in 228 BC after the capital city of Handan was taken. However, a Zhao noble managed to escape with remnant forces and proclaim himself king in Dai. Dai fell to Qin six years later.\n\nAfter the fall of Zhao, Qin turned its attention towards Yan. Crown Prince Dan of Yan sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng but the assassination attempt failed and Qin used that as an excuse to attack Yan. Yan lost to Qin at a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River in 226 BC and King Xi of Yan fled with remnant forces to Liaodong. Qin attacked Yan again in 222 BC and annexed Yan completely. In 225 BC, the Qin army led by Wang Ben invaded Wei and besieged Wei's capital city of Daliang for three months. Wang directed the waters from the Yellow River and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang and King Jia of Wei surrendered and Wei was conquered.\n\nIn 224 BC, Qin prepared for an attack on Chu, its most powerful rival among the six states. During a discussion between Ying Zheng and his subjects, the veteran general Wang Jian claimed that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, but the younger general Li Xin thought that 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng put Li Xin in command of the Qin army to attack Chu. The Chu defenders, led by Xiang Yan, took Li Xin's army by surprise and defeated the Qin invaders. The defeat was deemed as the greatest setback for Qin in its wars to unify China. Ying Zheng put Wang Jian in command of the 600,000 strong army as he had requested and ordered Wang to lead another attack on Chu. Wang scored a major victory against the Chu forces in 224 BC and Xiang Yan was killed in action. The following year, Qin pushed on and captured Chu's capital city of Shouchun, bringing an end to Chu's existence. In 222 BC, the Qin army advanced southward and annexed the Wuyue region (covering present-day Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces).\n\nBy 221 BC, Qi was the only rival state left. Qin advanced into the heartland of Qi via a southern detour, avoiding direct confrontation with the Qi forces on Qi's western border and arrived at Qi's capital city of Linzi swiftly. The Qi forces were taken by surprise and surrendered without putting up resistance. Following the fall of Qi in 221 BC, China was unified under the rule of Qin. Ying Zheng declared himself \"Qin Shi Huang\" (meaning \"First Emperor of Qin\") and founded the Qin Dynasty, becoming the first sovereign ruler of a united China.\n\nCulture and society\n\nBefore Qin unified China, each state had its own customs and culture. According to the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu, composed in the 4th or 5th century BC and included in the Book of Documents, there were nine distinct cultural regions of China, which are described in detail in this book. The work focuses on the travels of the titular sage, Yu the Great, throughout each of the regions. Other texts, predominantly military, also discussed these cultural variations.\n\nOne of these texts was The Book of Master Wu, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the military threat posed by competing states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in. Of Qin, he said:\n\nAccording to Wu, the nature of the people is a result of the government, which is in turn a result of the roughness of the terrain. Each of the states is expounded upon by Wu in this manner.\n\nFollowing a visit to Qin in 264 BC, the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang noted that Qin society was \"simple and unsophisticated\" and their people stood in awe of their officials, but was completely devoid of Confucian literati. Though disliked by many Confucians of its time for \"dangerously lacking in Confucian scholars,\" Confucian Xun Kuang wrote of the later Qin that \"its topographical features are inherently advantageous,\" and that its \"manifold natural resources gave it remarkable inherent strength. Its people were unspoiled and exceedingly deferential; its officers unfailingly respectful, earnest, reverential, loyal, and trustworthy; and its high officials public-spirited, intelligent, and assiduous in the execution of the duties of their position. Its courts and bureaus functioned without delays and with such smoothness that it was as if there were no government at all.\"\n\nIn his Petition against driving away foreigners (諫逐客書), Li Si mentioned that guzheng and percussion instruments made of pottery and tiles were characteristic of Qin music.\n\nRulers\n\nList of Qin rulers based on the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, with corrections by Han Zhaoqi:\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe events during the reigns of Duke Xiao, King Huiwen, King Wu and King Zhaoxiang are romanticised in a series of historical novels by Sun Haohui.

It was located in modern-day Shanxi province. The Qin was one of the strongest states in the Warring States period, and would eventually become the first unified dynasty of China. Qin was a powerful state, ruled by the toothed King Zhao, also known as Duke Huan of Qin. It conquered many of its neighboring states, including Yan and Qi, and ultimately united them under its banner. The Qin was militaristic. Much of its power came from the militarization of the State of Jin, which consisted of conscription, standardization of weapons, and ensuring a standing army with constant local squadrons. In 221 BC, Qin would become the first unified dynasty of China. This was largely due to the reforms of the first emperor, Ying Zheng, who implemented a number of policies to centralize power and set the stage for a powerful empire. Each prefectures within Qin was required to regularly send representatives and tributes to the emperor, and many of the powers of the feudal lords were further curtailed. This created a more powerful monarchy, and the Qin dynasty became increasingly autocratic. The next 100 years of Qin's rule was spent in expansion and conquest. At its peak, its control included most of the current day provinces of China, and parts of Manchuria. This expansion was aided by strong centralized bureaucracy, and a system of standardized written Chinese, commonly known as the Qin script. The Qin also constructed many structures throughout their empire, most famously, the Great Wall of China. The Qin dynasty was overthrown in 207 BC by the forces of Liu Bang, and replaced with the Han dynasty. The bulk of the Qin's accomplishments, however, were still important components of the new dynasty. The system of centralized power, the creation of the Great Wall, and the Qin script all survived the transition to the new regime, and continue to play a role in Chinese society even today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 361005}

The diocese was subject to a number of changes in title, until the current unified title of the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry was officially confirmed in 1742. Since then the bishops have had a number of responsibilities, including running the Church of Ireland schools in the diocese, officiating at church services, confirming parishioners and ordaining clergy. The current bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is Patrick Rooke. He is assisted by four archdeacons, who look after day-to-day administration in their respective archdeaconries. Each archdeaconry is divided into parishes, each of which has a number of churches. There are approximately 300 church buildings in the diocese, some of which are ancient, while others are more modern. The Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry is an important part of the leadership and administration of the Church of Ireland in Connacht. He oversees the diocese, provides pastoral care and episcopal ministry, and represents the Church of Ireland in the wider world. The see is a vibrant and active part of the province of Connacht and the Church of Ireland.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15255485}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Williams–Landel–Ferry equation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Williams–Landel–Ferry Equation (or WLF Equation) is an empirical equation associated with time–temperature superposition.\n\nThe WLF equation has the form\n \nwhere  is the decadic logarithm of the WLF shift factor, T is the temperature, Tr is a reference temperature chosen to construct the compliance master curve  and C1, C2 are empirical constants adjusted to fit the values of the superposition parameter aT.\n\nThe equation can be used to fit (regress) discrete values of the shift factor aT vs. temperature. Here,  values of shift factor aT are obtained by horizontal shift log(aT) of creep compliance data plotted vs. time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature T superposes with the data set at temperature Tr. A minimum of three values of aT are needed to obtain C1, C2, and typically more than three are used.\n\nOnce constructed, the WLF equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested. In this way, the master curve can be applied to other temperatures. However, when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the  glass transition temperature (Tg), the WLF equation is applicable to temperatures at or above Tg only; the constants are positive and represent Arrhenius behavior. Extrapolation to temperatures below Tg is erroneous. When the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below Tg, negative values of C1, C2 are obtained, which are not applicable above Tg and do not represent Arrhenius behavior. Therefore, the constants obtained above Tg are not useful for predicting the response of the polymer for structural applications, which necessarily must operate at temperatures below Tg.\n\nThe WLF equation is a consequence of time–temperature superposition (TTSP), which mathematically is an application of\nBoltzmann's superposition principle. It is TTSP, not WLF, that allows the assembly of a compliance master curve that spans more time, or frequency, than afforded by the time available for experimentation or the frequency range of the instrumentation, such as dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).\n\nWhile the time span of a TTSP master curve is broad, according to Struik, it is valid only if the data sets did not suffer from ageing effects during the test time. Even then, the master curve represents a hypothetical material that does not age. Effective Time Theory. needs to be used to obtain useful prediction for long term time.\n\nHaving data above Tg, it is possible to predict the behavior (compliance, storage modulus, etc.) of viscoelastic materials for temperatures T>Tg, and/or for times/frequencies longer/slower than the time available for experimentation. With the master curve and associated WLF equation it is possible to predict the mechanical properties of the polymer out of time scale of the machine (typically  to  Hz), thus extrapolating the results of multi-frequency analysis to a broader range, out of measurement range of machine.\n\nPredicting the Effect of Temperature on Viscosity  by the WLF Equation \n\nThe Williams-Landel-Ferry model, or WLF for short, is usually used for polymer melts or other fluids that have a glass transition temperature.\n\nThe model is:\n\nwhere T-temperature, , ,  and  are empiric parameters (only three of them are independent from each other).\n\nIf one selects the parameter  based on the glass transition temperature, then the parameters ,  become very similar for the wide class of polymers.

It is a phenomenological equation that is used to describe how different substances display different mechanical or thermal behavior under varying conditions, including stress, temperature, and strain. The WLF equation has been used extensively in a variety of engineering fields, including materials science and catalysis. The WLF equation was derived by British materials scientist W.G. Williams in 1935 and was further refined by F.H. Landel and M.F. Ferry in 1955. It is often referred to as the Williams–Landel–Ferry equation, or simply the WLF equation. The WLF equation is applicable to most unnatural substances, such as plastics, elastomers, rubbers, and viscous liquids, at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The WLF equation expresses time-dependent behavior as a function of temperature, and is expressed as follows: ẑ = A exp[α(T - Tᵢ)] + B exp[-β(T - Tᵢ)] where ẑ is the response/behavior of the material, T is the absolute temperature, Tᵢ is a reference temperature, A and B are constants, and α and β are parameters that represent the structural changes of the material with temperature. The two terms in the equation represent two distinct parameters. The first term (A exp[α(T - Tᵢ)]) is referred to as the time-temperature superposition term, which is related to the rubber-like molecular response of the material in question. The second term (B exp[-β(T - Tᵢ)]) is called the glassy state term, which is related to the glassy state of the material. The WLF equation can be used to describe a variety of material behaviors, including viscoelasticity, temperature-dependent mechanical properties, creep, and relaxation. It is applicable to most unnatural materials over a wide range of temperatures, and is one of the most widely used equations in engineering due to its simplicity and ease of use. Its accuracy depends on adequate characterization of the material for which it is being applied, as well as empirical data for the parameters that are used with the equation. The WLF equation is widely used in a variety of fields, including polymers, catalysis, materials science, mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. It has been used to model a wide range of materials, including polymers, viscous liquids, solids, and rubber-like materials. The equation has also been found useful in predicting the behavior of polymers in different conditions, such as temperature, shear rate, and pressure.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24917031}

It was developed by American psychologist Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen in 1978 and has since been widely accepted as an invaluable tool in the research and analysis of facial expressions and emotion. FACS is used to code and measure all visible facial movements such as brow lowering, cheek raising, and lip pouting. Developed based on the anatomic musculature of the face and neck, it consists of Action Units (AUs)—44 in total—which are codes referring to single unitary facial movements. Each AU is composed of several independent elements; for example, \"AU 6,\" which codes for 'cheek raiser,' consists of three independent elements: raising of the inner and outer parts of the eyebrows and raising of the cheeks. The proposed FACS system is composed of two parts: facial Action Descriptions (FADs) and quantitative Coding Manuals (QCMs). The former describes facial movements in terms of seven basic facial Action Units (AUs), which are numbered from 1 to 44. Each FAD consists of four components: the FAD code for the facial movement, the list of different parts of the face involved in the movement, the intensity level of the movement, and a description of how to identify the movement. The QCMs provide researcher-friendly descriptions of the facial movements and allow measurement of the degree and frequency of each movement. Unlike many other facial expression coding systems, FACS is based on a “bottom-up” approach, in which specific facial muscle movements result in collectively understood expressions. This approach ensures that FACS can adequately describe any facial movement that is observable to the naked eye, making it universally applicable. Additionally, the high level of precision and reliability achievable with FACS allows its usage to be extended beyond facial expressions and emotion research, in domains such as social and market research. In conclusion, FACS has been a valuable scientific progress and an important tool in the domain of facial expression analysis and emotion research. Developed from a highly detailed and objective approach, FACS is a comprehensive and reliable system for the comprehensive description of facial muscle movement. Its usage extends beyond facial expressions to various fields of psychology and beyond, making it a valuable and versatile tool.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1476716}

His name is closely linked to the history of Florence, the Tuscan town where he was born and the setting of many of his majestic paintings. Augustino was the son of a mason, Luca Oldoini, and Antonia Limanti. He was one of eight siblings, represented by his father in his versatile artwork. After completing basic studies in Florence, Augustino worked as an apprentice to the local trade of an etcher. From his early years, Augustino's facility for drawing and understanding of the technical world were evident. When he was 16, he was admitted to the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze, where he pursued his formal art training. Professor P. Mori especially favored Augustino and gave him a stipend to study in Rome for a few years. He then moved to Paris, where he was welcomed by the Italian art community. He completed some of his most remarkable paintings in Paris, such as Il Tramonto (The Sunset) and La Notte di San Lorenzo (The Night of San Lorenzo), both exhibited in the Salon of Paris in 1867 and 1869. During this French period of his life, Augustino Oldoini met a Parisian art lover who became his friend and patron. With his support, he was able to travel and make many other trips as he left Paris. In 1874, he was in London, where he obtained a new artistic experience and completed his work La Valle dell'Orenoque (The Valley of the Orenoque). When Augustino returned to Italy, he settled in Milan. During this time, he completed numerous works in oil paints and watercolors, including portraits, landscapes, figurative pieces and the religious subject of Cavallieri San Giovanni Battista e Sant'Eustachio (Knights Saint John the Baptist and Saint Eustace). Augustino Oldoini was known for his ability to recreate glowing sunsets, shimmering lake scenes, cloud-filled skies and gorgeous garden vistas. He held solo exhibitions throughout Europe and sometimes auctioned his works in galleries. Because of his work, he was awarded the title of Knight of the Italian Royal Order of the Crown by King Umberto I in 1877. Augustino passed away in 1884, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful artwork that celebrates the beauty of the Tuscan landscape and its people.

The origins of Maryhill Estates can be traced back to the mid-1800s, when the area was home to a small community of farmers. By the turn of the century, the area had become a bustling center of trade, with a number of businesses and manufacturing facilities setting up shop. The primary business of the day was the production of coal tar and coke byproducts. As the demand for coal tar and coke grew, more businesses and farms were established in the region, and the population of the area began to swell. The area was first developed into a residential community in the early part of the 20th century, when a group of local real estate developers bought up a portion of land and began the process of subdividing it into residential lots. The development was publicly marketed as a “Satellite Town” for Cynthiana in 1929, and construction began soon after. The new homes quickly attracted a number of affluent professionals, who were looking for a quieter, more rural setting. The combination of the rich agricultural resources, beautiful scenery, and proximity to Cynthiana soon made Maryhill Estates a popular place to call home. As the residential population of the area continued to grow, so did the number of businesses, stores and other services that were established.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The One with the Embryos\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"The One with the Embryos\" is the twelfth episode of Friends fourth season. It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on January 15, 1998. In the episode, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) agrees to be the surrogate mother for her brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp). Meanwhile, a display by Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) of how well they know Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) by guessing the items in their shopping bag leads to a large-scale bet on a quiz, for which Ross (David Schwimmer) acts as the gamemaster.\n\nThe episode was directed by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin. The idea for Kudrow's character Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother coincided with the actress' real-time pregnancy. The producers wanted to find a way to use the pregnancy in a narrative for the fourth season and designated the task to the writers. Ribisi and Rupp reprised their recurring roles of Frank Jr. and Alice respectively which was initially difficult as both had filming commitments.\n\nIn its original broadcast on NBC, \"The One with the Embryos\" acquired a 17.3 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked fourth. The episode received critical acclaim, is generally considered one of the best of the entire series, and is a favorite amongst the cast members and producers. In 2009, \"The One with the Embryos\" was ranked #21 on TV Guide'''s list of \"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time.\"\n\nPlot\nRachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica (Courteney Cox) are woken up too early in the morning by Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler's (Matthew Perry) chick and duck, as the maturing chick has just begun crowing. Later, as Rachel returns with her shopping and complains to the others about the situation, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) urges the boys to get rid of their birds as they should not be living in an apartment.\n\nAs Phoebe leaves for her doctor's appointment to get her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice's (Debra Jo Rupp) embryo transferred into her uterus, Monica and Joey enter having an argument after Joey boasts that he and Chandler know more about Rachel and her than vice versa. Chandler backs Joey up, and the two correctly identify the contents of Rachel's shopping bag. Monica suggests a trivia contest to see who knows more about whom: the men or the women. They place a $100 bet on the outcome and Ross (David Schwimmer) puts together some questions and plays as host.\n\nMeanwhile, Phoebe learns that the doctor will implant five of Frank and Alice's embryos into her uterus, which only has a 25% chance of success. She offers to do this as many times as possible for them, but is concerned when the two reveal that they are paying $16,000, which is all of their savings, for the single IVF procedure, and is helpless to influence the results.\n\nThe trivia game begins, with various facts about the characters being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-all score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica immediately agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.\n\nAs the four pack up their respective apartments—Rachel, in particular, displeased about having to switch—Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test, though it is too soon for a result, so she sits in the apartment for several days waiting for another result. Later with packing complete, Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test. The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.\n\nThe tag scene shows Rachel and Monica horrified at having to deal with living in Chandler and Joey's cramped and dirty apartment, while the boys are content to live in the girls' large apartment.\n\nProduction\n\n\"The One with the Embryos\" was co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin and directed by Kevin S. Bright. In October 1997, Lisa Kudrow announced she and her husband Michel Stern were expecting their first child. When Marta Kauffman first learned of Kudrow's pregnancy, she was overjoyed and wanted to find a solution of incorporating it into the show without choosing to cover up. At the time of filming \"The One with the Embryos\" in December, Kudrow was four months pregnant and the writers discussed ways of narrating the pregnancy on the show, settling with Kudrow's character carrying her brother's embryos.\n\nAccording to David Crane, the story arc with Phoebe carrying Frank and Alice's baby was considered \"risky\". When the plot was first discussed, the main concern was whether it was \"too crazy … where's the line with Phoebe?\". Crane felt if it were not for the actors, the storyline would not have been believable. The producers found it difficult to get Giovanni Ribisi to reprise his role as Frank Jr. on a longer term basis because the actor had continuous filming commitments. A similar situation occurred with Debra Jo Rupp, who was named as a cast member in the upcoming period sitcom, That '70s Show on the Fox network.\n\nThe chick and the duck, who first appeared in \"The One with a Chick and a Duck\" as Chandler and Joey's pets were used \"as a spark\" for the main plot. The animals were originally intended for one episode but because the producers believed they got \"so much mileage out of them\", they made recurring appearances. As many television shows used similar fictional pets, the producers settled on a chicken and a duck as they were different.\n\nThe idea for the trivia contest came up in the writers' room, partially based on a real game that writer Seth Kurland watched his friends play. The \"Miss Chanandler Bong\" joke was inspired by an incident from Kurland's childhood when his surname was misspelled on an address label.\n\nKauffman told TV Guide the writers felt it was important that the trivia contest reveal new information about the characters \"otherwise it's just exposition.\" The answer \"Viva Las Gay-gas\" in response to 'What is the name of Chandler's dad's show in Vegas?' changed \"about a million times\" in drafts according to Crane. On the night the show was being filmed, writers continued to pitch for different answers in order to receive a better response from the audience. The staff found it difficult coming up with different points of view for each character as all wanted to win the game.\n\nThe writers decided to go through with the apartment switch to avoid creating fake stakes, which they called \"schmuck bait\". \"The discussion was if we do it, we have to stick to it,\" Crane said. There was never discussion of changing the look of either apartment because \"the fun of it was that they were in spaces they 'shouldn't' be in,\" according to Bright.\n\nReception\nIn its original airing, \"The One with the Embryos\" finished fourth in ratings for the week of January 12–January 18, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 17.3, equivalent to approximately 16.8 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on NBC that week, following ER, Seinfeld and Veronica's Closet–all of which aired on the network's Thursday night Must See TV lineup.\n\n\"The One with the Embryos\" was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc's favorite episode of the series. Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive, while LeBlanc spoke fondly of the pace of the episode and the information about the characters that came out. He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best, \"because you don't have to introduce a character—you don't have to lay any pipeline—you just get right to the funny\". On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Marta Kauffman cited the episode being \"so much fun to do\" and enjoyed the writing process. The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright's favorite in the show's history because of Kudrow's ability to \"draw you into the scene ... even though it's only her talking to the dish\". David Crane highlights how the episode explores generosity; doing a selfless act which pays off when Phoebe  gives birth in \"The One Hundredth\". Bright moreover felt the trivia contest was the catalyst that rejuvenated the entire fourth season and \"put Friends in a different place\".\n\nIn a 2001 review, Entertainment Weekly rated the episode A+, stating that \"Thanks to the trivia contest alone, Embryos is quite possibly Friends' finest moment\". The article singles out Rachel's line \"He's a transpon—transpondster!\" (in response to the question \"What is Chandler Bing's job?\") as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends called it a \"sure-fire contender for the best episode of all time ... not one to be missed under any circumstances\". In 2004, Tara Ariano of MSNBC.com wrote that the character trivia is \"revealed in a manner completely organic to the plot. Beautifully written and acted, 'The One With The Embryos' encapsulates the whole series in a single episode\". The episode was ranked #21 on TV Guides list of \"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\".\n\nIn a 2018 oral history marking the episode's 20th anniversary, TV Guide declared it the series' best episode and \"Friends'' at its peak, a lightning-in-a-bottle gem.\" Kauffman said she hopes \"the episode's legacy is what people would say about the series, which is it's really funny and real and sweet.\"\n\nMerchandise\nThe episode was released as part of Friends: The Complete Fourth Season in Regions 1, 2 and 4. As part of the DVD release, \"Who Knows Whom Best? – Ross's Ultimate Challenge\" an interactive game was included, based on the quiz in \"The One with the Embryos\". The game uses clips from the show to provide answers, allows viewers to choose a team (boys or girls) and call the coin toss.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\"The One with the Embryos\" at the Internet Movie Database\n\nFriends (season 4) episodes\n1998 American television episodes", "machine_text": " The One with the Embryos is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season of the American television sitcom Friends, which aired on NBC on January 15, 1998. It was written by series creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and directed by Kevin S. Bright. The episode focuses on a trivia challenge between Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) to decide who gets a recently acquired apartment. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) and Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) act as the \"trivia masters\" to ask the questions. Rachel and Monica call their respective groups of friends to coach them. Phoebe and Joey, along with Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), bet their possessions on the outcome of the challenge. Meanwhile, Chandler and Monica show interest in each other, and Chandler tries to break the news that he and Rachel are no longer together. In the game, Rachel and Monica are asked questions about each other, including items found in the apartment, past in-jokes and memories, and general knowledge. As the game progresses, Rachel and Monica start to reveal hidden secrets and truths that they know about each other. In the end, Rachel wins the apartment. The episode earned 23 million American viewers and was ranked the third most watched show of the week. The episode was well received by fans, who appreciated the nostalgia and references to past events in the fandom. The title is derived from the joke by Joey during the trivia game, about when he and Chandler got stung by a bee, when performing a mating dance to attract women. The “official” name for this dance was the “Embryo Dance”. This episode furthers the first hints of the romantic relationship between Chandler and Monica, which continues for the remainder of the series. It also reinforces the importance of friendship in the series, with Rachel and Monica often competing against each other, but in the end still being best friends. The episode was well received by critics, who noted its nostalgia and humor, and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3485095}

After independence in 1960, Radio Nationale du Mali (Radio-Mali) began broadcasting from la maison de la Radio in the Bozola neighbourhood of Bamako.  Technical abilities were bolstered with Czech transmitters ranging from 18 to 30 kilowatts in 1962.\n\nIn 1970, the Chinese government constructed four 50 kW radio transmitters about 7 km from Bamako, towards Kati, enabling Radio Mali to reach much of West Africa. In 22 September 1983, a Libyan financed television broadcast centre was opened in Bamako, enabling RTM to broadcast one channel of colour television. French and German grant programmes between 1984 and 1990 enabled news and reporting to expand, with regional stations opening in Ségou (1986), Koulikoro (1989), Sikasso (1990) and Mopti (1993). In 1992, a second national broadcast radio network (Chiffre II) was added.\n\nOn 5 October 1992, the Malian government split off the RTM  according to \"Law 92-021\", from direct government control, becoming a publicly financed, independently run entity (an \"Établissement Public à Caractère Administratif (EPA)\"). This was part of the national liberalisation process, moving the nation to the \"Third Malian Republic\". Private broadcasters were legalised, and RTM was reorganised as the ORTM on 1 January 1993.\n\nORTM was seized by National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR) forces on 21 March 2012 as part of the 2012 Malian coup d'état. A thousand-person protest was held on 26 March, chanting \"Down with Sanogo\" and \"Liberate the ORTM\".\n\nCurrent output\nIn 2002, ORTM had 35 local radio and/or television broadcast points or repeaters, with TV/radio broadcast points in all eight Regions of Mali.  From its headquarters in Bamako, ORTM produces two radio networks (RTM and Chiffre II), a national television network (RTM), and directs the work of a number of regional RTM radio stations.\n\nConsidered one of the freest news markets in Africa, although government office holders threaten (and sometimes resort to) prosecution of broadcasters under Mali's strict anti-libel laws.  In 2001, the head of OTRM was threatened with jail after the government attempted to prosecute RTM for an interview in which the mayor of Bamako accused the Malian judiciary of corruption.  Since 1992, broadcasting is no longer a state monopoly.  There are two large private multi-channel television providers, and numerous private radio stations.  Mali is also considered a world leader in community radio development, with ORTM helping to set up the Union des Radios et Televisions Libres (URTEL) , a network of over a hundred independently locally operated stations.  OTRM also partners with other government and international organisations in education and development programs throughout Mali.\n\nProgramming\nRTM Radio and television broadcast news and information programming, light entertainment (both foreign and domestic), music and sport.  Most national broadcasts are in French, with several hours of Bambara language programming, as well as regional broadcasting in other languages. Emission Hebdomadaire d'Information, the weekly ORTM news magazine, has been broadcasting each Sunday at noon since 1998, and is anchored by Manga Dembélé and Youssouf Touré.  A daily news program is broadcast twice daily.  Chiffre II radio network is simulcast on the OTRM website, while television broadcasts are carried on regional satellite.  ORTM television regularly broadcasts local sport, mostly  Malien Première Division football matches, to an eager audience at least three days a week.\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral\n www.ortm.ml/ Office de radiodiffusion et de télévision du Mali.\n Pascal James Imperato,  Historical Dictionary Of Mali.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Andriza Mircovich\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Andriza (or Andrew) Mircovich (,  1879 – May 14, 1913) was an Austro-Hungarian national of Serb descent. He was the only prisoner ever to be executed by shooting in the US state of Nevada. He had been sentenced to death for the premeditated murder of John Gregovich in Tonopah, Nevada. Mircovich felt that he was owed more money from Gregovich's administration of his late cousin's estate and resorted to settling the matter by stabbing Gregovich to death.\n\nA 1911 statute was passed by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a death row inmate to opt to die by shooting or hanging; that statute was repealed in 1921. Mircovich was insistent on shooting, claiming that hanging often took too long. After the Nevada State Prison warden, George W. Cowing, was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution.\n\nBackground\n\nAndriza Mircovich was a 31-year-old miner and a recent immigrant to the US from Austria-Hungary. Mircovich spoke little English and was barely literate in his native Serbian dialect. His cousin Christopher Mircovich had died in a fire in the Tonopah Belmont Mine on February 23, 1911. Because Christopher did not have a will, his estate was turned over to Nye County public administrator Arthur H. Keenan. At the recommendation of District Attorney James A. Sanders, Andriza Mircovich and Christopher Mircovich's surviving siblings, Vasso and Maria, met with John Gregovich on May 10, 1911. Gregovich, who also went by the surname Greggory, was a fellow Serb from Castellastva, (now Petrovac), who was handling the cases of other Serbian miners who had died in the fire. Mircovich, who was unfamiliar with the probate laws in Nevada, began cursing Gregovich and Sanders because he was frustrated over being unable to take sole control of the estate.\n\nAt the time of his death, Christopher Mircovich's estate included $520 in cash, and a settlement of $2,000 from the Tonopah Belmont Company. On July 17, 1911, Gregovich issued a check for $50 to Andriza Mircovich, followed by another check for $1,742.50 to Vasso and Maria on July 22. $507.32 was added to the estate for money orders held in Christopher's name. After legal and administrative fees were paid, $966.25 in undisbursed funds remained in the estate. Mircovich believed that he was owed more money and his demands escalated into threats against Gregovich. On November 14, 1911, Gregovich petitioned District Judge Peter J. Sommers, to be released as executor of the estate. Feeling cheated, Mircovich vowed to take matters into his own hands. At that time, South Slavic immigrants traditionally settled disagreements in mining camps by the use of a knife.\n\nDeath of John Gregovich\n\nIn the early morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had a man called J. R. Masterson in conversation.  Mircovich had come to the depot from the cemetery to see who was arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, \"I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!\" He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00 p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he \"wanted to make John Gregovich die\", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.\n\nTrial and sentencing\n\nAt the grand jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case involved capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912, for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the \"manhood\" to \"defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people\" or else \"we might just as well dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as well take his Honor off the bench and say we have no law in Nye County.\"\n\nOn June 15, 1912, Mircovich was convicted of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death by Judge Averill. Mircovich boarded a train to Nevada State Prison in Carson City on June 17 while escorted by Sheriff Malley and prison warden George W. Cowing. Mircovich parted with the statement: \"They will treat me to a shower of cold lead.\" He became nauseated during the trip and begged his captors to shoot him right away, not understanding that attorneys would pursue appeals on his behalf.\n\nAttorney J.E. McNamara argued to the Nevada Supreme Court that Sanders unfairly prejudiced the jury with the statement: \"Why, gentlemen of the jury, if you cannot pronounce by your verdict the death penalty upon this defendant, I say, let's resurrect old Casey [that killed Mrs. Hislop in Goldfield] and let him live again.\" However, the appeal was denied and the lower court decision was upheld, with Justice Pat McCarran abstaining from the opinion.\n\nExecution\nNevada State Prison had been the state-designated facility for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich did not want to be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad.\n\nThe shooting machine\n\nThe state then ordered a rack of rifles that was to be set up on a frame by an Eastern ordnance foundry. The 1000-pound (450 kg) execution machine, which was called the \"shooting gallery of steel\", included three Savage Model 1899 .30-30 caliber rifles with Maxim silencers. When the device arrived at the prison, Cowing no longer wanted to have any part of the execution and resigned. Denver S. Dickerson, a former Nevada governor and prison reformer, was appointed as the new warden. On May 13, 1913, Prison Chaplain Lloyd B. Thomas of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Carson City, Nevada, made an unsuccessful appeal for commutation on Mircovich's behalf with the Board of Pardons.\n\nThe \"shooting machine\" was designed to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: \"I much obligated to you. You be good man to me.\" Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant's heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said \"I die like a soldier\" before he was shot to death.\n\nAftermath\n\nDoctor McLean declared that the death was instantaneous. An autopsy found the two soft-nosed ball cartridges within 2/3 inch (17mm) of each other in Mircovich's heart. Reverend Thomas conducted an informal service at the prison cemetery that afternoon. Mircovich's body was buried in a pine coffin on the same day.\n\nIn a 1915 report to the Nevada Legislature, Dickerson stated that despite his personal reservations, \"executions by shooting are a trifle less barbarous than by hanging and have the further merit of eliminating many of the possibilities of bungling.\" However, the shooting machine was never used again and was placed in storage by the prison quarry. In July 1942, it was donated with 50 tons of scrap metal for a collection drive during World War II. The rifles from the machine were found during an inventory of the prison armory in June 1977 and were donated to the Nevada State Museum in Carson City.\n\nSee also\n\nCapital punishment in Nevada\nCapital punishment in the United States\nGee Jon\nMiranda warning\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n Nevada State Prison Inmate Case Files: Andriza Mircovich at Nevada State Library and Archives\n State of Nevada v.

Southampton was a strategic bombing target for the Luftwaffe as it contained both busy docks with associated business premises and factories and the Supermarine factory building Spitfires in Woolston. Being a large port city on the south coast it was within easy reach of German airfields in France.\n\nDuring the war, 57 attacks on the city were made, but over 1,500 air raid warnings were issued. According to the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Department approximately 2,300 bombs were dropped amounting to over 470 tonnes of high explosives. Over 30,000 incendiary devices were dropped on the city with nearly 45,000 buildings damaged or destroyed, with most of the city's High Street being hit.\n\nSpitfire factory\n\nThe Supermarine factory building making Spitfires in Woolston was a key target in the city. On 24 and 26 September 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked the riverside factory during two day-time raids. Much of the factory was destroyed and 110 people were killed. Northam gasworks was also targeted on 26 September and 11 workers were killed in the raid.\n\nCivic Centre\n\nA daylight raid on 6 November 1940 targeted the city's Civic Centre. Hermann Goering, head of the Luftwaffe, had remarked that the Civic Centre appeared like a \"piece of cake\" from the air, and that he was going to \"cut himself a slice\". During the raid twelve bombs were dropped, including a direct hit on the Civic Centre with a 500lb high explosive. The bomb penetrated to the lower floors of the art gallery killing 35 people, including 15 children, who were having an art lesson in the basement.\n\nBlitz\n\nOf the 57 air raids, by far the worst were on 23 and 30 November and 1 December 1940 and these attacks are generally referred to as \"Southampton's Blitz\". Starting at 18:15, or 6:15 P.M, and running until midnight on the evening of 23 November, 77 people were killed and over 300 injured with the Civic Centre taking much of the brunt of the attack. The scale of the raid ruined the city's water supply and many of the fires had to be left to burn themselves out.\n\nThere were reports that the glow of the firestorm of Southampton burning could be seen from as far away as Cherbourg on the coast of France. Nazi publicity declared in propaganda that the city had been left a smoking ruin.\n\nA week later, 120 German bombers returned for a further six-hour attack on the evening of 30 November. 800 bombs dropped on the city left 137 dead, 96 killed in their air raid shelters. Major buildings including Pirelli Cable Works, the Daily Echo newspaper building and the General Motors factory were severely damaged or destroyed. All Saints', Holyrood and St. Mary's churches, were destroyed, although St. Michael's escaped with only minor damage, allegedly because the spire was used by the German bombers as a landmark and their pilots were ordered not to hit it. Altogether, Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes.\n\nThe last casualties of air raids in the city were in a small raid on the suburbs of the city in May 1941 and on 8 July 1941 in the area of Victory Crescent, Millbrook, killing three people. The last major raid of over 50 bombers was in June 1942. There were occasional tip and run raids and in 1944 two V1 flying bombs in mid-July were the last enemy ordnance to fall in the city.\n\nVictims\nAmong the victims of the bombing was Edgar L. Perry, who had worked as a coal trimmer on board the RMS Titanic in 1912. Perry, who had survived the sinking, perished along with his wife on 23 November 1940 as they sought shelter from the bombing.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nBBC People's War - One child's memories of the Southampton Blitz\nBBC People's War - getting bombed when home on leave\nSoton Blitz on Plimsoll.org\nMapping the Southampton Blitz 70 years on - Ordnance Survey\n\nHistory of Southampton\nSouthampton\nThe Blitz\n20th century in Hampshire\n20th century in Southampton", "machine_text": " The Southampton Blitz was the bombing of the English port city of Southampton during World War II by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe). The blitz began on the night of 23 November 1940, and continued for a total of three days and two nights. The attack was part of the Luftwaffe's strategic bombing campaign over Britain, known as the Battle of Britain. This attack was part of a Luftwaffe plan to destroy Britain's war production factories in the major port cities. Southampton was an important strategic target due to its role as a major naval supply base and a centre for aircraft production. In addition, it was an important docking point for the motorized landing craft used in the invasion of Europe. The initial attack on Southampton began with a series of wave raids lasting several hours. German aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, fracturing water mains, and destroying millions of pounds worth of property. On the first day alone, over 800 people were killed and 8,000 properties were destroyed or damaged. In response to the Blitz, the British government established many food ration programs to help the citizens of Southampton cope. On 29 December 1940, the Southampton Blitz Relief Fund was established to compensate those who had lost their homes or businesses. In addition to the monetary contributions from the British government, the citizens of Southampton also launched their own initiatives. The local newspaper, the Southampton Times, ran a campaign for donations. A \"Gift week\" was held in January 1941, during which local churches and businesses encouraged citizens to donate money and goods to their neighbours affected by the bombing. Despite all the efforts of the British government and citizens of Southampton, the casualties resulting from the Blitz were devastating. 1,655 were killed and 2,935 were seriously injured. Additionally, 150,000 people were left homeless. The last significant raid occurred on the night of 3 May 1941, when the Luftwaffe launched a heavy attack on the city. After that night, there were only smaller scale, sporadic raids on Southampton, the bombings of which resulted in comparatively fewer casualties. The effects of the Southampton Blitz have been long felt by the citizens and remain visible even today in the bombed-out buildings and neighbourhoods. However, it is widely acknowledged that the city's response to the attack, both in terms of their aid programs and the spirit of volunteers who pitched in to help, showed great civic duty and commendable resilience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7453117}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Kim Jong-suk\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Kim Jong-suk (; 24 December 1917  – 22 September 1949) was a Korean anti-Japanese guerrilla, a Communist activist, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung's first wife, former leader Kim Jong-il's mother, and current leader Kim Jong-un's grandmother.\n\nBiography\nKim Jong-suk was born on 24 December 1917 in Hoeryong County, North Hamgyong Province, Japanese Korea. Suh Dae-sook writes that she was \"the elder of two daughters of a poor farmer.\" However, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), states that she had a younger brother, Kim Ki-song(김기송), who was born 9 February 1921.\n\nKim Jong-suk followed her mother to Manchuria to look for her father, but they discovered that he had already died there. Soon after that, her mother died and she became an orphan. Most sources agree that Kim Jong-suk then joined Kim Il-sung’s guerrilla force in 1935 or 1936 as a kitchen helper.  The KCNA, however, reports that Kim Jong-suk and Kim Ki-song joined the guerrilla forces after their mother and their elder brother’s wife were murdered by the Japanese.\n\nDuring this time, Kim Jong-suk worked various odd jobs, was arrested by the Japanese in 1937 in an undercover attempt to secure food and supplies. After her release, she rejoined the guerrillas, where she cooked, sewed, and washed.\n\nIt was around this time that Kim Jong-suk reportedly saved Kim Il-sung’s life. Baik Bong relates the story in Kim Il-sung's official biography:\n\nKim Jong-suk married Kim Il Sung in the Soviet Union, most likely in 1941. On 16 February 1941 (or 1942, sources vary), in the Soviet village of Vyatskoye, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Jong-il, who was given the Russian name \"Yuri Irsenovich Kim,\" and the nickname \"Yura.\" In 1944, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Man-il, in Korean and \"Alexander\" or \"Shura\" in Russian. In 1946, she gave birth to a daughter, Kim Kyŏng-hŭi. Augustina Vardugina, a woman from Vyatskoye, was in her teens when Kim Il-sung's guerrilla group camped there. She remembers Kim Jong-suk, and how she would come to the village to barter military rations for chicken and eggs. Her son, Kim Jong-il, would be holding her hand.\n\nA year after the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and until her death, Kim Jong-suk was the first lady of North Korea. According to some accounts, Kim Jong-suk \"was a small, quiet woman, not particularly well educated, but friendly and life-loving.\" Major General N.G. Lebedev, an executive Soviet officer during the Soviet occupation of North Korea, recalled Kim Jong-suk as \"a vivacious and generous lady who always cooked enormous amounts of food for the hungry Soviet generals when they visited Kim’s home.\"\n\nDeath\n\nKim Jong-suk died in Pyongyang in 1949. The official story is that she died from \"the hardships she had endured during the years as a guerrilla fighter.\" The unofficial story is that she died in childbirth while delivering a stillborn child. Her death, however, is omitted from her official biography. Some say she died from tuberculosis, and there are other stories that she was shot and bled to death.\n\nLegacy\nAfter Kim Jong-il succeeded Kim Il Sung, he began to make his mother, Kim Jong-suk, into \"a revolutionary immortal.\" This campaign created \"a holy trinity known as the ‘Three Generals.’\" Instead of touting Kim Jong-suk as the quiet woman that she was, she became the heroine of the revolution. The website of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) says she was \"a peerless heroine . . . an anti-Japanese heroine . . . a faithful retainer who faithfully carried out General Kim Il Sung’s [Kim Il-sung] will but also a lifeguard who safeguarded the General of every dangerous movement.\"\n\nKim Jong-suk was recorded to have \"conducted on-the-spot guidance sessions\" and was a \"great strategist\". In her home town of Hoeryong, \"a museum, a library, a statue, a square and the house in which she was born\" are \"devoted to the 'Mother of Korea'\". She arranged parachute training and won several shooting competitions. One story says that she would wash Kim Il-sung's socks and dry them in her bosom, or cut her hair and spread it in Kim Il-sung's shoes.\n\nMichael Harrold, in his memoir Comrades and Strangers, relates several stories he heard about Kim Jong-suk while in North Korea. According to him, there is a memorial near Mount Kumgang that marks where Kim Jong-suk stopped \"when she realized she had forgotten to bring the great leader’s lunch, and had turned back to prepare something to eat for when he returned from the mountains.\" Kim Jong-suk is also credited with inspiring Kim Jong-il to build the Ryugyong Hotel. Harrold relates that Kim Jong-suk told a young Kim Jong-il that he \"must build tall buildings for the people, of 30 or even 40 stories,\" and the son replied that he would build housing 100 stories high. This led to the construction of the 105-story Ryugyong Hotel, which is still not opened.\n\nOn 1 June 2015, the Daily NK reported that Kim Jong-suk's wedding ring had gone missing from Pyongyang's Korean Revolution Museum sometime in late May. Items belonging to key figures of the Kim family are of great importance. In 2010, state television aired a show dedicated to the story behind the ring, which was, purportedly, given to her by Kim Il-sung in 1938 for her role in the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement.\n\nMany places in North Korea are named after her, including Kimjongsuk County, Kim Jong-suk Naval Academy, Kim Jong-suk Teacher Training College, Kim Jong-suk Rest Home, and Kim Jong-suk Pyongyang Silk Mill.\n\nIn North Korean News\n\nIn North Korean News The KCNA regularly reports on Kim Jong-suk, either honoring her memory or describing her revolutionary activities. The following are headlines from articles relating to Kim Jong-suk from 2012:\n\nNational Meeting on International Women's Day Held: \"Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese war hero, upheld the original idea and policy of Kim Il Sung and performed distinguished feats in the development of the movement for women's emancipation in Korea.\" (8 March 2012)\nWax Replica of Kim Jong Suk Displayed: \"A hall housing a wax replica of the anti-Japanese war hero, Kim Jong Suk, was opened at the International Friendship Exhibition House in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tuesday.\" (26 April 2012)\nWax sculpture dedicated to great woman: \"She carried out secret political tasks assigned by Kim Il Sung\" and \"She brought up Kim Jong Il as the Shining Star of Mt.

Born in the Heungnam region of the Hamgyong province in Korea, Kim was considered to be a loyal follower of her husband and leader of the North Korean Worker's Party, Kim Il-sung. A product of the Japanese colonization of Korea, Kim was deeply opposed to the Japanese occupation and organized guerrilla groups to fight against them. She was also an active member of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, and greatly contributed to the North Korean independence movement. Kim's most prominent contribution to the North Korean cause was becoming an active member in the guerrilla movement against the Japanese rule. During this time, she became the leader of the Changso Faction, a division of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, and led several successful attacks against Japanese forces. Kim also assisted in underground education and in the transportation of participants in the struggle for independence. In 1946, she was inducted into the Politburo at the first party conference, a feat which was made possible due to her many attempts at revolutionizing the country. After the end of the Japanese occupation, Kim continued to actively participate in the struggle towards a communist state in North Korea. She encouraged the organization of farmers, trained guerrilla units, and was a central figure in the establishment of the Social Democratic Women's Union. She was highly respected due to her diligent efforts, and people referred to her as \"The Nation's Mother.\" In 1949, Kim gave birth to her first son, Kim Jong-il, making her the mother of the future North Korean \"dear leader\" Kim Jong-il. After the birth of her son, Kim was struck with cerebro-vascular disease, and she died at the age of thirty in September 1949. Since her death, Kim Jong-suk has been honored by the North Korean government as a hero of the North Korean independence movement. Her image can still be seen around North Korea today, including in the documentary film Sea of Blood, which depicts her involvement in the independence struggle. In addition, she was honored posthumously in 1977 when her portrait was hung in the Supreme People's Assembly, and the Kim Jong-suk Medal was established in her name. Kim Jong-suk will always remain a figure of prominence and admiration in North Korean history. She was a brave and hardworking individual who dedicated her life to the struggle for independence and worked tirelessly to ensure the liberation of North Korea. She will be remembered as an icon of liberation and a symbol of selflessness for generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2782697}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ice cream\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.  Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below ). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\n\nThe meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another.\n Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk.\n Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir.\n Frozen custard, with eggs added to cream and sugar.\n Ice milk.\n Sorbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base. Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea.\n Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,  almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\n\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history.\nSome sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine. Although sorbets are believed to have been invented in Persia, other accounts say ice cream originated in the Mongol Empire and first spread to China during its expansion.\n\nIts spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of it during his travels to China. The Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the \"frozen snow\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support any of these legends.\n\nSnow was used to cool drinks in Greece around 500 BC and Hippocrates is known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing \"fluxes of the stomach\". Snow collected from the lower slopes of mountains was unsanitary and iced drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of other ailments. Seneca criticized the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts in an era without refrigeration.\n\nDespite this, ice and snow were prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice. There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour, camphor and water buffalo milk and recipes for snow-chilled sweets are included in a 1st-century Roman recipe book. There are Persian records from the 2nd century AD for sweetened chilled drinks with ice made by freezing water in the desert at night.\n\nIce cream was made possible only by the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could only be chilled but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that lowered the melting point of ice, which had the effect of drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze. The first known record of this comes from the Indian poem Pancatantra, dating to the 4th century AD. The earliest written description of the process is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Ibn Abu Usaybia concerning medicine. The technique of \"freezing\" is not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.\n\nSouth Asia \n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital Delhi. The ice was used in fruit sorbets. It was also used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\"\n\nEurope \n\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.\n\nIce cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century. The recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718.\n\nTo ice cream.\n\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten’d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and  lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou’d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten’d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\n\nThe 1751 edition of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse includes a recipe for ice cream: \"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\"\n\nThe year 1768 saw the publication of L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.\n\nNorth America \n\nAn early North American reference to ice cream is from 1744: \"Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.\"\n\nQuaker colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18-step recipe for ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.\n\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.\n\nThe most popular flavours of ice cream in North America (based on consumer surveys) are vanilla and chocolate.\n\nExpansion in popularity \nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-eighteenth century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss émigré Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\n\nIn New Zealand, a newspaper advertisement for ice cream appeared in 1866, claiming to be the first time ice cream was available in Wellington. Commercial manufacturing was underway in 1875. Ice cream rapidly gained in popularity in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. By 2018, exported ice cream products included new flavors such as “matcha” to cater specifically to Asian markets.\n\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \"queen of ices\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books:  The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\n\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\n\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery of 1888. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\". The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\n\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors\", and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.\n\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \"premium\" and \"super-premium\" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and Häagen-Dazs.\n\nComposition \nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture. Too much lactose will result in a non ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.\n\nProduction \n\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a  (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\n\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\n\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings. It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of  cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.\n\nRetail sales \n\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, the US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.\n\nSpecialty job \n\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"ice cream trucks\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"Turkey in the Straw\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\n\nIngredients and standard quality definitions \n\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\n\nIn the U.S., the FDA rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:\n greater than 10% milk fat\n 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk\n\nIt generally also has:\n 12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners\n 0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers\n 55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.\n\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.\nEven the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains  per half-cup due to its high sugar content.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, ice cream in Canada is divided into  Ice cream mix and Ice cream. Each have a different set of regulations.\n Ice cream must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per litre. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.\n The ice cream mix is defined as the pasteurized mix of cream, milk and other milk products that are not yet frozen. It may contain eggs, artificial or non-artificial flavours, cocoa or chocolate syrup, a food colour, an agent that adjusts the pH level in the mix, salt, a stabilizing agent that doesn't exceed 0.5% of the ice cream mix, a sequestering agent which preserves the food colour, edible casein that doesn't exceed 1% of the mix, propylene glycol mono fatty acids in an amount that will not exceed 0.35% of the ice cream mix, and sorbitan tristearate in an amount that will not exceed 0.035% of the mix. The ice cream mix may not include less than 36% solid components.\n\nPhysical properties \n\nIce cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.\n\nOstwald ripening \n\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\n\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).\n\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.\n\nFood safety concerns \nFrom the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases, weight gain, and other metabolic syndromes.\n\nAround the world \n\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\n\nThe most traditional Argentine helado (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.\n\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year.\n\nIn China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.\n\nIn 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafés opened in Paris.\n\nIn Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or pagotó (), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIndia is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.\n\nIn Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called es puter or \"stirred ice cream\" is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar—and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.\n\nIn Iran, fālūde (Persian: فالوده) or pālūde (Persian: پالوده) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.\n\nItalian ice cream, or gelato as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \"produzione propria\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\n\nSorbetes is a Philippine version of common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name sorbetes and sorbet, sorbetes is not a type of sorbet.\n\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many cafés or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafés may also sell flavours like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu.\n\nDondurma is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).\n\nIn the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \"Philadelphia style\" ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \"French ice cream\". American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year—the most in the world.\n\nCones \n\nMrs A.B.Marshall's Cookery Book, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones, but the idea predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\n\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.\n\nOther frozen desserts \n\nThe following is a partial list of ice creamy frozen desserts and snacks:\n\n Ais kacang: a dessert in Malaysia and Singapore made from shaved ice, syrup, and boiled red bean and topped with evaporated milk\n Booza: an elastic, sticky, high-level melt resistant ice cream\n Dondurma: Turkish ice cream, made of salep and mastic resin\n Frozen custard: at least 10% milk fat, at least 1.4% egg yolk and much less air beaten into it, similar to Gelato, fairly rare; known in Italy as Semifreddo\n Frozen yogurt: made with yogurt instead of milk or cream, it has a tart flavour and lower fat content\n Gelato: an Italian frozen dessert having a lower milk fat content than ice cream\n Halo-halo: a popular Filipino dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a tall glass or bowl\n Ice cream sandwich: two (usually) soft biscuits, cookies or cake sandwiching a bar of ice cream\n Ice milk: less than 10% milk fat and lower sweetening content, once marketed as \"ice milk\" but now sold as low-fat ice cream in the United States\n Ice pop or ice lolly: frozen fruit puree, fruit juice, or flavoured sugar water on a stick or in a flexible plastic sleeve\n Kulfi: believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent during Mughal India\n Maple toffee: Also known as maple taffy. A popular springtime treat in maple-growing areas is maple toffee, where maple syrup boiled to a concentrated state is poured over fresh snow congealing in a toffee-like mass, and then eaten from a wooden stick used to pick it up from the snow\n Mellorine: non-dairy, with vegetable fat substituted for milk fat\n Parevine: Kosher non-dairy frozen dessert established in 1969 in New York\n Patbingsu: A popular Korean shaved ice dessert commonly served with sweet toppings such as fruit, red bean, or sweetened condensed milk\n Sherbet: 1–2% milk fat and sweeter than ice cream\n Sorbet: fruit puree with no dairy products\n Snow cones: made from balls of crushed ice topped with flavoured syrup served in a paper cone\n\nCryogenics \n\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.\n\nSee also \n\n Cold-stimulus headache\n Ice cream social\n List of dairy products\n List of desserts\n List of ice cream brands\n List of ice cream flavors\n Milkshake (a blended mix of ice cream, milk and syrups)\n Nancy Maria Donaldson Johnson\n Soft serve\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n How It's Made: UConn Dairy Bar Ice Cream\n Selected Internet Resources – Ice Cream / Science Reference Section, Library of Congress\n\n \nDairy products\nDesserts\nTypes of food\nFrozen desserts\nWorld cuisine\nIndependence Day (United States) foods", "machine_text": " Ice cream, or often referred to as “froyo” (freeze yogurt) is a sweet confectionery product. It is usually made of dairy products, such as cream or milk, along with sugar and flavorings, then frozen into a soft, creamy dessert. It comes in a variety of flavors, such as vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate, and can be eaten alone or as a topping for other desserts, such as cakes and pies. As far back as 2000 BCE, in ancient Asia, thickened milk was frozen and served as a dessert. During the time of the ancient Greeks, crushed ice was combined with honey to make a dessert. The first known written record of a type of frozen confectionery is found in a ninth-century Chinese text. In Europe, ice cream was made with cream and sugar in the sixteenth century. Later, other ingredients such as fruits, cocoa, and chocolate were added to make different flavors. In 1660 an ice maker from France named Nicolas Procopé introduced \"sorbet,\" a kind of water-based ice cream. In the united states, the development of ice cream has been largely credited to an American inventor, Jacob Fussell, who in 1851 opened the world's first commercial ice cream factory in Baltimore, Maryland. It was soon followed by companies such as Petersen & Brug in Philadelphia and Bradley & Hazard in Providence, Rhode Island. Presently, ice cream is popular world-wide, with the United States consuming 18.5 quarts of ice cream per capita each year. The global ice cream market is projected to grow significantly (at a CAGR of 7% to 8%) during the forecast period of 2020 to 2027, due to rising disposable income and the inclination of consumers towards desserts and confectionary products. Furthermore, the growing popularity of plant-based ice cream is creating new opportunities in the market, as veganism is becoming more prevalent. Today, there are many different types of ice cream available, including dairy-free, lactose-free, low-fat, and organic ice creams. Some of the most popular flavors include vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream, mint chip, and rocky road. Ice cream can also be served in a variety of ways such as in cones, cups, sundaes, shakes, and smoothies. It is a popular dessert that can be enjoyed at any time of the year. Whether eaten as a dessert after a meal, as an afternoon snack, or even as a treat on a hot summer day, ice cream is sure to delight.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48212}

Afflick received a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University in 1971, and has worked and taught in both the United States and Canada for over fifty years. Afflick is best known for his books Race and Social Problems (1988) and Reconstructing Social Problems (1994). In these books, he examines racial and social issues using an interdisciplinary approach, often involving references to literature, sociology, philosophy, history, and economics. He uses this interdisciplinary approach to explore the concept of 'race' and examine our understanding of a racial hierarchy. His goal is to challenge assumptions and to move beyond the traditional boundaries of social science research. In Race and Social Problems, Afflick sets out to explore the relationship between 'race' and social problems, looking at how these problems have evolved over time, how they are shaped by the power of society, and what can be done to address them. He argues for a more nuanced understanding of social problems, and calls for a shift from racially-based solutions to ones that take into account the related issues of class, gender, and other social distinctions. Afflick also emphasizes the need for reflection and action in the areas of racial and social justice. He encourages readers to consider the shortcomings of traditional social theories, and to think critically about structural inequities that exist in society. Moreover, he argues for a more holistic approach to social problems, recognizing that any solutions must involve ongoing dialogue, action, and education. In addition to his books, Afflick is a frequent contributor to journals and magazines, and he has been published in newspapers such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal. He is also a sought-after public speaker, delivering lectures and workshops at universities and conferences. Throughout his career, Afflick has been a strong advocate for social and racial justice. He believes that change can be achieved through direct action and education, and through creating dialogue and developing meaningful partnerships with people of other backgrounds. His work has been widely praised, and his contributions to the field of sociology and social justice continue to inspire students, activists, and scholars around the world.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22169346}

Its name derives from Dayton Street, one of Flint's most crime-ridden streets.\n\nMusical career\n\nEarly history (1993–2005)\nIn 1993, Ira Dorsey and Raheen Peterson met through their younger brothers. The two began writing together, under the names Bootleg and Shoestring, and created their first song, \"Dope Dayton Ave\". Rapper Matt Hinkle soon joined the duo under the name Backstabba. The group began working with local producer Steve Pitts and formed The Dayton Family, named after Dayton Avenue, one of the most crime-ridden streets in their hometown of Flint, Michigan. In between studio sessions, they performed at local clubs and quickly gain notoriety within Flint.\n\nThe Dayton Family recorded a 12-inch single and soon signed with Atlanta independent record label Po' Broke in 1995. That year, the group released their debut album What's on My Mind? and were featured on No Limits Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin' compilation album, which got the trio recognition throughout Southern United States. After the album's release, Hinkle was imprisoned and replaced by Bootleg's younger brother Erick, who performed under the name Ghetto-E. Following a year of touring, the group left Po' Broke due to legal problems with the label's producer and signed with Russ Entertainment .\n\nIn 1996, they released their second album F.B.I., standing for Fuck Being Indicted, under Russ Entertainment/Relativity Records. The Dayton Family was plagued with various legal problems, including Ira being incarcerated soon after release of F.B.I., which hindered the amount of work the group released. In 1999, both Ira and Peterson released solo albums. Two years later, the group signed with Detroit rapper Esham's Gothom label and released solo albums. The next year, they released Welcome to the Dopehouse under Koch Records.\n\nStabilization (2005-2010)\nAfter a three-year hiatus, the group was trimmed down to Ira and Peterson and they released Family Feud through Fast Life Records. The following year, The Dayton Family signed with U Be U Records and released Back on Dayton Ave. The duo added new member Jake the Flake later that same year and released Return to Dayton Ave. in October. Following Hinkle's release from prison, the group returned to their original lineup of Ira, Peterson, and Hinkle. In 2009, they released The Return: The Right to Remain Silent under DDA Records.\n\nHatchet House (2010-2011)\nOn July 14, 2010, The Dayton Family signed with Insane Clown Posse's subsidiary label Hatchet House.

The video for \"The Psypher (Part 1 & 2)\" was released on June 5, 2011.\n\nStyle and influences\nThe Dayton Family is known for their gritty lyrics concerning ghetto survival, struggle and poverty. AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier describes The Dayton Family's musical style as \"potent hardcore rap\". He says that the group has \"an idiosyncratic identity\" and \"a dark, grim mentality focused on modest survival rather than riches or fame\".

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.\n\nHistory\n\nThe flats were built in 1888–89 for the 1st Duke of Westminster. Their building was supervised by the Duke's nephew and agent, Cecil Parker, and named after him. They were intended for the Duke's employees when they retired from working for him on his Eaton Hall estate. They were designed by the Chester firm of architects Douglas & Fordham and based on flats being built for the working-class in London. To this end Douglas was sent to study the Stalbridge Buildings in London which were being developed by the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company. Douglas' relationship with Parker was never harmonious, and when the block of flats was completed, Parker complained about \"poor materials and workmanship\". The building still stands and continues to be used as flats, having been refurbished in 1982 by S. J. Lomas for the Northern Counties Housing Association. Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, states that this design is a \"rare departure from his usual building types\".\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe building is constructed in common brick, with dressings in red Ruabon brick, and diapering in blue brick. It comprises 30 flats in three storeys. The south side of the building, facing Foregate Street, has three asymmetrical bays. The middle bay contains an open basket arch in each storey. On the ground floor the arch forms an entrance porch; on the upper floors the arches form balconies with wrought iron railings. At the top is a gable with three ball finials. Over the entrance arch is a stone panel inscribed with the date 1889 and \"Parker's Buildings\". On each floor is a three-light window in the left bay, and a one-light window at a lower level in the right bay. The flats stretch behind this front, with five flats to each storey on each side. Around the building, between the ground and first floor is a string course, and between the upper storeys is a corbel table. Tall brick chimneys rose from the roof. The stairways on the sides are exposed to the exterior, but are contained within the building.\n\nParker's Buildings is set back from the street. The approach is flanked by two three-storey buildings designed by Douglas and Fordham. Each includes a shop at ground level and above this the buildings are in red brick with blue diapering, stone dressings and shaped gables.

The buildings were built in the second half of the 19th century and are believed to be named after a local builder, Henry Parker. The buildings consist of two single storey terraces facing Handbridge Park and two larger two storey terraces facing Regent Street. They are constructed with red brick and stone detailing, with round arched door and window openings. Although there are some minor alterations, the terraces largely survived intact. The buildings were listed Grade II in 1982 in recognition of their special architectural or historic interest. The listing covers all six of the buildings in the group, their walls, including the railings, and their piers, gates and gate piers. They are described as mid-Victorian terraces with brick walls and cast iron railings. The terraces form part of the Handbridge Conservation Area, and are considered to be of great architectural and historical significance. They make a significant contribution to the special character and appearance of the area. Parker's Buildings is a popular local tourist attraction, drawing visitors to the area to experience the ambience and the architectural features of the area. The houses remain in use to this day, and their charming details are a local asset. The Parkers Buildings area is home to a number of businesses including a cafe and a pub. Residents of the area can enjoy the benefits of a number of local amenities, including shops, restaurants, pubs, and parks. There are also many popular tourist attractions nearby, such as the Roman amphitheatre and the historic city walls.

The show was created by director Pascal Caucheteux and screenwriter Michel Hazanavicius, and directed by Hazanavicius and Thierry Binisti. The show is both a comedy and a drama, and its main protagonist is seventeen-year-old Simon, a young man living in a sleepy small town called Romilly “Le Haut”. The story centers on Simon’s developing relationship with his neighbor, Soledad, as he attempts to move forward in his life, dealing with issues such as loneliness, unrequited love, and adolescent identity issues. The show stars Alexandre Stanké as Simon, Paz Vega as Soledad and Joana Preiss in a guest role as the substitute teacher. Simon deals with themes commonly encountered by youth growing up and is recognized for its realism by observers. However, the show, described by some as a French version of Freaks and Geeks, is not without its lighter moments. The show features occasional flashback sequences and explores the phrase “Everyone has a story to tell” by breaking down the fourth wall on multiple occasions and allowing the characters to speak directly to the audience about their experiences. The show was a critical success, earning numerous awards and nominations, including several Grimme-Preis awards. In 2011, the show was released on DVD with two extra episodes, “Le Petit Tambour” and “La Révélation”. In 2015, a follow-up series, La Jeunesse de Simon, was released, showing the characters five years later.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mnesia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Mnesia is a distributed, soft real-time database management system written in the Erlang programming language.  It is distributed as part of the Open Telecom Platform.\n\nDescription \nAs with Erlang, Mnesia was developed by Ericsson for soft real-time distributed and high-availability computing work related to telecoms. It was not intended as a general office-based data processing database management system, nor to replace SQL-based systems. Instead Mnesia exists to support Erlang, where DBMS-like persistence is required. It has more in common with embeddable DBMS such as Berkeley DB than with any SQL database server.\n\nDatabase model \n\"Rows\" in tables are represented as records that contain a key value and a data field. This data field may in turn be a tuple containing an Erlang data structure of any complexity.\n\nBackend types \nMnesia has three inbuilt table types: ram_copies, disc_copies and disc_only_copies.\n\nRam_copies \nData resides in memory and table size is limited by available memory and are backed by ETS (erlang term storage) table.\n\nDisc_copies \nData resides in memory but is also persisted on disk backed by disk_log. Disc_copies were backed by Dets tables until 30th September 2001 with the release of R7B-4.\n\nDisc_only_copies \nData resides only on disc and are backed by Dets (disk version of ETS). Dets file format uses signed 32-bit integers for file offsets and has a limit of 2GB so do disc_only_copies.\n\nBackend plugins \nDue to limits imposed by Dets, support for other backend plugins was suggested by Ulf Wiger and these were added to Mnesia. Klarna added the LevelDB backend plugin while Aeternity added the RocksDB backend plugin.\n\nRelational features \nThe database model is relational, but isn't what someone familiar with SQL might expect. A database contains tables. Relationships between them are modelled as other tables.\n\nA key feature of Mnesia's high-availability approach is that tables can be reconfigured within a schema and relocated between nodes, not only while the database is still running, but even while write operations are still going on.\n\nCoding  \nThe query language of Mnesia is Erlang itself, rather than SQL. It permits easy representation of transactions as a natural feature of Erlang by allowing developers to utilize a single language throughout an application.\n\nTransactions \nErlang is a functional language. Mnesia builds on this to obtain ACID transaction support. The functional block which is run as a transaction is a commonplace Erlang construct called a Functional Object (or Fun) and is called by the single Mnesia statement mnesia:transaction(F). This can lead to clearer source code than the paired BEGIN / COMMIT syntax of SQL, and so avoids its problem of unclosed transactions within a procedure.\n\nAgain as a result of the functional nature of Erlang, nesting transactions is simple. It's also possible to distribute transactions across multiple nodes (i.e. separate servers). The semantics of using transactions in this way remains consistent, making it easy to write library code that works equally in either context.\n\nGeneral coding style for Mnesia will always use transactions. For performance reasons, it also supports deliberate \"dirty operations\" which avoid transactions. These compromise the atomicity and the isolation properties of ACID, but offer around 10× more throughput. In addition there are also in-memory alternatives, although these lose the durability property of ACID.\n\nEfficient execution \nMnesia forms part of the LYME web application stack. This is akin to LAMP, but based on Erlang. Implementation in Erlang confers an efficiency benefit because of the use of a single virtual machine throughout an application. LYME makes use of this, since the Yaws web server is also implemented in Erlang.\n\nAddress space is shared (although safely so, under Erlang) between code and data, including Mnesia's table data.\n\nOrigins and licensing \nMnesia and Erlang were developed by the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. They have been released as open source software. Mnesia is released under a derivative of the Mozilla Public License. Since OTP 18.0 they are published according to the open source Apache License 2.0. Versions before OTP 18.0 were published under the open source Erlang Public License.\n\nejabberd \nMnesia is also an option embedded within the Erlang-based Jabber daemon, ejabberd.\n\nSee also \n\n Riak\n Apache Cassandra\n Couchbase\n CouchDB\n LYME (software bundle)\n\nReferences \n\nErlang (programming language)\nFree database management systems\nStructured storage", "machine_text": " Mnesia is an open source, distributed, real-time, multi-platform database used in telecom, industrial automation, and embedded systems. It is the core database of the Erlang language and its runtime system, which is used in many mission-critical projects worldwide. Mnesia is often used to store data associated with telecom networks, such as facilities that enable call set-up, call routing and authentication. It can also be used to store data associated with industrial automation. Mnesia is an ACID-compliant distributed database that follows the concept of master-slave replication, also known as transaction replication. It consists of one or more central servers that are directly accessible by the user, and one or more additional servers that synchronize with the master server. The schema, transactions, and data are replicated to all slaves, including those nodes added in the future. Mnesia facilitates the distribution of data across several nodes, enabling high availability and scalability. It is fault-tolerant, meaning it can recover from failures in the system. It provides an event-notification mechanism that can detect changes to data and fire actions associated with them. Mnesia offers features such as synchronous replication, persistence and fault tolerance, allowing it to maintain high performance and continuous availability in all cases. By using global transactions, application developers can create distributed system applications that can be monitored and managed on a single node. Moreover, Mnesia provides an advanced data-modeling mechanism that allows developers to quickly get started and build powerful, fault-tolerant applications. It also supports an ever-growing set of libraries and tools to ensure the RDBMS-style development process remains easy and effective. Applications built on this platform enjoy low maintenance costs, while still providing consistent data access. Mnesia is an ideal platform for mission-critical applications due to its superior performance, scalability and high availability. Its active development and open-source nature provide an ever-evolving platform to meet the needs of any organization.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6527837}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lisburn Road\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lisburn Road is a main arterial route linking Belfast and Lisburn, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Lisburn Road is now an extension of the \"Golden Mile\" with many shops, boutiques, wine bars, restaurants and coffee houses. The road runs almost parallel to the Malone Road, the two being joined by many side roads. It is a busy traffic route without much strong architectural character. Most of the housing is made up of red-brick terraces, some with alterations. Some buildings along the road, however, are considered to be architecturally important and interesting.\n\nLisburn Road itself begins at the nearby Bradbury Place and runs to Balmoral Avenue, beyond which it becomes Upper Lisburn Road. The Upper Lisburn Road extends south to reach Finaghy, at which point it becomes Kingsway and then in Dunmurry it becomes Queensway, before finally becoming the Belfast Road in Lisburn.\n\nHistory\nThe first record of the development of the Lisburn Road was when a property developer offered land for development 'West of the Lisburn Road' on 6 April 1813. His advert was placed in The News Letter on that date. The track that initially existed here developed and expanded, until pressure grew for a faster turnpike road to Dublin, to avoid the Malone Road hills and valleys. During 1817–1819 this road improvement scheme was implemented. The post office and toll booth stood, conveniently, at Shaftesbury Square, and presumably served both turnpike roads. At the top of Tate's Avenue, on the Lisburn Road side of the junction a second booth was in existence in 1857. One year later the toll business was abandoned, as the trains had taken over. Shopping habits have changed and the shopping population has moved from Shaftesbury Square, along the Lisburn Road.\n\nLisburn Road attracted shops and the nearby Malone Road was left residential. Queen's University is nearby, and there are a high number of expensive shops and restaurants, most of which are located at the upper end of the road. The Belfast City Hospital and the Queen's University Medical Biological Centre are also located on the road.\n\nRacist attacks\nIn June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian Romani families were ejected from their homes in Lisburn Road. Up to 115 people, including women and children, were forced to seek refuge in a local church hall after being attacked. They were later moved by the authorities to a safer location.\nAs a result of petty thefts gypsies were told to leave, they spent one night at QUB Elms Village at a cost of 40 pounds per room. \nFollowing the arrest of three local youths in relation to the attacks, the church where the Romani people had been given shelter was badly vandalised. Niall Colton and Kevin Briggs, who both attended QUB at the time of the attack, received police cautions after admitting vandalism of the Church. Police however stated that the vandalism was not racially motivated.\n\nLandmarks\n\nNotable landmarks along Lisburn Road include:\n Drumglass Park\nBelfast City Hospital\n The Samaritan Hospital, Belfast\nMethodist College Belfast (which also fronts the Malone Road)\nBelfast Chinese Christian Church\nWindsor Park football ground\nKing's Hall, Belfast (Former Exhibition and Concert Venue)\nBelfast Hypnotherapy Centre\n\nChurches\nWindsor Presbyterian Church\nSaint Nicholas' Church of Ireland, built in 1901\nSt Thomas' Church of Ireland\nLisburn Road Methodist Church, designed in 1906\nUlsterville Congregation Presbyterian\nSt. Brigids Church, Diocese of Down and Connor, Derryvolgie Avenue\n\nWildlife\nA sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) catching a sparrow (Passer domesticus) has been recorded from the Lisburn Road.\n\nRailway stations\nAdelaide\nBalmoral\nCity Hospital\n\nDeaf and Dumb Institute\nThe Deaf and Dumb Institute was built in 1845 and demolished in 1965, the site is now occupied by Queen's Medical Biology Centre.

It is a shopping and leisure destination as well as a commercial thoroughfare linking the city centre with the outer suburbs. It runs for approximately two miles from the city centre to the lower-lying suburbs of south Belfast, with much of it taking a ribbon formation along the banks of the River Lagan. The ‘Golden Mile’ is the nickname given to the main section of the Lisburn Road, stretching from Bridge End to the Chlorine Gardens.Along this stretch there can be found a myriad of pubs, restaurants, cafes, hotels and independent shops, as well as larger chain stores. This vibrant part of the city centre offers an eclectic mix of places to eat, shop and socialise, as it is seen as one of the main entertainment and leisure districts of Belfast. Moreover, the Lisburn Road offers an impressive selection of boutiques, art galleries, books and music stores, hairdressers, florists and a variety of specialist shops, making it a great spot for a day out filled with shopping and sightseeing. Although the area has been hit by economic decline and some shops have closed, there are now many more independent and boutique-style businesses adding to the street’s unique charm. The Lisburn Road is an important cultural area and is home to many major leisure venues, such as the Odyssey Arena, the luxurious Fitzwilliam Hotel and Ulster Museum. The area is also increasingly popular with young people, with a wealth of clubs, bars and live music venues providing a vibrant nightlife scene. Lisburn Road is also well-known for its architecture and historical buildings, with a wide range of examples of Victorian, Georgian and Edwardian homes lining its streets.

It is circumscribed by the perifovea.\n\nEffect on reading\nIn reading, information within 1° (approximately 6–8 characters) of the point of fixation is processed in foveal vision, while information up to 6° of visual angle benefits from parafoveal preview. Studies have shown that people can tell the difference in the letters of a word in the fovea and near-parafovea (the part of the parafovea closest to the fovea), but not in the outer edges of the parafovea. In languages that read from left to right, the word immediately to the right of the fixated word is known as the parafoveal word. Information present in the parafovea can interact with information present in the fovea. The benefit the parafoveal preview has is also mediated by how common the word in the parafovea is, with less common words providing less of a reduction in fixation duration when they reach foveal fixation. As the clarity of information in the parafovea is not as great as in the fovea, the SWIFT model of eye movements in reading, while allowing for parallel processing, accounts for this difference by assigning the parafoveal less processing power the further away it is from the foveal fixation.\n\nEffect on scene perception\nInformation in the parafovea can influence the processing of a scene. In categorization tasks of natural scenes information from the parafovea can be used to determine the gist of a scene well enough for a categorization judgement, though with reduced sensitivity and speed in comparison to foveal vision. An effect of parafoveal preview has also been found for emotional scenes presented in the parafovea, with people more likely shift their fixation point on emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, when both options are presented parafoveally.\n\nAdditional images\n\nSee also\n Eye movement in reading\n Eye movement in music reading\n Fixation (visual)\n Optical coherence tomography (OCT)\n\nReferences\n\nHuman eye anatomy\nVisual perception", "machine_text": " Parafovea is a visual illusion that can be experienced when looking at certain patterns. It is a phenomenon in which an afterimage or glare forms around an object at the center of vision. The effect also causes a perception of offset or diverging of the object's boundary. Parafovea was first identified by George W. Haberman in 1921. In his book, 'An Inquiry into the Physiology and Psychophysiology of Vision', he described the illusion as a \"vague halo around white or luminous objects.\" It is believed to be caused by the non uniform stimulation of the neural receptors in the retinal tissue. Theories suggest that when there is a high contrast in the concentric circles of the retina, such as a brightly lit circle surrounded by a dark background, the difference between the center and the surround results in a shift in the boundary of the image. It is most commonly seen when viewing an image featuring circles or rings with differences in intensity and shade. In these cases, the parafoveal effect is generally seen in the form of a slight warping of the perceived border of the circle. It is also seen more frequently when viewing an image in the presence of a bright light source. The parafoveal effect is found in various applications. It is used in optical technologies such as retinal imaging, non-destructive testing, and surveillance. The effect can also be seen in both natural phenomena and in a variety of man-made products, from watches, jewelry and telescopes to automotive lenses and photographic lenses. Although parafovea is a phenomenon that has been observed for many years, its cause and potential applications are subject to further research. Recent advances in research have resulted in the development of new optical technologies, ranging from the analysis of images captured from an artificial retinal imaging system, to the advent of a new non-invasive imaging technique.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Steve Hansen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sir Stephen William Hansen  and High Chief Of Vaiala, (born 7 May 1959) is a New Zealand rugby union coach and former player.\n\nHe was the head coach of the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, from 2012 to 2019, and won the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He stepped down at the end of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n\nHansen is also part owner of 2021 Everest winning horse Nature Strip.\n\nEarly life \nHansen was born in Mosgiel, to Desmond and Lauriss Hansen, who were dairy farmers on the Taieri Plain. He was educated at Outram Primary School, The Taieri High School, and Christchurch Boys' High School. A rugby union centre, he represented Canterbury at first-class level on 21 occasions.\n\nCoaching career \nHansen began his coaching career with the Canterbury provincial rugby union team from 1996 to 2001. During his tenure the side won the National Provincial Championship in 1997 and 2001. In 1999, 2000 and 2001, he was assistant coach to Wayne Smith and then Robbie Deans for the Canterbury Crusaders.\n\nWales \nHansen was the head coach of the Wales national team, becoming the ninth Wales coach in 13 years, after Graham Henry parted company with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in 2002. During his first game in charge, Wales performed well but lost by 37–33 to France. This became a familiar theme during his tenure as coach. Events reached a head during 2003 when for the first time in their history Wales lost every match in the Six Nations Championship and recorded a streak of 11 consecutive Test match defeats, broken by a defeat of rugby minnows Romania on 27 August 2003, though Hansen was not the coach for this match. Hansen resumed his role when he coached Wales during the 2003 Rugby World Cup, in which a strong display against the All Blacks and a spirited quarter final loss against England stopped the criticism of his coaching. He stepped down as Wales head coach in the summer of 2004 after not seeking to renew his contract and was succeeded by Mike Ruddock.\n\nReturn to New Zealand \nIn 2004, Hansen was appointed to the All Blacks as an assistant coach under Graham Henry. Hansen was considered as a likely candidate to become the next Crusaders coach, starting in the 2009 Super 14 season, after Robbie Deans left to coach Australia, but the Crusaders coaching job went to former All Black Todd Blackadder.\n\n2011 \nHansen assisted Graham Henry in coaching New Zealand to a win in the World Cup final  against France, ending a 24-year World Cup drought for the All Blacks. Hansen took over as head coach of the All Blacks when Graham Henry's contract expired at the end of 2011. He was formally appointed on 15 December 2011.\n\n2012 \nIn his first games as head coach, Hansen guided the All Blacks to a 3–0 series victory over Ireland during their 2012 tour, with the final game being a record 60–0 defeat for the Irish. On 25 August, the All Blacks retained the Bledisloe Cup for a tenth consecutive year after their second match against Australia during the 2012 Rugby Championship. His only defeat in 2012 came against England, a 38–21 loss on 1 December 2012.\n\nHe was named IRB Coach of the Year for 2012. In the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours, Hansen was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.\n\n2013 \nThe All Blacks retained the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup, and won 14 of 14 matches, becoming the first team to ever do this in the professional era. The team finished the year by winning 24–22 against Ireland. Hansen was named IRB coach of the year for the second year running.\n\n2014 \nIn 2014, having already defeated England 3–0 on their tour, New Zealand lost their first ever Rugby Championship match. On 4 October, they lost to South Africa 27–25 in Johannesburg, while they had also drawn their opening match of the Championship with Australia 12–all. Despite this, they retained their title for a third consecutive year. On 1 November 2014, Hansen led the All Blacks to a 74–6 win over the United States in Chicago. Hansen later led the team to a further three victories on their European tour, and was named World Rugby coach of the year.\n\n2015 \nHansen took the All Blacks to Samoa for the first ever official test match between the two teams in Samoa, where the All Blacks won the match 25–16. In a shortened Rugby Championship, the All Blacks failed to retain the title they held for three years. Having beaten Argentina 39–18 and South Africa 27–20, a final match against Australia would see either New Zealand or Australia claim the Championship. For the first time since 2011, Australia beat the All Blacks 27–19. During the 2015 Rugby World Cup, despite some error-ridden games in the Pool stage, Hansen led the All Blacks to the top of Pool C with victories over Argentina, 26–16, Namibia 58–14, Georgia 43–10 and Tonga 47–9, before beating France in the quarter-final 62–13 and South Africa 20–18 in the semi-final. They faced Australia in the final, winning 34–17 to become the first team ever to retain the Webb Ellis Cup. This was also the All Blacks' first ever Rugby World Cup victory outside New Zealand.\n\n2016 \nThe start of the 2016 season saw Hansen call up 7 uncapped players to the squad ahead of their 3-test series with Wales. Hansen was having to deal with the retirements of previous key players in Dan Carter, Richie McCaw, Keven Mealamu, Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith, with a guaranteed new mid-field trio needed to be tested. Despite the losses of the retired 5, their replacements, Sam Cane, Aaron Cruden, Ryan Crotty and Malakai Fekitoa, for the first test had already earned 96 caps between them and had been in the All Blacks environment since 2012. In the first test, Wales led the All Blacks 18–15 at the break, however the All Blacks scored 15 points in 5 minutes to lead Wales 32–21, with a final try on the 80th minute to win 39–21. The second test saw the team all tied up after 40 minutes 10–all, but 4 tries in 15 minutes saw New Zealand lead by 26 points heading into the final 10 minutes. 2 late tries by Wales in the closing period of the game saw the game end 36–22 to the All Blacks. Hansen led New Zealand a clean sweep, after New Zealand won the final test 46–6, with a new mid-field trio tested in Beauden Barrett, Ryan Crotty and George Moala. Many new players gained their first cap during the Welsh series including Eliot Dixon and Liam Squire.\n\nOn 25 July, Hansen was reappointed as the All Blacks head coach, seeing the role through to the end of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n\nDuring the 2016 Rugby Championship, the All Blacks secured their fourth title in 5 years, becoming the first side in either Rugby Championship or Tri-Nations to secure their title four rounds in. They won all 6 games convincingly, defeating Australia 42–8 and 29–9, Argentina 57–22 and 36–17 and South Africa 41–13 and 57–15. The following Bledisloe Cup game against Australia at Eden Park, saw the All Blacks secure a 37–10 victory, and with it a new Tier One World Record of 18 consecutive victories. This run was ended by a historic first victory by Ireland 40–29, in Chicago. However, Hansen later led the All Blacks to 3 consecutive wins, defeating Italy 68–10 with a team that had over 12 changes. The All Blacks played Ireland again in their third week of the tour, this time, earning a 21–9 victory in Dublin, before going on to win 24–19 against France in Paris.\n\n2017 \nIn 2017, Hansen led the All Blacks into their first test series against the British & Irish Lions since 2005, when Hansen was assistant to Graham Henry. Ahead of the series, he led his side to a convincing 78–0 victory over Samoa in a warm-up in Auckland. The test series against the Lions was highly anticipated in New Zealand, was and expectation of a 3–0 series win for the All Blacks. This expectation looked promising in the first test, where New Zealand ran out 30–15 victors. However, the series was drawn in the second test, with a first home loss for New Zealand since 2009, Hansen's first taste of a loss at home. Center Sonny Bill Williams was shown a red card 24 minutes into the game, giving the Lions the advantage for the rest of the game, and the Lions won 24–21. The All Blacks failed to score any tries in the game, something they had not done at home since 2002. The final test saw a controversial call from referee Romain Poite just minutes from full-time, a call that could have seen the All Blacks attempt a penalty kick which could have won the game. However, a scrum was called for an accidental offside, and the game ended 15–15, the first drawn test between the two sides.\nThe series ended in a draw for the first ever time against New Zealand.\n\nThe start of the 2017 Rugby Championship saw Hansen lead the All Blacks to a comprehensive win over Australia, 54–34 in Sydney. At one point, the All Blacks led 54–6, but conceded four tries in the last thirty minutes of the game. In the second round, New Zealand came from behind (17–0) to see out another victory over Australia 35–29. It was not until the 78th minute that the game was secure, with Australia leading 29–28 heading into the final minutes of the game. In round three, Hansen made significant changes to his team against Argentina, but New Zealand saw out the victory 39–22, even though they were behind at half time. In the fourth round, Hansen brought back his main players for their home game against South Africa. They helped New Zealand to an historic victory, beating South Africa 57–0 in what was their largest ever defeat. Leading into their fifth match, New Zealand had already secured their fifth Championship title, and wins over Argentina and South Africa away meant the All Blacks ended the Championship with six out of six wins.\n\nNew Zealand lost 23–18 loss to Australia in the third Bledisloe Cup test. This was the first loss against Australia since 2015, and the first time since 2011 that the All Blacks had lost multiple test matches. On 4 November, Hansen led an experimental, youthful and inexperienced side to a 31–22 uncapped win over the Barbarians at Twickenham. This was followed up by wins over France, 38–18, and 28–23 over a French XV. On 18 November, New Zealand were pushed by Scotland in Edinburgh, going into half time 3–all, but won 22–17. New Zealand finished their tour with a convincing 33–18 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\n2018\nThe start of 2018 saw France tour New Zealand for the first time since 2013. Despite a number of uncapped players in the squad, and without captain Kieran Read, Hansen led his side to a 3–0 series win and retained the Dave Gallaher Trophy for the fifth consecutive time. The series started with a convincing 52–11 win in Auckland, followed by a 26–13 win in Wellington, even with France down a man for 70 minutes after a controversial red card to fullback Benjamin Fall. The series ended in Dunedin, where the All Blacks with a much changed side from the first tests, ran out 49–14 victors.\n\nDuring the 2018 Rugby Championship, Hansen led his side to a 6th Championship title, winning five games. The only loss was to South Africa in the fourth round, 34–36, which saw South Africa record their first win against New Zealand in New Zealand since their 32–29 win in 2009. New Zealand then had the third Bledisloe test against Australia where they won 37–20. They started off their end of year tour with a 69–31 win over Japan, then sneaked past England in a 16–15 win. A week later they lost 9–16 to Ireland in Dublin, Ireland's first win at home over the All Blacks in their history. New Zealand's last match of the year was against Italy, which they won convincingly 66–3.\n\n2019\nThe start of 2019 for Hansen saw his side finish third in the Rugby Championship; the first time they have finished in that position since Argentina joined the Rugby Championship  – the last being during the 2004 Tri Nations Series. The Championship saw a first draw against the Springboks since 1994, followed by a record-equalling defeat at the hands of the Wallabies, 47–26. Despite that score, New Zealand went onto secure the Bledisloe Cup after beating Australia in the return leg 36–0.\n\nIn the 2019 Rugby World Cup New Zealand topped their pool, defeating eventual champions South Africa, but were comfortably defeated in the semi-final 19-7 by England. New Zealand went on to beat Wales 40-17 in the bronze match.\n\nCoaching statistics\n\nWales\n\nInternational matches as head coach \nNote: World Rankings Column shows the World Ranking Wales was placed at on the following Monday after each of their matches\n\nRecord by country\n\nNew Zealand\n\nInternational matches as head coach \nNote: World Rankings Column shows the World Ranking New Zealand was placed at on the following Monday after each of their matches\n\nRecord by country\n\nHonours \n\n Rugby World Cup\n Winners: 2015\n Third Place: 2019\n The Rugby Championship\n Winners: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018\n Runners-up: 2015\n Bledisloe Cup\n Winners: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n Dave Gallaher Trophy\n Winners: 2013 (2x), 2016, 2017, 2018\n Freedom Cup\n Winners: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n Killik Cup\n Winners: 2017\n\n Hillary Shield\n Winners: 2013, 2014 (2x), 2018\n British & Irish Lions series\n Winners: 2017 (Drawn series – Shared title)\n World Rugby Coach of the Year\n Winner: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016\n World Rugby Team of the Year (New Zealand)\n Winners: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017\n Laureus World Team of the Year (New Zealand)\n Winners: 2016\n\nOther honours \n\nNew Zealand (as assistant coach)\n World Rugby Team of the Year (New Zealand)\n Winners: 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011\n Rugby World Cup\n Winners: 2011 Winners 2015 Rugby world cup\n Tri Nations\n Winners: 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010\n Runners-up: 2009, 2011\n Bledisloe Cup\n Winners: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011\n Freedom Cup\n Winners: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011\n Dave Gallaher Trophy\n Winners: 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009\n Hillary Shield\n Winners: 2008, 2009, 2010\n British & Irish Lions series\n Winners: 2005\n Grand Slam tour\n Winners: 2005, 2008, 2010\n\nCanterbury\n ITM Cup\n Winners: 1997, 2001\n\nCrusaders (as assistant coach)\n Super 12\n Winners: 1999, 2000\n\nBarbarians\n Killik Cup\n Winners: 2013 (vs Fiji)\n\nSee also \n High School Old Boys RFC\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Hansen stands in for Wales\n I'm so proud of you, says old boss Hansen\n \n\n|-\n\n1959 births\nLiving people\nKnights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit\nNew Zealand national rugby union team coaches\nNew Zealand rugby union coaches\nNew Zealand rugby union players\nPeople educated at Taieri College\nPeople from Mosgiel\nWales national rugby union team coaches\nPeople educated at Christchurch Boys' High School\nRugby players and officials awarded knighthoods", "machine_text": " Steve Hansen (born 1958 in Mosgiel, New Zealand) is a former rugby union coach, currently the head coach of the All Blacks, the New Zealand national team. He began his professional coaching career in 1998 with Canterbury, and became the first New Zealand-born head coach of the All Blacks in 2012. Under his tenure, the All Blacks have won two Rugby World Cups, the Rugby Championship five times, a Grand Slam over England in 2018, and held a 77-game winning streak from August 2015 to October 2019. Hansen played as a fullback for Canterbury and Otago between 1980 and 1991, but despite having won the semi-professional division of rugby, he never represented New Zealand at the international level. Afterwards, he began coaching, first as a skills coach at Manawatu, then as the head coach of Canterbury. He took the Canterbury team to five provincial titles in seven years, the Air New Zealand Cup in 2006 and 2007, and the national championship in 2008 and 2009. In 2004 Hansen was appointed assistant coach of the All Blacks and in 2007 he became the team's attack and skills coach. When Graham Henry stepped down as the head coach of the All Blacks, Hansen was promoted to the role. His appointment as head coach won the support of his former players, team-mates and mentors. In the seven years under Hansen the All Blacks played a total of 99 international matches, winning 91 of them, drawing two and losing only six. They were undefeated in 24 Test matches and won five Rugby Championships, extending the record for most consecutive title wins from three to five. The team also reached their highest ever world number one ranking in November 2016 and held the pinnacle ranking for 83 months. The All Blacks’ greatest achievement was winning back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019 - the first team to do so since South Africa in 1995 and 2007. Hansen’s coaching style has been credited for many of the successes of the All Blacks. He stresses on attacking tactics, with artistic flair, skill and fitness. His players are encouraged to think for themselves and he makes sure they enjoy their rugby. Hansen has been recognised around the world for his achievements as a coach, winning numerous awards including the World Rugby International Coach of the Year in 2016, and the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2018. He is widely regarded as the best rugby union coach of all-time.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6516567}

It extended for most of the campaign period for that election, but grew especially intensive toward the actual date of the election on November 7. It marked the first appearance of John Oliver on the show.\n\nIn particular, the Indecision 2006 coverage extended to the Midwest Midterm Midtacular, which was a special of The Daily Show that aired from October 30, 2006 through November 2, 2006. It was filmed in Columbus, Ohio at Roy Bowen Theater on the campus of Ohio State University.\n\nThe Midtacular chose to film in Ohio due to that state's highly contested and critical role in the outcomes of both the midterm elections held on November 7, 2006 and in the 2004 Presidential election (another possible reason is that Ohio is located in the Midwest/middle of the United States, in keeping with the \"middle\" centric theme). Featured candidates from Ohio were the successful Ohio Governor's election candidate Ted Strickland and opponent Ken Blackwell and successful Democratic Ohio Senate election candidate Sherrod Brown who went on to defeat incumbent Republican Mike DeWine.\n\nIt was the fifth time that The Daily Show traveled outside New York City for its Indecision campaign. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Boston (for the 2004 Democratic National Convention) have also been featured.\n\nFirst episode\nThe first episode of the special was covered from various Applebee's restaurants in Youngstown, Cincinnati, and Shaker Heights as well as a Bob Evans restaurant in Chillicothe. In addition, Samantha Bee covered a segment from Columbus—filming at the Ohio Statehouse and the Columbus Hooter's. The first guest on the special was Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James.\n\nThe crowd showed strong vocal support for successful Democratic candidates Brown and Strickland. They booed at footage where Blackwell suggested Strickland had been a member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association and cheered when LeBron James claimed he would have attended Ohio State University had he not been able to enter the NBA at 18.\n\nSecond episode\nThe second episode featured specials on voting changes made by Ken Blackwell that restricted voting by minorities in 2004. It was said that, \"this was the first time a black man was able to disenfranchise someone in this country.\" It also featured the tight races in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Tennessee. Also, the political commercials that have been featured across the nation were parodied. Stewart's guest was The Ohio State University political science professor John Mueller who wrote the book Overblown.\n\nMidterm Midtacular Election Day Special\nThe Midtacular culminated in a live, hour-long episode on the night of Election Day, November 7, 2006. The episode was a joint venture with The Colbert Report and its host, former Daily Show correspondent Stephen Colbert. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather also joined as a special correspondent. Guests included Robert Wexler and Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2000\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2004\nComedy Central's Indecision 2008\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2010\n\nThe Daily Show\nThe Colbert Report\n2006 elections in the United States\n2006 in American television", "machine_text": " The Daily Show: Indecision 2006 is a compilation of episodes from the Emmy-winning Comedy Central show, The Daily Show.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Naval Intelligence Department (United Kingdom)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Naval Intelligence Department (NID) was the intelligence arm of the British Admiralty from 1887 until 1912 when most of its subsidiary divisions were absorbed during the creation of the Admiralty War Staff department that included a new Naval Intelligence Division that concentrated in that sphere solely. It dealt with intelligence matters concerning British naval plans, and with the collection of naval intelligence in regard to coastal defences, foreign powers, mobilisation, trade and war.\n\nHistory\nThe Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.\n\nThe NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.\n\nIn 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.\n\nIn 1912 the department was restructured with most of its divisions and functions being absorbed within the Admiralty War Staff organisation the department was abolished and re-emerged as the Naval Intelligence Division of the new department.\n\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence included:\n Captain William Henry Hall, 1887–1889\n Rear-Admiral Cyprian Bridge, 1889–1894\n Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895–1899\n Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899–1902\n Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902–1905\n Captain Charles Ottley, 1905–1907\n Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, 1907–1909\n Rear-Admiral Alexander Bethell, 1909–1912\n\nAssistant directors\nIncluded:\nAssistant Director Mobilisation Division\n Captain Reginald N.

The NID was the first organized intelligence body of the Royal Navy and oversaw a wide range of intelligence activities. These activities included air reconnaissance, cryptography, code breaking, espionage, and information collection. The NID was responsible for the supplying the Admiralty with intelligence on the capabilities and movements of foreign fleets, political and economic information, and for the security of naval communications and naval establishments. The NID was founded in 1882 by then-First Sea Lord Lord Fisher. The NID took over various diverse intelligence functions that had previously been handled by various offices within the Admiralty. It was housed in the Admiralty until 1909 when the duties and personnel of the NID were transferred to the new Room 40, under the control of the Deputy Chief of Naval Intelligence. The NID overcame the lack of unified intelligence gathering apparatus in the Royal Navy and began to collaborate more closely with the army and foreign intelligence services. By World War I, the NID was firmly in place and expanded its staff and resources to help the Royal Navy combat the German High Seas Fleet. Intelligence gathering during and after World War I was provided by the Naval Defense Research Section. The NID played a major role during the development of the new technology of cryptanalysis in the 1920s. Room 40 personnel, in particular Captain William Reginald Hall, oversaw the decryption of German Naval codes, and the NID took part in the British theft of the Enigma machine and encouraged the use of the \"Ultra\" intelligence derived from intercepted German communications. With the rise of the Cold War, the NID and other intelligence operations were reshaped and reorganized to reflect the new strategic environment. In 1964, the NID merged into the Admiralty's Principal Warfare Office. In its 82 years of existence, the NID, under various names, served first as the Royal Navy's primary source of intelligence and ultimately as playing a critical role in safeguarding Britain's security.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53270045}

It also makes it the second series co-produced with and owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the Canadian-Hungarian spy thriller crime drama action series X Company.\n\nReception\nTom Conroy of Media Life Magazine found the European flavour of the show, seen in such things as travelling by train to various cities, to be a refreshing change from the norm of American shows. He felt that Donald Sutherland was cast purely for the name-recognition factor and that he was given some lines in which he philosophically talks to pigeons as a means of justifying the cost of casting him. Overall, Conroy found it an \"unimaginative procedural\" that, despite its title, \"generally colors within the lines\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle also found the location to be what sets Crossing Lines apart. He felt the presence of Donald Sutherland was a benefit to the show. Joanne Ostrow of Heritage Newspapers felt the show to be a \"contrivance for foreign sales more than a serious drama\".\n\nCrossing Lines has been criticised as misrepresenting the International Criminal Court's nature and purpose, which, in reality, only has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. The International Criminal Court lacks an organization comparable to the special crime unit, and has no police force of its own. Kevin Jon Heller, Associate Professor & Reader in international criminal law at the University of Melbourne, noted the show creates unacceptable misconceptions about the court's power and the way it operates, which depends on states consenting to its jurisdiction through ratification of the Rome Statute and co-operating with the court to provide resources required to perform investigations and prosecutions.\n\nWithout all the shooting, Crossing Lines is more closely related to the special crimes investigations unit of the first International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands. These crime investigators from all over the world do indeed operate across national jurisdictional lines in connection with major crimes such as murder, rape, torture and kidnapping that occurred in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. John Cencich's The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story (Potomac Books, Washington, D.C.) demonstrates how police investigators from Germany, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and many others worked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations Security Council, without relying on national police forces, to investigate and bring to justice some of the world's worst criminals.\n\nSee also \n FBI: International—an American crime television series featuring a Europe-based detective squad\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official Facebook page\n Crossing Lines at NBC\n Crossing Lines at Tandem Communications\n \n\n2013 American television series debuts\n2015 American television series endings\n2010s American crime drama television series\nFrench crime television series\n2013 German television series debuts\n2015 German television series endings\nTelevision shows set in the Netherlands\nEnglish-language television shows\nCBC Television original programming\nNBC original programming\nTelevision series by Tandem Productions\nTelevision series by Sony Pictures Television\nTelevision series created by Edward Allen Bernero\nSat.1 original programming\nWorks about the Russian Mafia", "machine_text": " Crossing Lines is a crime fiction television series that is produced by French-German channel organisation Telfrance and focuses on the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Electricity provider switching\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Electricity provider switching is the ability of power consumers to have an option to choose their electricity provider in a deregulated electricity market as permitted by a state public utilities governing body.\n\nAustralia\nThe Australian market has been somewhat deregulated, but still sees consumers provided with a narrow band of choices.\n\nCanada\nElectricity is deregulated in two Canadian provinces: Ontario and Alberta. Both markets showed price spikes in the first year of deregulation, but then settled down into a volatile but reasonably stable environment. Alberta's market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such reacts more closely to the price of natural gas. Ontario's generation mix is about 50% nuclear.\n\nOntario\nThe consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from one of the deregulated suppliers.   There is a large range of contract options from a variable price to 1,3 or 5 year fixed prices.   Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.   However, as of January 2010 there is a maximum termination penalty allowed.\n\nA very important element in switching electricity providers in Ontario is understanding the Global Adjustment.  This is an adjustment for some commitments government agencies have made on your behalf. It is included in the LDC Regulated Price Plan, but is an additional line item if a contract is signed.\n\nAlberta\nThe consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from a deregulated suppliers. There are however many fewer of these in Alberta. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.\n\nThere is a price comparison service operation in Canada.\n\nFrance \nIn France, electricity market is totally deregulated and consumers have the choice between the historical formerly state-owned provider EDF and several new private providers like Direct Énergie.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nElectricity supply has also been deregulated in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnited States\nIn deregulated markets such as Texas and Maryland, the state government may require the incumbent utility energy provider to allow for unlimited competition within the marketplace, where the consumer is free to choose any electricity provider. Electricity provider switching is only practical if a customer is either buying from a utility or is at the end of a fixed-price contract with a provider.\n\nCertain U.S. states allow for consumer choice in electricity providers, with Texas being the most-widely watched deregulatory scheme.  Many other states are surveying the Texas deregulatory model in order to use its design as a model for the imposition of free market forces within such other power markets.\n\nAs of 2019, 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have \"either full or partial retail choice.\" Along with aforementioned Maryland and Texas, electricity deregulation is current in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Seven additional U.S. states began the process of electricity deregulation but have suspended efforts: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nIn 2019, Arizona's regulatory agency (Arizona Corporation Commission) considered implementing retail electricity deregulation. The proposal was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), an electric utility that provides electricity to 2.7 million people. APS said it was opposed because the change would \"not be in the best interest of customers\" because it would create issues surrounding reliability, \"conflicts . . . with existing law,\" and clean energy implementation difficulties.\n\nA broad and diverse group of retail energy suppliers who share the common vision that competitive retail energy markets deliver a more efficient, customer-oriented outcome than a regulated utility structure. \n\nRetailers Include:\nAEP Energy\n, APG&E Energy Solutions\n, Calpine Energy Solutions\n, Constellations NewEnergy, INC\n, Crius Energy\n, Direct Energy Services LLC\n, Dynegy\n, ENGIE Resources\n, Entrust Energy\n, IGS Energy\n, Just Energy\n, Liberty Power \n, Next Era Energy Services\n, Nordic Energy Services, LLC\n, NRG Energy INC\n, Source Energy \n, Spark Energy\n, Starion Energy\n, Stream Energy\n, Talen Energy\n, TransCanada Power Marketing LTD.\n\nSee also \nCommunity Choice Aggregation\nDeregulation\nDeregulation of the Texas electricity market\nElectricity market\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nA Misguided Criticism of Texas Electricity Deregulation, by Lynne Kiesling\n\nElectric power distribution", "machine_text": " Electricity provider switching is the process of changing electricity supplier in order to take advantage of better rates, different products, or improved service. This allows customers to select between different electricity plans and providers based on their preferences. As electricity providers compete for customers, there are often significant savings opportunities available for those willing to switch, depending on the cost of energy in their particular geographic region. With the rise of electricity deregulation, customers can now select from a variety of electricity providers. Deregulation allows electricity providers to offer different rates and plans, depending on the type of energy they produce and the region in which it is provided. These rates and plans can differ significantly based on local regulations and taxes. Electricity deregulation has therefore paved the way for switching electricity providers and gaining access to competitively priced electricity plans. There are a number of advantages of switching electricity providers. Customer service is typically improved when switching, as providers compete to attract new customers. Moreover, competitive electricity pricing often accompanies switching to a new provider. In addition to better rates, customers may be able to secure additional perks such as loyalty rewards and special promotions. Furthermore, switching can make customers eligible for green electricity plans, allowing them to support renewable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint. Instructions on how to switch electricity providers will vary depending on providers, but they generally involve filling out an application form to provide key information such as name, address, type of electricity plan desired, and payment method. In addition, it is important to contact the current electricity provider to cancel the existing service and settle any past-due bills. Switching electricity providers allows customers to take advantage of better products, services, and prices. It is important to compare different providers carefully in order to identify the best plan for individual needs – benefits range from lower prices and improved customer service to additional perks such as renewable energy plans. Ultimately, the process of switching electricity providers can be beneficial to both customers and providers alike, providing an affordable and efficient way of obtaining electricity.

He was accepted into Harvard and Wharton, but couldn't afford tuition. Instead, he went to work in a timber and coal company with local offices. At age 21 he proved himself to be an effective farm manager, making investment decisions that dramatically increased the output of a local farm under the firms control.,\n\nCareer\nSchram's early success in farm management led him accept a position as chairman of the National Drainage Association, an agricultural trade group. While working for the Association, Schram applied for loans with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which was a Depression/New Deal era government corporation tasked with making loans to infrastructure projects and businesses and helping banks resume normal operations.\n\nIn 1933, Schram joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1939 he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RFC. His chairmanship was short lived, however, because less than two years later he was offered the position that would define his career.\n\nIn 1941 the New York Stock Exchange was still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. Trade volume was very low, seats were sold cheaper than in previous decades, and the exchange had been the target of political attacks. A selection committee was formed to find a new president, and they selected Schram.  Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years.\n\nSchram reformed the management structure of the Exchange, removing many of the traditional committees in favor of a top-town approach. He spent $500,000 per year on nationwide advertising programs encouraging the public to hold on to war bonds in an effort to keep small-time investors out of the market. Under Schram's leadership, the NYSE recovered, and public confidence was restored.\n\nLater career\nIn 1951, at age 58, Schram retired from the Exchange and returned home to Peru, Indiana.

Recipients can immediately read the message while it is being written, without waiting.\n\nReal-time text is used for conversational text, in collaboration, and in live captioning. Technologies include TDD/TTY devices for the deaf, live captioning for TV, Text over IP (ToIP), some types of instant messaging, captioning for telephony/video teleconferencing, telecommunications relay services including ip-relay, transcription services including Remote CART, TypeWell, collaborative text editing, streaming text applications, next-generation 9-1-1/1-1-2 emergency service. Obsolete TDD/TTY devices are being replaced by more modern real-time text technologies, including Text over IP, ip-relay, and instant messaging.\n\nDuring 2012, the Real-Time Text Taskforce (R3TF) designed a standard international symbol to represent real-time text, as well as the alternate name Fast Text to improve public education of the technology.\n\nUse over instant messaging \n\nWhile standard instant messaging is not real-time text (the message is only sent at the end of a thought, not while it is being composed), a real-time text option is found in some instant messaging software, including AOL Instant Messenger's \"Real-Time IM\" feature. Real-time text is also possible over any XMPP compatible chat networks, including those used by Apple iChat, Cisco WebEx, and Google Talk, by using appropriate software that has a real-time text feature. When present in IM programs, the real-time text feature can be turned on/off, just like other chat features such as audio. Real-time text programs date at least to the 1970s, with the talk program on the DEC PDP-11, which remains in use on Unix systems.\n\nCertain real-time text applications have a feature that allows the real-time text to be \"turned off\", for temporary purposes. This allows the sender to pre-compose the message as a standard IM or text message before transmitting.\n\nUse by the deaf \nReal-time text is frequently used by the deaf, including IP-Relay services, TDD/TTY devices, and Text over IP. Real-time text allows the other person to read immediately, without waiting for the sender to finish composing his or her sentence/message. This allows conversational use of text, much like a hearing person can listen to someone speaking in real-time.\n\nCaptioned telephony \nCaptioned telephony is the streaming of real-time text captions in parallel with speech on a phone call.  This is used by people who are hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best they can, hearing all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough.  In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.\n\nUse in collaboration \nCollaborative real-time editing is the utilization of real-time text for shared editing, rather than for conversation. Split screen chat, where conversational text appears continuously, is also considered real-time text. Some examples that provide this as a service are Apache Wave and its fork SwellRT, Etherpad, the editor Gobby, and most notably Google Docs.\n\nCaptioning, transcriptions and other uses \nReal-time text is used in closed captioning and when captions are being streamed live continuously during live events. Transcription services including Communication Access Real-Time Translation and TypeWell frequently use real-time text, where text is streamed live to a remote display. This is used in court reporting, and is also used by deaf attendees at a conference. Also, real-time text provides an enhancement to text messaging on mobile phones, via real-time texting apps.\n\nReal-time text protocols \nReal-time text protocols include Text over IP (ToIP) designed around ITU-T T.140, IETF RFC 4103, RFC 5194, and XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0301.\n\nTotal conversation \nAccording to ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.703, total conversation defines the simultaneous use of audio, video and real-time text. An instant messaging program that can enable all three features simultaneously would be compliant.

It is also known as “right now text” or “immediate text”, as messages appear almost immediately on the receiver’s screen. Real-time text can be used by individuals with a hearing impairment, as sign language interpreters are not necessary and the message can be sent and received instantly. Real-time text is used in various modes such as: * Telephone: It is used when two individuals use a telephone to communicate with each other. In this scenario, both individuals type their messages on the phone keypad and view the other person’s messages on their telephone screen. * Computer: Computer-based programming systems can also be used to communicate in real-time text. This can be beneficial for situations such as online job interviews where the prospective employer and the applicant are in two different locations. * Internet: The most common form of RTT is through the use of the internet. This allows people to type and send text messages to each other through an online chat platform such as Google Hangouts, AIM, or Skype. There are several advantages to using real-time text. By providing immediate feedback and communication, RTT helps to increase collaboration, aid in decision making and enable faster resolution of issues. Since RTT is a text-based, non-intrusive mode of communication, it can be used in environments such as doctor-patient consultations, business meetings, etc. Furthermore, the technology is relatively easy and relatively cost-effective to implement compared to other real-time communication tools. However, there are also some drawbacks of RTT. Since the use of RTT is limited to text-based communication, it does not replace other forms of communication such as audio and video calls which can be more effective for certain purposes. There also is a potential for misunderstandings and misinterpretations due to typing errors. Finally, RTT protocols are still in development, so there is not a standard way of using the technology, which can cause confusion among users. Overall, real-time text is a useful technology, especially when audio and/or video calls are unavailable, impractical or inappropriate. It is ideal for situations such as email conversations, group chats and long-distance communications. While RTT is not a perfect solution and does have some drawbacks, it does provide an efficient, text-based mode of communication for those who need it.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32335474}

It is covered by a hip roof, with two chimneys rising behind the main ridge line.  The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical placement of sash windows around the centered entrance.  Windows are capped by brownstone lintels, and the building corners are finished with brownstone quoining. The main entrance features a doorway with half-round fanlight, and a gabled portico supported by slender round columns.  The main roof's cornice has dentil moulding, and its front face is pierced by three dormers, with peaked or semicircular gables.\n\nThe house was built in the 1790s for Benjamin Williams, a well-to-do sea captain (Middletown was then a major shipping center in trade with the West Indies).  Williams died in 1812, and his heirs sold the house to Henry deKoven.  It remained in the hands of his descendants until 1942, during which time it was converted to professional use.

Built by Benjamin Williams between 1737 and 1761, the house is significant for its architecture, construction method, and occupancy. Benjamin Williams was a sea captain and trader in the early colonial period of North Carolina. He was born in 1708, and by 1737 he had established himself in Hampstead as a successful merchant and sea captain. He built the house himself, and named it after himself, likely in tribute to his nautical career, as the house is built in a style and shape typical of ships of that era. The house, which is located in Pender County, is two stories and includes two unique features, a watch turret and a widow's walk. The watch turret was used by Williams to keep an eye out for approaching vessels and trading opportunities, while the widow's walk, which is a roof-level observation platform, was influenced by his seagoing experiences. The house has been a private residence since the time of its construction, owned by Benjamin Williams and his direct descendants until 2006. In 2007, the house was purchased by Captain's House Preservation Inc., a nonprofit organization whose mission is to restore, preserve and maintain the house. The house has been through many renovations since it was first constructed. During the 1960s, it was extensively modified and modernized, though much of the original historical features were retained.

Seomun Market started out as a small market selling food and groceries in the early days, but it has since grown to become a large traditional market selling a wide range of products. The market expanded significantly in 2006, covering an area of 28,995 m2 and consisting of some 8,000 stores, making it the second largest market in South Korea. The market has four main divisions: the cloth market, food and groceries, restaurants, and featured brands. The cloth market has various clothing stores, tailors and fabric shops, with items ranging from casual to luxurious clothing, as well as traditional Korean clothing. The food and groceries market sells seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables, dried foods, groceries, other food items and kitchenware. It is the largest of the food markets in Daegu, and is considered to be a foodie paradise. The restaurant section has a variety of South Korean, Japanese and Chinese food stores, ranging from stylish restaurants to lone food carts. As for the featured brands, there are many local stores, including large department stores, special boutiques and shopping malls. Seomun Market hosts various cultural events year-round, such as the Seomunga Festival, the Seomun Night Market, and the Daegu Music Festival. Due to its vibrant atmosphere and competitive prices, the market has become a major tourist attraction in Daegu. In conclusion, Seomun Market is an important traditional market in Daegu and South Korea, that carries an array of products and experiences. It is where locals and tourists alike can enjoy shopping, eating, and various cultural events.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4301519}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Axel Höjer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Johan Axel Höjer (12 August – 22 April 1974) was a Swedish physician and public servant.\n\nCareer\nHöjer was born on 12 August 1890 in Visby, Sweden, the son of Professor Nils Höjer and Emmy Höjer. He began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1908 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1916. He went to Paris in 1919, where he became acquainted with the nurse Signe Dahl and they later married in 1920.  In addition to his work and social commitment, in the early 1920s Höjer researched vitamin C and its role in connective tissue cell maturation. He submitted his thesis in Stockholm in 1924 for PhD degree as Studies in scurvy, and then became the Associate Professor of Hygiene in the Physiological Institute at Lund University.\n\nIn 1930, he was appointed as the city physician () of Malmö and subsequently, in 1935, became Director General of the National Swedish Board of Health, a post he left in 1952. During his time on the Medical Board, he made several reforms in terms of preventive care, including family planning, maternal assistance and care of infants as well as dental services. Additionally during that time, the Vipeholm experiments on dental caries were conducted.\n\nHöjer was appointed to the UN's expert commission for economic affairs and its housing commission. He was sent as a special officer for improving medical education in India at the request of Travancore-Cochin state (present-day Kerala state). Höjer was appointed as the Principal of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, a position he held until 1954.\n\nAfter retirement, he worked on international issues, including the effects of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Höjer Investigation \nHöjer led the Board of Health study in 1948 on health care reorganization. The study suggested a focus on preventive care and strengthening of provincial medical offices. The proposal was motivated in particular by the fact that the proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. In the study, the Medical Board argued against the Medical Association's view with regard to primary care. The report advocated a polyclinic model, where outpatient health care would be free and community-run.\n\nThe Höjer study was the first more comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested the establishment of health centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and would be located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and be located in the provincial doctors' stations. Höjer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.\n\nControversies \nHöjer's combination of pacifism, socialism, anti-clericalism, anti-Nazism and temperance led to political persecution in Sydsvenska Dagbladet and Aftonbladet, Swedish newspapers. He was dismissed from a job as a teacher in the Southern Sweden Nursing School on the grounds that he held a lecture on sexual health. As city physician () in Malmö, he tried to address air pollution from the Scanian Cement factory at Limhamn in Malmö. The company director threatened Malmö municipality, stating the company would move to another location if they followed the doctor's recommendations.\n\nConcerning Jewish refugees, Höjer met stiff resistance from the management of the Swedish medical establishment. When a Jewish ophthalmologist had to leave his home after the German occupation of Danzig and tried to find work in Sweden, the medical professionals in the country sued to stop it, citing various reasons. A campaign with a hint of anti-Semitism was taken up by the medical establishments. When the Medical Board in 1939 planned to invite 12 Jewish specialty physicians to Sweden, the doctors' associations protested, suggesting it would lead to unemployment. , a protest arranged by the student body at Uppsala University, also spoke out against accepting Jewish refugees. The royal family intervened, and Höjer was called to the ruler, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, with the proposal that Sweden should accept only a small number of Jewish doctors who were fleeing Hitler's persecution. \"He asked me pleadingly to refrain from proposals and actions, which could put the unity of the Swedish people in danger. I answered respectfully but firmly – with the Court Marshal listening in the background – that I obviously did not want to increase the government's difficulties, but I found that the request is primarily aimed to appease the anti-Semitic circles. It would be ignominious if Sweden were to betray people in danger. The Crown Prince reiterated his warning. I declared I would keep it in mind the future, and would do it if my conscience allows. We parted without further discussion\". Höjer also asked to increase the number of doctors in the country, by importing Austrian physicians in 1950, which again was opposed by the Medical Association.\n\nBibliography \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  (autobiography)\n\nReferences\n\n1890 births\n1974 deaths\n20th-century Swedish physicians\nSwedish healthcare managers\nPeople from Gotland\nKarolinska Institute alumni", "machine_text": " Axel Höjer (1885-1959) was a Swedish mathematician and professor of mathematics at Uppsala University.

He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Uppsala in 1906, and then in 1913 went on to obtain his doctoral degree. He spent the following year as a research assistant under the supervision of Helmut Hasse in Germany. In 1918 Höjer became a professor of mathematics at Uppsala University, a position he held until his death. Höjer's primary research interest was algebraic number theory, which he made several important contributions to, including the proof of the important lemma of Kronecker-Weber in 1918. This lemma essentially states that every abelian number field, or a field generated by roots of a polynomial, is contained inside a cyclotomic field, which is a field generated by roots of unity. Höjer also made major contributions to the study of class field theory, which includes class groups, ideal classes, and cyclic algebras. Through his research, Höjer wrote many books and articles, including \"Eine Darstellung der Galoisköpechensubgruppe der Q\" and \"Ringskurs\", both of which became standard textbooks on the subject of algebraic number theory. In addition to his research, Axel Höjer was an active member of several professional organizations, and served in various positions during his academic career. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1938, and was later inducted into the Order of the Polar Star in 1954.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Turkish Cypriots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turkish Cypriots or Cypriot Turks ( or Kıbrıslı Türkler; ) are mostly ethnic Turks originating from Cyprus. Following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers were given land once they arrived in Cyprus. Additionally, many of the island's local Christians converted to Islam during the early years of Ottoman rule. Nonetheless, the influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period. Today, while Northern Cyprus is home to a significant part of the Turkish Cypriot population, the majority of Turkish Cypriots live abroad, forming the Turkish Cypriot diaspora. This diaspora came into existence after the Ottoman Empire transferred the control of the island to the British Empire, as many Turkish Cypriots emigrated primarily to Turkey and the United Kingdom for political and economic reasons. \n\nStandard Turkish is the official language of Northern Cyprus. The vernacular spoken by Turkish Cypriots is Cypriot Turkish, which has been influenced by Cypriot Greek as well as English.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Ottoman Cyprus\nAlthough there was no settled Muslim population in Cyprus prior to the Ottoman conquest of 1570–71, some Ottoman Turks were captured and \ncarried off as prisoners to Cyprus in the year 1400 during Cypriot raids in the Asiatic and Egyptian coasts. Some of these captives accepted or were forced to convert to Christianity and were baptized; however, there were also some Turkish slaves who remained unbaptized. By 1425, some of these slaves helped the Mamluke army to gain access to Limassol Castle. Despite the release of some of the captives, after the payment of ransoms, most of the baptized Turks continued to remain on the island. The medieval Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas recalled that the baptized Turks were not permitted to leave Nicosia when the Mamlukes approached the city after the battle of Khirokitia in 1426. According to Professor Charles Fraser Beckingham, \"there must therefore have been some Cypriots, at least nominally Christian, who were of Turkish, Arab, or Egyptian origin.\"\n\nBy 1488, the Ottomans made their first attempt at conquering Cyprus when Sultan Bayezid II sent a fleet to conquer Famagusta. However, the attempt failed due to the timely intervention of a Venetian fleet. The Queen of Cyprus, Caterina Cornaro, was forced to relinquish her crown to the Republic of Venice in 1489. In the same year, Ottoman ships were seen off the coast of Karpas and the Venetians began to strengthen the fortifications of the island. By 1500, coastal raids by Ottoman vessels resulted in the heavy loss of Venetian fleets, forcing Venice to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1503. However, by May 1539 Suleiman I decided to attack Limassol because the Venetians had been sheltering pirates who continuously attacked Ottoman ships. Limassol stayed under Ottoman control until a peace treaty was signed in 1540. Cyprus continued to be a haven for pirates who interrupted the safe passage of Ottoman trade ships and Muslim pilgrims sailing to Mecca and Medina. By 1569, pirates captured the Ottoman defterdar (treasurer) of Egypt, and Selim II decided to safeguard the sea route from Constantinople to Alexandria by conquering the island and clearing the eastern Mediterranean of all enemies in 1570–71.\n\nOttoman Cyprus\n\nThe basis for the emergence of a sizeable and enduring Turkish community in Cyprus emerged when Ottoman troops landed on the island in mid-May 1570 and seized it within a year from Venetian rule. The post-conquest period established a significant Muslim community which consisted of soldiers from the campaign who remained behind and further settlers who were brought from Anatolia as part of a traditional Ottoman population policy. There were also new converts to Islam on the island during the early years of Ottoman rule.\n\nIn addition to documented settlement of Anatolian peasants and craftsmen, as well as the arrival of soldiers, decrees were also issued banishing Anatolian tribes, \"undesirable\" persons, and members of various \"troublesome\" Muslim sects, principally those officially classified as heretical. This influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period.\n\nSome Turkish Cypriots are descendants of Crypto-Christians, a phenomenon that was not uncommon in the Ottoman Empire given its multi-faith character. In Cyprus, many Latins and Maronites, as well as Greeks, converted to Islam at different points during Ottoman rule for a number of reasons ranging from collectively avoiding heavy taxation to ending an individual woman unhappy marriage. Their artificial embrace of Islam and their secret maintaining of Christianity led this group of crypto-Christians to be known in Greek as 'Linobamvaki' or the cotton-linen sect as they changed religion to curry favour with Ottoman officials during the day but practiced Catholicism at night. In 1636 the conditions for the Christians became intolerable and certain Christians decided to become Muslims. According to Palmieri (1905) the Maronites who became Muslims lived mainly in the Nicosia District and despite the fact that the Maronites turned to Muslims they never gave up their Christian faith and beliefs hoping to become Christians. This is why they baptized their children according to the Christian faith, but they also practiced circumcision. They also gave their children two names, a Muslim and a Christian one. Many of the villages and neighbouring areas accepted as Turkish Cypriot estates, were formerly Linobambaki activity centers. These include:\n\nBy the second quarter of the nineteenth century, approximately 30,000 Muslims were living in Cyprus, comprising about 35% of the total population. The fact that Turkish was the main language spoken by the Muslims of the island is a significant indicator that the majority of them were either Turkish-speaking Anatolians or otherwise from a Turkic background. Throughout the Ottoman rule, the demographic ratio between Christian \"Greeks\" and Muslim \"Turks\" fluctuated constantly. During 1745–1814, the Muslim Turkish Cypriots constituted the majority on the island compared to the Christian Greek Cypriots, being up to 75% of the total island population. However, by 1841, Turks made up 27% of the island's population. One of the reasons for this decline is because the Turkish community were obliged to serve in the Ottoman army for years, usually away from home, very often losing their lives in the endless wars of the Ottoman Empire. Another reason for the declining population was because of the emigration trend of some 15,000 Turkish Cypriots to Anatolia in 1878, when the Ottoman Turks handed over the administration of the island to Britain.\n\nBritish Cyprus\n\nBy 1878, during the Congress of Berlin, under the terms of the Anglo-Ottoman Cyprus Convention, the Ottoman Turks had agreed to assign Cyprus to Britain to occupy and rule, though not to possess as sovereign territory. According to the first British census of Cyprus, in 1881, 95% of the island's Muslims spoke Turkish as their mother tongue. As of the 1920s, the percentage of Greek-speaking Muslims had dropped from 5%, in 1881, to just under 2% of the total Muslim population. During the opening years of the twentieth century Ottomanism became an ever more popular identity held by the Cypriot Muslim intelligentsia, especially in the wake of the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Increasing numbers of Young Turks who had turned against Sultan Abdul Hamid II sought refuge in Cyprus. A rising class of disgruntled intellectuals in the island's main urban centres gradually began to warm to the ideas of positivism, freedom and modernization. Spurred on by the rising calls for \"enosis\", the union with Greece, emanating from Greek Cypriots, an initially hesitant \"Turkism\" was also starting to appear in certain newspaper articles and to be heard in the political debates of the local intelligentsia of Cyprus. In line with the changes introduced in the Ottoman Empire after 1908, the curricula of Cyprus's Muslim schools, such as the \"Idadi\", were also altered to incorporate more secular teachings with increasingly Turkish nationalist undertones. Many of these graduates in due course ended up as teachers in the growing number of urban and rural schools that had begun to proliferate across the island by the 1920s.\n\nIn 1914 the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War against the Allied Forces and Britain annexed the island. Cyprus's Muslim inhabitants were officially asked to choose between adopting either British nationality or retaining their Ottoman subject status; about 4,000–8,500 Muslims decided to leave the island and move to Turkey. Following its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire were faced with the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) whereby the Greek incursion into Anatolia aimed at claiming what Greece believed to be historically Greek territory. For the Ottoman Turks of Cyprus, already fearing the aims of enosis-seeking Greek Cypriots, reports of atrocities committed by the Greeks against the Turkish populations in Anatolia, and the Greek Occupation of Smyrna, produced further fears for their own future. Greek forces were routed in 1922 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who, in 1923, proclaimed the new Republic of Turkey and renounced irredentist claims to former Ottoman territories beyond the Anatolian heartland. Muslims in Cyprus were thus excluded from the nation-building project, though many still heeded Atatürk's call to join in the establishment of the new nation-state, and opted for Turkish citizenship. Between 1881 and 1927 approximately 30,000 Turkish Cypriots emigrated to Turkey.\n\nThe 1920s was to prove a critical decade in terms of stricter ethno-religious compartments; hence, Muslim Cypriots who remained on the island gradually embraced the ideology of Turkish nationalism due to the impact of the Kemalist Revolution. At its core were the Kemalist values of secularism, modernization and westernization; reforms such as the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet, adoption of western dress and secularization, were adopted voluntarily by Muslim Turkish Cypriots, who had been prepared for such changes not just by the Tanzimat but also by several decades of British rule. Many of those Cypriots who until then had still identified themselves primarily as Muslims began now to see themselves principally as Turks in Cyprus.\n\nBy 1950, a Cypriot Enosis referendum in which 95.7% of Greek Cypriot voters supported a fight aimed at enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece were led by an armed organisation, in 1955, called EOKA by Georgios Grivas which aimed at bringing down British rule and uniting the island of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots had always reacted immediately against the objective of enosis; thus, the 1950s saw many Turkish Cypriots who were forced to flee from their homes. In 1958, Turkish Cypriots set up their own armed group called Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) and by early 1958, the first wave of armed conflict between the two communities began; a few hundred Turkish Cypriots left their villages and quarters in the mixed towns and never returned.\n\nRepublic of Cyprus\n\nBy 16 August 1960 the island of Cyprus became an independent state, the Republic of Cyprus, with power sharing between the two communities under the 1960 Zurich agreements, with Britain, Greece and Turkey as Guarantor Powers. Archbishop Makarios III was elected as president by the Greek Cypriots and Dr. Fazıl Küçük was elected as vice-president by the Turkish Cypriots. However, in December 1963, in the events known as \"Bloody Christmas\", when Makarios III attempted to modify the Constitution, Greek Cypriots initiated a military campaign against the Turkish Cypriots and began to attack Turkish inhabited villages; by early 1964, the Turkish Cypriots started to withdraw into armed enclaves where the Greek Cypriots blockaded them, resulting in some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots becoming refugees, or internally \"displaced persons\". This resulted in the UN peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, being stationed on the island as well as an external migration trend of thousands more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom, Turkey, North America and Australia. With the rise to power of the Greek military junta, a decade later, in 1974, a group of right-wing Greek nationalists, EOKA B, who supported the union of Cyprus with Greece, launched a putsch. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed. The Turkish invasion resulted in the occupation of some 37% of the island in the north. After the Turkish invasion and the ensuing 1975 Vienna agreements, 60,000 Turkish Cypriots who lived in the south of the island fled to the north. The 1974–1975 movement was strictly organised by the Provisional Turkish Administration who tried to preserve village communities intact.\n\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\n\nIn 1983 the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in the north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which remains internationally unrecognised, except by Turkey. In 2004, a referendum for the unification of the island, the \"Annan Plan\", was accepted by 65% of Turkish Cypriots but rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots.\n\nCulture\n\nThe Turkish Cypriots are Turkish-speaking, regard themselves as secular Muslims, and take pride in their Ottoman heritage. However, Turkish Cypriots differentiate themselves from mainlanders, especially from the religiously conservative settlers who have come to Cyprus more recently, but their strong connection to Turkey is nonetheless undisputed. Hence, the Turkish Cypriot identity is based on their ethnic Turkish roots and links to mainland Turkey, but also to their Cypriot character with cultural and linguistic similarities with Greek Cypriots. Their culture is heavily based on family ties linked to parents, siblings, and relatives; one's neighbourhood is also considered important as emphasis is given on helping those in need. Thus, much of their lives revolves around social activities, and food is a central feature of gatherings. Turkish Cypriot folk dances, music, and art are also integral parts of their culture.\n\nReligion\n\nThe majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. However, the secularizing force of Kemalism has also exerted an impact on Turkish Cypriots. Religious practices are considered a matter of individual choice and many do not actively practice their religion. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised at a young age in accordance with religious beliefs, although, this practice appears more related to custom and tradition than to powerful religious motivation.\n\nThe social/religious phenomenon of crypto-Christianity was observed in Cyprus, as in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The crypto-Christians of Cyprus were known as Linobambaki (= of linen and cotton). They are mentioned by foreign travellers as Turks who are secretly Greeks, observing the Greek Orthodox fasting (Turner 1815), drinking wine, eating pork and often taking Christian wives.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots' knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together.\n\nAccording to Prof. C. F. Beckingham (1957), in Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not always coincide. There were \"Turkish\", i.e. Muslim villages in which the normal language was Greek. Among them were Lapithiou, Platanisto, Ayios Simeon Beckingham said that this phenomenon has not been adequately investigated.{{sfn|Beckingham|1957|p=166|ps=:In Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not quite coincide. While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithiou (P i), Platanisso (F i), Ayios Simeon (F i) and Galinoporni (F i). This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education, the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as a matter of national pride. On the other hand, many Turks, whose mother tongue is Turkish, learn Greek because they find it useful to understand the language of the majority, though it is much less common for them to write it correctly}} The existence of Greek-speaking Muslims is also mentioned in subsequent works. Ozan Gülle (2014), \"it is historically well documented that Turkish Cypriots showed large differences in their frequency of communication in Cypriot Greek [...]: On one end of the spectrum are Turkish Cypriots who were probably monolingual Cypriot Greek speakers or had only little competency in Turkish, ...\".\n\nThe linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, following the division of Cyprus into a Greek south and a Turkish north. Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. Nonetheless, a Turkish speaker familiar with the Cypriot Turkish variety of Turkish can still easily identify a member of the community from one who is not. Although many Turkish Cypriots command standard Turkish as well, they generally choose to use their own variety in particular contexts to affirm their identity. Most commonly, these differences are in pronunciation, but they extend to lexicon and grammatical structures as well. There are many words used by Turkish Cypriots that originate in the particular historical circumstances of the island, including English and Greek, and therefore have no precedent in standard Turkish. There are also words used by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities which are authentically Cypriot in origin.\n\nMusic and dances\n\nFolk music and dancing is an integral part of social life among Turkish Cypriots. Traditional Turkish Cypriot folk dances can be divided into five categories: Karsilamas, Sirtos, Zeybeks, Ciftetellis/Arabiyes, and Topical Dances (such as Orak, Kozan, Kartal and Topal). The folk dancing groups usually have performances during national festivals, weddings, Turkish nights at hotels and within tourism areas.\n\nDemographics\n\nDebates on the Turkish Cypriot population in the 1970s\nThe 1960 census of Cyprus reported the Turkish Cypriot population as 18% of the total population. The figure was challenged at in a 1978 debate in the British Parliament when Lord Spens stated that there were 400,000 Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, at least one-fifth of the population.\n\n2006 Census\nAccording to the 2006 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 145,443 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Of the Cypriot-born population, 120,007 had both parents born in Cyprus; 12,628 had one of their parents born in Cyprus and the other born in another country. Thus, 132,635 Turkish Cypriots had at least one parent born in Cyprus.\n\n2011 Census\nAccording to the 2011 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 160,207 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in North Cyprus (TRNC).\n\nDiaspora\n\nThere was significant Turkish Cypriot emigration from the island during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly to Great Britain, Australia, and Turkey. Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.\n\nA more recent estimate, in 2011, by the Home Affairs Committee states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000. Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia, 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.\n\nTurkey\n\nThe first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the First World War, and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the Second World War in the 1940s and during the Cyprus conflict of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nInitially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land. The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown. The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000–6,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.\n\nMetin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:\n\nSt. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the Second World War (1939–1945). According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878 and 1945. By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey's Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu, at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: \n\nBy 2001 the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey.\n\nPalestine\nTurkish Cypriots who remained in Cyprus during the early twentieth century were faced with the harsh economic conditions of the Great Depression under British rule. Consequently, many families in the poorest villages, facing debt and starvation, married off their daughters to Arabs mainly in British Palestine, and other Arab countries, in the hope that they would have a better life. A bride price was normally given by the groom to the family of the girls, usually about £10-20, enough to buy several acres of land at the time, as part of the marriage arrangements.. Such payments had not been part of Cypriot tradition, and Cypriots typically describe the girls in these forced marriages as having been \"sold\"; Arabs however, often object to this characterization. Mostly between the ages of 11–18, the majority of the girls lost contact with their families in Cyprus, and while some had successful marriages and families, others found themselves little more than domestic servants, abused, or ended up working in brothels.\n\nThe marriages were sometimes arranged by brokers, who presented the prospective husbands as wealthy doctors and engineers. However, Neriman Cahit, in her book Brides for Sale, found that in reality many of these men had mediocre jobs or were already married with children. Unaware of these realities, Turkish Cypriot families continued to send their daughters to Palestine until the 1950s. Cahit estimates that within 30 years up to 4,000 Turkish Cypriot women were sent to Palestine to be married to Arab men.\n\nIn recent years second and third generation Palestinians of Turkish Cypriot origin have been applying for Cypriot citizenship; several hundred Palestinians have already been successful in obtaining Cypriot passports.\n\nIn 2012 Yeliz Shukri and Stavros Papageorghiou secured financial support for the making of a film on the subject of the \"Forgotten Brides\". The documentary, entitled Missing Fetine, was released in 2018, and follows the search of Australian-born Turkish Cypriot Pembe Mentesh for her long-lost great-aunt, while investigating the fate of these Turkish Cypriot women.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTurkish Cypriot migration to the United Kingdom began in the early 1920s, the British Empire having formally annexed Cyprus in 1914, with the residents of British-ruled Cyprus becoming subjects of the Crown. Some arrived as students and tourists, while others left the island due to the harsh economic and political life during the British colony of Cyprus. Emigration to the United Kingdom continued to increase when the Great Depression of 1929 brought economic depression to Cyprus, with unemployment and low wages being a significant issue. During the Second World War, the number of Turkish run cafes increased from 20 in 1939 to 200 in 1945 which created a demand for more Turkish Cypriot workers. Throughout the 1950s, Turkish Cypriots emigrated for economic reasons and by 1958 their number was estimated to be 8,500. Their numbers continued to increase each year as rumours about immigration restrictions appeared in much of the Cypriot media.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the arrival of many Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom due to political reasons; many began to flee as a result of the EOKA struggle and its aim of \"enosis\". Once the ethnic cleansing broke out in 1963, and some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced, accounting to about a fifth of their population. The political and economic unrest in Cyprus, after 1964, sharply increased the number of Turkish Cypriot immigrants to the United Kingdom. Many of these early migrants worked in the clothing industry in London, where both men and women could work together; many worked in the textile industry as sewing was a skill which the community had already acquired in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots were concentrated mainly in the north-east of London and specialised in the heavy-wear sector, such as coats and tailored garments. This sector offered work opportunities where poor knowledge of the English language was not a problem and where self-employment was a possibility.\n\nOnce the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the division of the island led to an economic embargo against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Republic of Cyprus. This had the effect of depriving the Turkish Cypriots of foreign investment, aid and export markets; thus, it caused the Turkish Cypriot economy to remain stagnant and undeveloped. Due to these economic and political issues, an estimated 130,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated from Northern Cyprus since its establishment to the United Kingdom.\n\nGenetic studies\nAccording to genetic studies, there are close connections between modern Anatolian and Cypriot populations. A 2016 study, which focused on patrilineal ancestry, found that among the sampled Near Eastern and Southeastern European populations, Turkish Cypriots had the shortest genetic distances with those from Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Greece, and Sicily.\n\nA 2017 study found that both Turkish Cypriots' and Greek Cypriots' patrilineal ancestry derives primarily from a single pre-Ottoman local gene pool. The frequency of total haplotypes shared between Turkish and Greek Cypriots is 7-8%, with analysis showing that none of these are found in Turkey, thus not supporting a Turkish origin for the shared haplotypes. No shared haplotypes were observed between Greek Cypriots and mainland Turkish populations, while total haplotypes shared between Turkish Cypriots and mainland Turks is 3%. Turkish Cypriots also share haplotypes with North Africans to a lesser extent, and have Eastern Eurasian haplogroups (H, C, N, O, Q) – attributed to the arrival of the Ottomans – at a frequency of ~5.5%. Both Cypriot groups show close genetic affinity to Calabrian (southern Italy) and Lebanese patrilineages. The study states that the genetic affinity between Calabrians and Cypriots can be explained as a result of a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution, while Lebanese affinity can be explained through several migrations that took place from coastal Levant to Cyprus from the Neolithic (early farmers), the Iron Age (Phoenicians), and the Middle Ages (Maronites and other Levantine settlers during the Frankish era). The predominant haplogroups among both Turkish and Greek Cypriots are J2a-M410, E-M78, and G2-P287.\n\nIn a 2019 genome-wide study, Cypriot samples grouped with people from the Levant (Druze, Lebanese and Syrians) and Armenia among the sampled populations from Eurasia and Africa, using cluster analysis based on haplotype-sharing patterns.\n\nHomozygous beta thalassemia in a number of at-risk populations (Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greeks, Continental Italians and Sardinians) has been prevented at the population level by programmes based on carrier screening, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.\n\nNotable Turkish Cypriots\n\nIn Cyprus\n\nIn the diaspora\n\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\nTurkish Cypriot representatives of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) elected in the Assembly of 1960 partnership government: 1961–1964: Halit Ali Riza, 1961–1963: Umit Suleyman,\n1963–1964: Burhan Nalbantoglu.\n\nTurkish Cypriot representatives of PACE elected in the Assembly of Northern Cyprus: \n(TCs have 2 seats in PACE; the parties of elected members are shown) 2005–2007: CTP Özdil Nami; UBP Hüseyin Özgürgün; 27.01.2011 CTP Mehmet Caglar; UBP Ahmet Eti; 04.12.2013 CTP Mehmet Caglar, UBP Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu\n\nSee also\n Turkish Cypriot diaspora\n Northern Cypriot passport\n List of Turkish Cypriots \n List of Cypriots \n Cypriot refugees\n Greek Cypriots\n Turkish minorities in the former Ottoman Empire, neighbouring communities:\nTurkish Bulgarians\nTurkish Egyptians\nTurkish Iraqis \nTurkish Lebanese\nTurkish Meskhetians \nTurkish Syrians \nTurkish Western Thracians\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n .\n . \n.\n .\n .\n .\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n .\n .\n.\n.\n.\n\n .\n.\n.\n.\n .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \n.\n.\n \n.\n.\n\n .\n.\n\n.\n\nFurther reading\n\n Baybars, Taner, Plucked in a far-off land, London: Victor Gollancz, 1970.\n Beckingham, C.

Although the majority of the population of Cyprus is Greek-speaking, the Turkish Cypriots constitute a significant minority on the island, forming roughly 18% of its population. The Turkish Cypriots are native to Cyprus and have strong cultural ties to Turkey, with around half the population having emigrated from the mainland in the wake of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Most Turkish Cypriots live in the part of the island which is under the control of the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while a significant number also reside in mainland Turkey and other countries such as the United Kingdom (where the largest diaspora population resides). The Turkish Cypriots have had a turbulent history of displacement and conflict, having been caught in the middle of tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots dating back to Ottoman Empire rule of the island. During the 1960s, tensions between the two ethnic Cypriot communities on the island climaxed in inter-communal violence, eventually leading to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. This saw the displacement of many Turkish Cypriots from the island, with a significant proportion of them relocating to mainland Turkey and other countries. The Turkish Cypriots have maintained a distinct cultural identity since their displacement and continue to speak their native languages of Turkish, Cypriot Turkish and Cypriot Greek. They are predominantly Muslim, with Sunni Islam being the most widely practised religion within the community. This is in contrast to the Greek Cypriot majority which largely follows Eastern Orthodoxy. The economy of Northern Cyprus, where the majority of the Turkish Cypriot community resides, is largely dependent on aid from Turkey due to its disputed status. This has led to a large influx of foreign capital and investment, leading to an improvement in the financial position of many Turkish Cypriots. Turkish Cypriots have also started to move back to the southern side of the island as a result of the understanding between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, with the first bus crossing the Green Line in April 2003. The Turkish Cypriots remain subject to political and social tension due to their disputed status on the island and their minority status in the Republic of Cyprus. They continue to work closely with the Turkish government and together they actively seek to improve the situation of the Turkish Cypriot people, both at home and abroad.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 934562}

Its body and dorsal forewings are a deep green color. The dorsal hindwings have purple-blue patches, yellow borders, and a red spot near the inner margin. The underside is yellow green and gray purple. Like most moths in the family Sphingidae, caterpillars pupate in burrows. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found from Argentina north through Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies to Florida, Mississippi, South Texas, Arizona, and Colombia. Occasionally winds carry them to other places, such as Missouri, southern Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maine, and southern Saskatchewan.\n\nLife cycle\nFemale adults lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plant, mainly grapes (Vitis), and vine (Cissus). Caterpillars hatch and start eating, resembling the head of a snake. When they are ready to pupate, they climb down their host plant and burrow underground. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone odor plume. Adults probably feed on flower nectar.\n\nSubspecies\nEumorpha labruscae labruscae\nEumorpha labruscae yupanquii (Kernbach, 1962) (Galápagos Islands)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSpecies description\nTwo pictures\n\nEumorpha\nMoths described in 1758\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus\nMoths of North America\nSphingidae of South America\nMoths of South America", "machine_text": " Eumorpha labruscae, is a species of moth in the Sphingidae family. It is the most commonly seen sphingid hawk moth in North America. Native to the northern hemisphere, it ranges from North America to Europe to some regions of China, although due to its large geographic range, different subspecies of the moth occur in these regions. The adult moth reaches an average wingspan of 4 to 5 cm and has a characteristic black, white and gray pattern on the forewings, with a small black circle marking the middle of each forewing. The hindwings are usually a uniform gray. The caterpillar is most notable for its green body and its orange-yellow tubercles along the body. The distinctive feature of the caterpillar is the saddle-shaped white line that crosses it. Eumorpha labruscae feeds mostly on the nectar of plants such as nightshade, citrus, and convolvulus, but has also been found to feed on the sap from cherry and maple trees. The caterpillars feed chiefly on a number of plant species, such as the common morning glory and Virginia creeper. Since E. labruscae is found across a wide range of habitats, it is not considered a threatened species and there is no conservation concern. The species has long been known to entomologists and has been studied extensively, particularly in regards to its host plants, behavioral patterns and relationship with humans. The moth has been known to inhabit urban and rural areas, and it is commonly found near cities, where host plants are abundant. Researchers have reported that E. labruscae moths are sensitive to air pollutants, and are more likely to avoid areas where levels of air pollution are relatively high. E. labruscae remains an important species to study due to its wide range, occurrences in many different habitats, and diverse behavior. This work is providing crucial information about the ecology and behavior of this species, and better understanding of the moth’s distribution and population status can help inform future conservation efforts.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Antares\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Antares (pronounced  ), designated α Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii), is on average the fifteenth-brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a slow irregular variable star that ranges in brightness from apparent magnitude +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as spectral type M1.5Iab-Ib, Antares is a red supergiant, a large evolved massive star and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the Solar System, it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times that of the Sun.\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association, the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, located at the rim of the Upper Scorpius part illuminating the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex in its foreground. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about  from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a binary star, with its two components called α Scorpii A and α Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot main sequence star of magnitude 5.5.\n\nNomenclature\n\nα Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation. Antares has the Flamsteed designation 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the Bright Star Catalogue and HD 148478 in the Henry Draper Catalogue. As a prominent infrared source, it appears in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas catalogue as IRAS 16262–2619. It is also catalogued as a double star WDS J16294-2626 and CCDM J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate variable star designation.\n\nIts traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek , meaning \"rival to-Ares\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars. The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early Mesopotamian astronomers which is considered an outdated speculation because the name of this star in Mesopotamian astronomy has always been \"heart of Scorpon\" and it was associated with Goddess Lisi(n). Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after Antar, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems Mu'allaqat. However, the name \"Antares\" is already proven in the Greek culture, e.g. in Ptolemy's Almagest and Tetrabiblos. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Antares for the star α Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nObservation \nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at opposition to the Sun. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator.\n\nFor two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky from mid-northern latitudes, because it is near conjunction with the Sun. In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64° northern latitude, the star does not rise at all.\n\nAntares is easier to see from the southern hemisphere due to its southerly declination. In the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64° S latitude.\n\nHistory \nRadial velocity variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century and attempts were made to derive spectroscopic orbits.  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by Johann Tobias Bürg during an occultation on April 13, 1819, although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer James William Grant FRSE while in India on 23 July 1844. It was rediscovered by Ormsby M. Mitchel in 1846, and measured by William Rutter Dawes in April 1847.\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.  The brightness has been monitored by the American Association of Variable Star Observers since 1945, and it has been classified as an LC slow irregular variable star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or  days. No separate long secondary period has been detected, although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').\n\nOccultations and conjunctions \n\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the ecliptic, one of four first magnitude stars within 6° of the ecliptic (the others are Spica, Regulus and Aldebaran), so it can be occulted by the Moon. The occultation of 31 July 2009 was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares. Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar nodes. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. Venus, but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400. Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares. Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass south of the star.\n\nIllumination of Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex \nAntares illuminates foreground parts of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The illuminated cloud is sometimes referred to as the Antares Nebula or is otherwise identified as VdB 107, Ced 132, DG 141, LBN 1107 and Magakian 668.\n\nStellar system\nα Scorpii is a double star that is thought to form a binary system. The best calculated orbit for the stars is still considered to be unreliable.  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a semi-major axis of about .  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit, to 2,562 years for a simple Kepler's Law estimate.\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about  apart in 1847–49, or  apart in 1848.  More modern observations consistently give separations around . The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion, but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.\n\nThe pair have a projected separation of about 529 astronomical units (AU) (≈ 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over  beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).\n\nAntares\n\nAntares is a red supergiant star with a stellar classification of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class. Due to the nature of the star, the derived parallax measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately  from the Sun.\n\nThe brightness of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the true bolometric luminosity is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example  and  published in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about , or . Comparison of the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of  and an age of 12 million years (MYr), or an initial mass of  and an age of 11 to 15 MYr. Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as supernovae.\n\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed. In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by 19%. It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind radial velocity changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using interferometry or observing lunar occultations events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 ± 0.1 milliarcseconds has been published. Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a limb-darkened disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as  in 2009 and  in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite's trigonometric parallax of  leads to a radius of about . Older radii estimates exceeding  were derived from older measurements of the diameter, but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths. Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as VY Canis Majoris or VV Cephei A and Mu Cephei.\n\nAntares, like the similarly sized red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion, will almost certainly explode as a supernova, possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.\n\nAntares B\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around , a temperature around , and a radius of about .\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over . It is often described as green, but this is probably either a contrast effect, or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar occultations while Antares is hidden by the Moon.  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.\n\nEtymology and mythology\n\nIn the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In MUL.APIN, which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and denotes the breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara. Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include  from the Arabic قَلْبُ ٱلْعَقْرَبِ . This had been directly translated from the Ancient Greek  .  was a calque of the Greek name rendered in Latin.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Antares may have been known by various names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\"). In ancient Egypt, Antares represented the scorpion goddess Serket (and was the symbol of Isis in the pyramidal ceremonies). It was called tms n hntt \"the red one of the prow\".  \n\nIn Persia Antares was known as Satevis, one of the four \"royal stars\". In India, it with σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii were Jyeshthā (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the nakshatra (Hindu lunar mansions).\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares 心宿二 (Xīnxiù'èr, \"second star of the Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion Xin (心). It was the national star of the Shang Dynasty, and it was sometimes referred to as () because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand call Antares Rēhua, and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rēhua is father of Puanga/Puaka (Rigel), an important star in the calculation of the Māori calendar. The Wotjobaluk Koori people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as Djuit, son of Marpean-kurrk (Arcturus); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (Balayang) as the brother of Bunjil (Altair).\n\nIn culture \n\nAntares appears in the flag of Brazil, which displays 27 stars, each representing a federated unit of Brazil. Antares represents the state of Piauí.\n\nIn Saint Seiya, the popular 1986 manga, the character Milo represents the Scorpius constellation and uses moves and attacks named after its stars - being Antares the strongest one.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Best Ever Image of a Star’s Surface and Atmosphere - First map of motion of material on a star other than the Sun\n\nM-type supergiants\nB-type main-sequence stars\nBinary stars\nSlow irregular variables\nUpper Scorpius\n\nScorpius (constellation)\nAstronomical events in the near future\nScorpii, Alpha\nCD-26 11359\nScorpii, 21\n148478 9\n080763\n6134\nStars with proper names\nTIC objects", "machine_text": " Antares (α Scorpii, α Sco, Alpha Scorpii) is a red supergiant star located in the constellation of Scorpius, around 550 light years from Earth. It is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, and the most luminous star in the constellation Scorpius. Antares is approximately 15,000 times more luminous than the Sun. It is one of the largest known stars, about 650 times the size of the Sun, and it has a mass of about 20 times that of the Sun. Antares is also predicted to become a red supergiant star, which means that it will eventually become larger and brighter. Antares is believed to be between 12 and 11 million years old, and is classified as a Wolf-Rayet star, a rare type of star that is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It is also a variable star, meaning its brightness and color can fluctuate over time, and it is estimated to have an average magnitude of 0.96. Antares is known for its deep crimson color, which is the result of its high carbon monoxide content. It is visible to the naked eye, and can easily be seen in the night sky during the summer months. Antares is part of a double star system, meaning two stars orbit each other around a central point. The other star, called Antares B, is believed to be a red dwarf or a white dwarf. Antares A and Antares B are separated by a distance of 452 astronomical units. Antares is believed to be a key source of interstellar dust and gas, and its strong stellar wind creates a bow shock in the interstellar medium that can be seen in the form of the much brighter nebula, the Lagoon Nebula. Antares is an interesting celestial phenomenon, and continues to fascinate astronomers and the public alike. Its impressive size and unique characteristics have given it a considerable measure of notoriety, and it has even been used as an icon for various space-related programs.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3076}

It is a fun game that can be played by both adults and children alike. Though the game has its roots in the Punjab, it is increasingly being introduced in other parts of the world via a network of folklorists, teachers, and game enthusiasts. Bharo Mazara is commonly played in rural villages and towns. The game is often referred to as a game of “skill and luck” due to the different levels of skill involved in the game. The objective of the game is to remove or exchange tiles while avoiding “slams” or “mazara”, which occur when two adjacent tiles are claimed. When this occurs, the player responsible for the slam is required to take all of the tiles on the board and the game is over. The game is traditionally played on a “karbi”, or cloth surface, with a 6x6 lattice of small round pieces called “lachhi”. These pieces are divided into two groups, with one group consisting of thirty-two “khulo” pieces and the other consisting of thirty-two “mazra” pieces. The pieces must be put on the surface in a specific order and players take turns moving pieces from one adjacent position to an adjacent position in order to complete a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Each player is limited to one move per turn and the goal is to be the first to completely fill a row or column with the same colour pieces. If a player lands on an unoccupied tile, they may claim that tile, but if a player lands on an occupied tile, they must exchange tiles. Bharo Mazara is a popular Indian folk game that has been passed down through the generations. It is a great way to bring people together, teach problem solving skills, and foster co-operative gameplay among players. It is also a good game to introduce children to the concept of game theory and strategy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52231462}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harvey armor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harvey armor was a type of steel naval armor developed in the early 1890s in which the front surfaces of the plates were case hardened. The method for doing this was known as the Harvey process, and was invented by the American engineer Hayward Augustus Harvey.\n\nThis type of armor was used in the construction of capital ships until superseded by Krupp armor in the late 1890s.  \n\nThe Harvey United Steel Company was a steel cartel whose chairman was Albert Vickers. The year 1894 would see the ten main producers of armor plate, including Vickers, Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, Carnegie and Bethlehem Steel, form the Harvey Syndicate.\n\nPredecessors \nBefore the appearance of compound armor in the 1880s, armor plating  was made from uniform homogeneous iron or steel plates backed by several inches of teak to absorb the shock of projectile impact.  Compound armor appeared in the mid-1880s and was made from two different types of steel, a very hard but brittle high-carbon steel front plate backed by a more elastic low-carbon wrought iron plate.  The front plate was intended to break up an incoming shell, while the rear plate would catch any splinters and hold the armor together if the brittle front plate shattered.\n\nCompound armor was made by pouring molten steel between a red-hot wrought iron backing plate and a hardened steel front plate to weld them together.  This process produced a sharp transition between the properties of the two plates in a very small distance. As  consequence, the two plates could separate when struck by a shell, and the rear plate was often not elastic enough to stop the splinters. With the discovery of nickel-steel alloys in 1889, compound armor was rendered obsolete.\n\nProduction process \nHarvey armor used a single plate of steel, but re-introduced the benefits of compound armor. The front surface was converted to high carbon steel by \"cementing\". In this process, the steel plate would be covered with charcoal and heated to approximately 1200 degrees Celsius for two to three weeks. The process increased the carbon content at the face to around 1 percent; the carbon content decreasing gradually from this level with distance into the plate, reaching the original proportion (approximately 0.1–0.2 percent) at a depth of around an inch. After cementing, the plate was chilled first in an oil bath, then in a water bath, before being annealed to toughen the  back of the plate. The water bath was later replaced with jets of water to prevent the formation of a layer of steam which would insulate the steel from the cooling effect of the water. The process was further improved by low temperature forging of the plate before the final heat treatment.\n\nWhile the American navy used nickel steel for Harvey armor (roughly 0.2 percent carbon, 0.6 percent manganese, 3.5 percent nickel), the British used normal steels since their tests had shown that ordinary steel subjected to the Harvey process had the same resistance to penetration as nickel steel, although it was not quite as tough.\n\nHarvey armor was taken up by all of the major navies, since  of Harvey armor offered the same protection as  of nickel-steel armor.  It was in turn rendered obsolete by the development of Krupp armor in the late 1890s.\n\nSee also\n\nCarburizing\n\nReferences\n\nGene Slover's US Navy Pages - Naval Ordnance and Gunnery\n\nNaval armour", "machine_text": " Harvey armor is a type of historical body armor used almost exclusively by the English and French soldiers in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance era. It was named after the English knight Sir John Harvey, who created the style in the late 15th century. Harvey armor was one of the most advanced types of body armor during this period, offering superior protection from a variety of weapons, from swords to arrows. Harvey armor, like many body armors of the period, was composed of two parts: a breastplate, designed to absorb the impact of arrows and sword blows; and a backplate, which was designed to protect the back and shoulder area. The breastplate was typically made of iron or a type of steel, while the backplate was made of leather, with metal plating over it. The construction of Harvey armor was unique, as the materials used to create it were actually quite light. This was a great advantage, as it enabled the wearer to move more easily and not be encumbered by heavy armor. However, the armor was still strong enough to provide adequate protection during battle. The two pieces of the armor were held together by metal rivets, and sometimes by laces or leather straps. The armor was also decorated with various metals, such as brass and steel. Common decorations included etchings, brass studs, and designs, sometimes with the crest of the wearer's family engraved into it. The most distinguishing feature of Harvey armor was the presence of the \"pauldrons\"; metal plates on the shoulders of the armor which provided additional protection. They could be of varying sizes, depending on the choice of the wearer. The pauldrons also provided additional protection against arrows, as they could catch the arrow's shaft and prevent it from penetrating the body armor. Overall, Harvey armor was highly effective body armor which provided excellent protection during medieval battles and was highly valued by those who wore it. However, it was eventually replaced with newer, more effective body armors, such as plate armor. Nevertheless, the design and construction of Harvey armor still remains impressive and is highly sought after by historical re-enactment enthusiasts today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3989449}

The case remains unsolved with the murderers are still being unknown.\n \nDue to typical bureaucratic reasons and no for substantive, Manolis Sfakianakis wasn't brought to trial for arbitrary abuse of power offense and obstruction of justice, because this criminal charge has removed from the new Criminal Code of Greece on 11 June 2019 with the laws 4619/2019 and 4620/2019 when the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece had decided before the effective date of the two laws on 1 July 2019, and before the General Election held on 7 July 2019.\n \nManolis Sfakianakis himself denies any wrongdoing and argued that he does not have any relation with the murder. Lawyer Christos Mylonopoulos, legal representative of Manolis Sfakianakis, he stated, \"The criminal act in which the principal (Manolis Sfakianakis) is accused of committing a crime it can no longer be tried in court and no longer bring criminal charges because this now has been removed from new Criminal Code of Greece\".\n\nTransfer to a different term of office (2016–2017)\nUnder the chairmanship of the Chief of the Hellenic Police Lieutenant General Konstantinos Tsouvalas with the participation of two army Lieutenant Generals, has met the Supreme Council of Assessments of the Hellenic Police Headquarters () considered the (22) Major Generals of the Hellenic Police. The 2016 Annual Assessments for Police Major Generals announced in a press release issued by the Hellenic Police Headquarters on 17 February 2016 by which Manolis Sfakianakis retained to the rank of Major General and he will be assigned Head of the Administrative Support and Human Resources Branch at Hellenic Police’s Headquarters ().\n  \nLater the same day following a press release for 2016 Annual Assessments for Brigadier Generals issued by the Hellenic Police’s Headquarters on 18 February 2016 on which contained an official announcement stated \"it has accepted the action of Manolis Sfakianakis and has been cancelled his assignment at the Administrative Support and Human Resources Branch\".\n   \nThe transfer has attracted intense criticism from a large part of people when was reported in the media with written comments made mostly on Facebook and Twitter. The Members of Parliament Eleftherios Avgenakis (New Democracy), Odysseas Konstantinopoulos (Democratic Coalition), and Georgios Amyras (To Potami) they had submitted a joint question.\n  \nOn 18 February 2016 the Hellenic Police Headquarters sent a written announcement () to Cyber Crime Division, forwarded to a number of officials, in which the 17 February 2016 assignment for Manolis Sfakianakis is rescinded and it has approved the assignment of him to the term of office of Assistant to the Chief of Staff of the Hellenic Police Headquarters (HQ) where it will also be assigned an oversight of the Cyber Crime Division. The vacant position of the Head of the Cyber Crime Division was filled when Police Colonel George Papaprodromou () assigned for the post assumed from 27 May 2016 to 2 November 2018.\n\nOn the 21 February 2016 Eleftheros Typos newspaper’s article, M. Sfakianakis he commented \"If I had not the confidence and support by Prime Minister (Alexis Tsipras), and people’s love, they would have already demobilized me. I am an \"army staff\" but not a \"soldier\". I am Police Major General, as they done for other colleagues, they should have been notified me in the event of transfer assignment. If they were to do that, I would accept directly the assignment of the Head of the Administrative Support and Human Resources Branch. Why did they call me now? They told me you will be assigned Assistant to the Chief of Staff, and I accepted it without any protest\".\n\nIn relating to the transfer of Manolis Sfakianakis, stating for the then Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction, Alternate Minister of Citizen Protection Nikos Toskas has said \"Manolis Sfakianakis has already unduly overdone the tolerance of Hellenic Police with his excessive amount of public media appearances on his own behalf took advantage of his post. In an ordered system it should have no room for conceits. Personal capacity assignments do not exist. No-one can occupy a post over many consecutive years, who not even acquire any ownership right by reason of its prolonged stay at the post. Everyone must respect the rules. But there are other young officers with exceptional knowledge who do not seem and do not have access to mass media. It would be right to offer an access to them. I have absolutely no interest in what political party choice someone is, my concern for police force is that the work must be done. This is not about one person while it should be showcased and valued to all the police members. I am not concerned in the fact if he is accepted the post offered to him. This is standard practice, whether someone agree it or not. M. Sfakianakis has the rank of Police Major General and he could not hold the same post during all ranks because that only post he knows. It is a subject as conformed by Greek police force's hierocracy. Some supporters closest to him in the terms of political expediency they pointing out the unworthily person rather than the worthy […]\", revealed Ministry's dissatisfaction with Manolis Sfakianakis’ acts accusing him of obstruction of justice violating the Code of Ethics following he had interfered his remit breached rules. As a result of disciplinary proceedings will be transferred to other position while he maintains his Major General rank.\n\nNikos Toskas also concluded stating that \"there would be no further tolerance in this regard while his self-promotional actions on duty having worsened, the red lines have already been crossed and there conceits cannot be dealt with\".\n \nMinister of Interior and Administrative Reconstruction Panagiotis Kouroumblis has stated \"I think given to the issue a high emphasis (than what it really is). The assessments it does not detract Mr. Sfakianakis, and because he shall not cease to be an evolving human, to pursue further next year, such a transfer must first be done. The Hellenic Police has its own logic (definite framework of progress by default). If he declines the post offered to him, because he still wants to deal with this objective (cyber crime law enforcement) this is a different matter. Because we have to understand for this particular sector (police force) nobody can be remain permanently in an assignment\".\n\nNonetheless, a one-year later on 21 January 2017, the Supreme Council of Assessments of the Hellenic Police Headquarters at its 2017 Annual Assessments for Major Generals, it decided eventually to discontinue Manolis Sfakianakis from his active duty when it promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General in the form of retirement.\n\nReferences\n\n1963 births\nPeople from Chania\nLiving people", "machine_text": " Manolis Sfakianakis (born 2 March 1964) is a Greek singer-songwriter and performer.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harriet Ward\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harriet Ward née Tidy (1808 – 1873), was a British writer whose work is sometimes thought of as South African literature. She lived in the Cape Colony for a few years and her best-known books are set there: the non-fiction Five Years in Kaffirland and the fictional Jasper Lyle, the first English novel set entirely in South Africa. She also wrote articles for a military audience, unusually for a woman of that era. Her writing has stimulated discussion about whether or not she agreed fully with British colonial attitudes.\n\nPersonal life \nShe was born at Thorp, Norfolk in 1808 to Colonel and Mrs Francis Skelly Tidy, née Miss Pinder, daughter of the Chief Justice of Barbados. After school in France and London she married John Ward in 1831. He was a military officer from Waterford, Ireland and his wife accompanied him on various postings. They had one daughter, Isabel. The family lived together on St Helena in the late 1830s. In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called \"Ceded Territory\". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.\n\nWriting\n\nHer first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in \"Kaffirland\", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.\n\nThis book was well-received in a period of public interest in the \"Kaffir War\" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was \"encumbered\" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as \"truthful and popular\" with a \"fidelity and vivacity\" in its descriptions of \"Kaffir life and scenery\", \"giving it at the present moment an especial interest\". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.\n\nCritics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as \"stridently propagandist\" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a \"veiled critique\" or even deliberately expressing \"anti-colonial dissidence\". One critic thinks she wrote at first with \"full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier\" but later revealed a \"startling mismatch\" with this in her novels.\n\nSelect bibliography\n\nBooks available online \n\n  Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country, to the conclusion of peace.

She moved to the United States with her family when she was nine years old. After the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Ward decided to become a nursing volunteer. She served at the Union-run Nurses Home in New Orleans. After spending six months in New Orleans, Ward joined the United States Sanitary Commission. She was assigned to a military hospital in Alexandria, Virginia. As a part of her work with the Sanitary Commission, Ward took on multiple roles which included nurse and administrator. In 1864, Ward was appointed head nurse of a hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, where she tended to wounded soldiers. She also worked for a boys' camp in Cross Creek, Maryland. In this capacity, she was responsible for providing medical care and supplies to the refugees and freed slaves in the area. After the end of the war, Ward returned to the United States and enrolled at the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing in New York City. She became a staff nurse in 1868 and was promoted to head nurse in 1876. She was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1897 in recognition of her exemplary service as a nurse. After her retirement in 1902, Ward authored several books, including a memoir on her wartime experiences. She gained recognition as one of the earliest nursing pioneers in the United States. At the time of her death in 1927, she was the longest-serving nurse in the United States Sanitary Commission and had been honored for her service. Harriet Ward has been honored for her service in a number of ways. In 1970, a park and playground was dedicated to her in her hometown of Liverpool. In 2004, a monument was unveiled in her honor at the Cross Creek Refugee Camp in Maryland. The Harriet Ward Society is also dedicated to the legacy of the nurse and honoring her wartime service. Ward's legacy as an important figure in early nursing has been commemorated in multiple ways. Her contributions to the field of nursing and her service during the Civil War are remembered and honored by many.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52341230}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hanky Panky (Madonna song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American recording artist Madonna from her soundtrack album I'm Breathless. It was released on June 12, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from a line in the parent film, Dick Tracy, talking about a woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, \"Hanky Panky\" is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke.\n\nThe song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting its lyrical content. It was a commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours: Blond Ambition (1990) and Re-Invention (2004). The song has been covered by several tribute acts and was also performed on the television series Ally McBeal (1997).\n\nBackground and release\nIn 1990, Madonna starred in the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney—a new role introduced for her—with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs written by Stephen Sondheim for the film—\"Sooner or Later\", \"More\" and \"What Can You Lose\"—which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. \"I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel\", she said at the time.\n\nMadonna recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. \"Hanky Panky\" was written and produced by Madonna and Leonard and was released as the second and final single from I'm Breathless on June 12, 1990. The cassette and the 7-inch versions had \"More\", another song from the album as its B-side, while the 12-inch releases had two remixes of the song by Kevin Gilbert. Cover photograph for the single was done by Patrick Demarchelier with Jeri Heiden designing the sleeves.\n\nRecording and composition\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was recorded within the three weeks time taken for the whole project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centred around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a \"good spanking\". It is performed in an almost comical style and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, \"You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me\". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–C–Bm–A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm–A–B9–A7–Dm–C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained:\nThe spanking thing started because I believed that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around with people like Al Pacino's character. Warren [Beatty] asked me to write some songs, and one of them—the hanky-panky song—was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle, I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.\nThe singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line \"I'll settle for the back of your hand\"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song \"highly dangerous\" while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was \"extremely harmful\". Although initially approving of the idea of \"getting spanked\"—even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show—Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.\n\nCritical response\n\nJ. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that \"the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply sounds like a silly innocent romp until you realize what she's going on and on is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!\". The author also felt Madonna sang with \"just a little too much authority\". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it \"a comic hymn to spanking\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a \"double entendre-laden hit\". Bill Coleman from Billboard called it a \"steamy and suggestive jumpin' jive\". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted \"Hanky Panky\" as one of the best tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a \"fake period piece\" but praising its \"risqué s&m-lite\" sound as \"all her\". Ernest Hardy from Cash Box said it \"is a tribute to the pleasures of light S&M, done in a brassy '30s style. Madonna sings in a lower key than ususal, tosses off risque lines, and heads for the top of the charts with barely an effort.\" David Giles from Music Week stated that it \"finds Madonna flirting in a big way with Forties swing music.\" He added, \"Pure Hollywood stuff\". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside \"Cry Baby\" and \"I'm Going Bananas\", was one of the \"more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco\" on the album. He also noted that \"its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour.\" People magazine called it a \"paean to kink\". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it \"goofy (but catchy!)\". In August 2018, Joel Lynch from the same magazine ranked it as the singer's 100th greatest song, calling it an \"enjoyably (and cartoonishly) amorous big-band swing song\" and comparing Madonna's vocals to Betty Boop. Greg Sandow, from Entertainment Weekly, called it a \"delightful challenge to censorship\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt it was a  \"cheeky\" song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s. \n\nStephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a \"big-band blues [song] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage\". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described \"Hanky Panky\" as \"naughty\", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song \"Makin' Whoopee\" by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that \"one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when you push her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' is one of the few pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking.\" For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"it gets points for its boldness and audacity. Yet it never truly rises above its novelty status\". Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B. King believed that the subject matter of \"Hanky Panky\" would surely receive \"flank\", but defended Madonna saying that she had been singing about such topics for years by then.\nThe Huffington Post ranked the song fifth on their list of \"The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs\"; author Pandora Boxx hailed it as \"a great fusion of '90s pop and vintage '30s\", but noted that \"its 'scandalous' subject matter ruffled too many feathers to make it a big hit\". Also from The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs ranked it at number 55 on his list of \"The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles\", calling it \"pure fun, '30s swing style [...] its lyrics are sillier than they ought to be, but the fabulous beat refuses to let your dancing shoes collect dust\". Writing for Gay Star News, Joe Morgan gave a mixed review, calling it \"less sexual and feminist liberation and more corny and blatant [...] A forgettable number that sounds like track six of a musical theatre cast album\". A negative review came from Royal S. Brown, author of Film Musings: A Selected Anthology from Fanfare Magazine, who called it \"ridiculous\". Also negative was The Guardians Jude Rogers, who wrote that \"even creators of brilliant pop can go wrong\", calling it \"over farty\" and \"Madonna's nadir\".\n\nChart performance\nFollowing its release, \"Hanky Panky\" was initially blacklisted at some radio stations when they faced objections from audiences about the lyrical content. Nevertheless, it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 40 the week of June 30, 1990, as \"Vogue\" was descending from the top ten. The single quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number ten the week of July 28, 1990. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 19, 1990, for shipments of 500,000 copies. Billboard ranked it at number 36 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 92 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 18 on the week of September 1, 1990. It was present for a total of 13 weeks on the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and after two weeks, reached its peak of number two the week of July 27, 1990; spent a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on August 1, 1990, for shipments of 200,000 copies. According to the Official Charts Company, the single has sold over 210,000 copies as of October 2010. In Australia, \"Hanky Panky\" debuted at number 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of July 29, 1990, and peaked at number six four weeks later. It was ranked at number 45 on the ARIA year-end chart. In New Zealand, the single debuted at number 23 on RIANZ Singles Chart and, after fluctuating for the next three weeks, reached a peak of number six, becoming Madonna's 18th top-ten single in the country. In the European nations, \"Hanky Panky\" reached the top-ten of the charts in Ireland, as well as topping the charts in Finland. In other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, it managed to peak within the top 20 of the charts.\n\nLive performances and covers\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was first performed on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song dressed in a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer, standing in front of a microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: \"You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?\". Regarding the \"shameless promotion\" of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that \"along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show\". Two different performances  were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.\n\nFourteen years later, Madonna performed an energetic showgirl themed version of \"Hanky Panky\" as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. She appeared onstage dressed in a circus themed outfit, consisting of black hot pants, red high heels, headband and a red and white striped 1920s flapper  style bustier. Sean Piccoli, from the Sun-Sentinel, praised the singer's ability to \"summon the vampy humor of 'Hanky Panky'—a Bette Midler moment if ever [Madonna] had one\". In May 2000, the song was performed by actress Alicia Witt on the third-season finale of the American television series Ally McBeal, titled \"The Musical, Almost\". An Indie cover version by the band Killer Nannies In America, was included on the 2000 tribute album The Material Girl: A Tribute to Madonna. The Gary Tesca Orchestra included an instrumental version of the song on their album Who's That Girl: The Madonna Story, Vol. 1 (2006).\n\nTrack listings and formats\n\nUS and European 7-inch single; Japanese 3-inch CD single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (LP version) – 3:57\n \"More\" (LP version) – 4:59\n\nAustralian, European, and US 12-inch single and CD maxi-single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix) – 6:34\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix) – 3:50\n \"More\" (album version) – 4:59\n\nDigital single (2020)\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix) – 3:50\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix) – 6:36\n \"More\" (LP version) – 4:59\n\nCredits and personnel\n Madonna – writer, vocals, producer\n Patrick Leonard – writer, producer, keyboard\n Jeff Porcaro – drums\n Guy Pratt – bass\n Donna De Lory – background vocals\n Niki Haris – background vocals\n N'Dea Davenport – background vocals\n Kevin McGuilbert – remix and additional production\n Patrick Demarchelier – cover photographer\n Jeri Heiden – designer\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications and sales\n\nSee also\nList of European number-one airplay songs of the 1990s\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\"Hanky Panky\" on Spotify\n\n1990 singles\nMadonna (entertainer) songs\nSongs about BDSM\nSongs written by Madonna (entertainer)\nSongs written by Patrick Leonard\nSong recordings produced by Madonna (entertainer)\nSong recordings produced by Patrick Leonard\nVocal jazz songs\nNumber-one singles in Finland\n1990 songs\nSwing music\nMusic controversies\nAmerican jazz songs\nSire Records singles\nWarner Records singles", "machine_text": " \"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American pop singer Madonna, released as the fifth and final single from her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray, and was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records. It topped the singles chart in Finland and New Zealand, while peaking in the top 5 in the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom. \"Hanky Panky\" is an upbeat dance-pop song with elements of R&B music. The song garnered positive reviews from critics, who commended its production and sound. Commercially, thesingle experienced success mainly in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Finland, where it topped the chart. The single's accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, features Madonna performing a choreographed dance routine in the streets of Miami with a troupe of female back-up dancers. Madonna performed the song on the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987), Re-Invention World Tour (2004) and Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008). In 1985, Madonna was recording songs for her third studio album, True Blue. To complete it, she enlisted the help of producers and writers, including Stephen Bray. Madonna wrote the song inspired by the song \"Willie and the Hand Jive\", released by Johnny Otis in 1958. She stated, \"I thought about doing something like that for a long time...maybe a lot of people joined in and did that kind of a song and dance when it came out. It was just a song that I wanted to hear, basically. I wanted it to be something that people could dance to that was just a little bit naughty on the surface but had a lot of heart\". Bray and Madonna wrote the song, while Bray produced it and contributed with instruments. Bray recalled the session in which the two pieces of music were connected together and formed the song. He stated: “At the end of the day, we stitched together two different pieces of music to make \"Hanky Panky\". I think it was one of the first times we were both actually in the studio at the same time, rather than me supplying the music and her writing lyrics and singing. The single was released worldwide on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records. It was released as 12-inch record format and a cassette. \"Hanky Panky\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics; praising it for its production and sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from All Music Guide called it “an undiscovered gem that should have found her a few more hit singles\". According to him, \"Hanky Panky\" was one of the best singles form True Blue. Stephen Holden from The New York Times called it irresistible and praised Madonna for her \"irresistibly arresting\" vocals. The song experienced success mainly in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Finland, where it topped the chart, with the latter two listing it as the best single of the year. In United States, the song peaKed at number three on Billboard Hot 100. It was placed at number seven on the Billboard's best-selling singles of 1987 chart. In the United Kingdom, it reached number four on UK Singles Chart. The single's accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, premiered in July 1987. It features Madonna and a group of female backup dancers performing a choreographed dance routine in the streets and alleys in Miami. At the beginning of the clip, Madonna and the dancers are seen dancing and singing to \"Hanky Panky\" on a street corner. The clip uses lightning and smoke effects to punctuate the performance. Throughout the video, Madonna appears in a black outfit, incorporating a mesh corset, with a red hat, earrings and necklaces.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3732808}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Prison rape\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Prison rape or jail rape is rape occurring in prison. The phrase is commonly used to describe rape of inmates by other inmates, less commonly to the rape of inmates by staff, and rarely to rape of staff by inmates.\n\nWithin the United States, the overwhelming majority of prison rape cases involve men who are raped by other men.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal, regardless of consent.\n\nChina \nIn February 2021, BBC News reported eyewitness accounts of systematic rape of Uyghur women in the Xinjiang internment camps.\n\nMultiple women who were formerly detained in the Xinjiang internment camps have publicly made accusations of systemic sexual abuse, including rape. Sayragul Sauytbay, a teacher who was forced to work in the camps, told the BBC that employees of the camp in which she was detained conducted rapes en masse, saying that camp guards \"picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away\". She also told the BBC of an organized gang rape, in which a woman around age 21 was forced to make a confession in front of a crowd of 100 other women detained in the camps, before being raped by multiple policemen in front of the assembled crowd. Tursunay Ziawudun, a woman who was detained in the camps for a period of nine months, told the BBC that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" to be raped by Chinese men, and that she was subjected to three separate instances of gang rape while detained. Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, has stated that Chinese police sexually abused detainees during electric shock tortures, saying that \"there were four kinds of electric shock... the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick\".\n\nIran \n\nSexual violence against political prisoners is prevalent in Iran. It is allegedly ignored or even facilitated by authorities.\n\nReports issued to the United Nations allege that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades. During the 1980s, following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's then-deputy, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: \"Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?\" Two prominent members of Iran's human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, opposition groups reported thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons around the country, with former inmates alleging mass rape of men, women and children by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in prisons such as Kahrizak and Evin.\n\nFollowing the 2009 presidential election, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars in Evin Prison had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to former president and cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karroubi said this was a \"fragment\" of the evidence he had and that if the denials did not stop, he would release even more.\n\nOn 9 August 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible torture and, in particular, sexual harassment of men and women. On 19 August, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to \"personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak.\" Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected his claims and Ali Khamenei's representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.\n\nTurkey \n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both released reports of widespread rape and abuse of prisoners in Turkey spanning multiple decades. Kurdish prisoners have also been specifically targeted for rape and other forms of sexual violence.\n\nMiddle East \nRape is regularly used in prisons across the wider Middle East. Sexual abuse of detained women, children and men is rampant in UAE, Saudi and Bahraini prisons.\n\nUnited States \n\nPublic awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development, and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely for decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped.\n\nA United States Department of Justice report, titled Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, states that: “In 2011–12, an estimated 5.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.” However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers, claiming they seem to under-report the real numbers of sexual assaults in prison—especially among juveniles.\n\nA 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conjectured that between 9% and 20% of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Studies in 1982 and 1996 concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12% and 14%. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23% for maximum security prisons in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.\n\nThe Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on 4 September 2003.\n\nSee also\nTeardrop tattoo\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nGoodmark, Leigh and Flores, Juanita and Goldscheid, Julie and Ritchie, Andrea and SpearIt, Plenary 2 – Redefining Gender Violence—Transcripts from Converge!

Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2628984", "machine_text": " Prison rape is the act of sexual violence, usually non-consensual, which occurs when an individual is subjected to unwanted sexual contact while in prison. It is a form of sexual assault, typically perpetrated upon inmates who are either incarcerated for long sentences or those who are particularly vulnerable, such as juveniles, the mentally ill, or the physically incapacitated. The Bureau of Justice Statistics issued a report in 2009 that revealed that 93,000 inmates reported being victim of sexual assaults by another inmate or staff member while in prison. This report was the product of two separate surveys given to inmates over a two-year period. The data was collected by means of one-on-one interviews with inmates who had been victimized. It was found that most offenders were male and that most of the victims were younger inmates. The majority of prisoners who had reported assaults said that their assault was perpetrated by another inmate. Historically, most prisons have held male inmates; however, increasing numbers of women are sent to prison and face sexual violence. The Bureau of Justice Statistics issued a report in 2006 that revealed that 4 percent of female inmates in state prison surveyed reported that they were victims of sexual violence by a staff member of the institution, compared to 0.7 percent of males. The responses to such occurrences are limited, as many inmates fear reprisals or further victimization if they report the incident. It is not uncommon for inmates to suffer psychological problems and life-long consequences when they are subjected to rape in prison. Unfortunately, there is often a \"prison culture\" that condones and even encourages the act of sexual violence. The issue of prison rape has been the topic of attention in the U.S. since the 1970s. Programs to reduce prison rape include, but are not limited to, implementing codes of conduct, providing guards with training aimed to prevent, recognize, and respond to sexual violence, placing inmates in safe houses, as well as implementing disciplinary and medical services for inmates. Taking all these efforts into consideration, a comprehensive approach is necessary to address the problem of prison rape. Despite increased attention, research suggests that sexual violence in prison is still a reality. Further research is needed to understand the impact of prison rape, and for the sake of victim safety, it is necessary to address the causes of this violence. In the meanwhile, both inmates and staff need to be properly trained and held accountable for irresponsible and criminal behaviors that serve to further victimize people in prison.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21484134}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shot hole disease\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shot hole disease (also called Coryneum blight) is a serious fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and concentric lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes shot hole disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.\n\nHosts and symptoms\n\nThe fungal pathogen Wilsonomyces carpophilus affects members of the Prunus genera. Almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, prune and cherry trees can be affected. Both edible and ornamental varieties are vulnerable to infection. Almost all over-ground parts of the plants are affected including the fruits, buds and the stems, but the damage is most noticeable on the leaves. The symptoms begin with small (1/10-1/4”) reddish or purplish-brown spots with light green or yellow ring around them. As the disease progresses the damaged areas become slightly larger and then dry up and fall away, leaving BB-sized holes behind. As the fungus spreads, more leaf tissue is damaged until the leaf falls. Significant infections can reduce the amount of photosynthesis that can occur, weakening the plant, and decreasing fruit production. The infection on the fruits in turn begins as small purple spots that develop into gray to white lesions. Gummosis may occur (both on the fruits and the stems as well). These lesions leave toughened spots on the skin, and in some cases the fruit may be lost. Infected buds may appear darker than normal. Branches may develop concentric lesions when infected. These lesions may girdle a twig and kill it.\n\nDisease cycle\nW. carpophilus overwinters in infected buds and in twig cankers. Asexual spores (conidia) are dispersed in spring when moisture levels increase or as a result of overhead watering. Spores are pigmented and remain viable, in a dormant state, for months. Infection can occur any time moisture is present for at least 24 hours, as long as temperatures are above . At higher temperatures, infection occurs more quickly. W. carpophilus infection takes only 6 hours at .\n\nManagement\nW. carpophilus can remain viable for several months and spores are often airborne. Since the fungi thrive in wet conditions, overhead watering should be avoided. Remove and dispose of any infected buds, leaves, fruit and twigs. In fall, fixed copper or Bordeaux mixture can be applied.\n\nImportance\nShot hole disease is a major concern of the stone fruit industry. It is estimated that 80% of the California almond crop may be infested with shot hole disease, resulting in a potential yield loss of 50-75%. In the 1930s, it was found that applications of Bordeaux mixture reduces shot hole disease on peaches from 80% to 9%.\n\nReferences\n\nFungal tree pathogens and diseases\nStone fruit tree diseases", "machine_text": " Shot Hole Disease is a plant disease caused by the pathogen Corythuchinam and is a major problem for many fruit tree ecosystems. The disease is characterized by circular to elliptical spots caused by fungi on the leaves, fruit, and twigs of the host trees. The spots gradually expand until they resemble small “shot holes”. Unfortunately, the disease is often fatal to the host tree and can spread quickly, particularly in environments with high moisture levels. Corythuchinam is an ascomycete fungus and is often referred to as the “shot hole borer”. It is thought to be native to Southeast Asia, but has since spread to other fruit tree ecosystems such as California, Oregon, and Washington. The disease is particularly problematic in California’s Central Valley, where high summer temperatures and humidity levels favor the growth of the pathogen. The disease is spread through spores which can be transported via wind, water, or through pruning tools and infected plant matter. Once in a new environment, the spores latch onto healthy trees and begin to thrive. In an infected tree, the disease begins by gradually causing leaf yellowing and spotting. The spots eventually become circular and eventually give way to “shot holes”. Eventually, twigs and branches will die off, followed by the death of the host tree. As it is often fatal to its host tree, shot hole disease can cause major disruption to local ecosystems. The disease is particularly problematic for commercial growers, as a single orchard can experience near complete losses of their crop due to the disease. To slow the spread of shot hole disease, orchard managers should focus on prevention and early detection. Preventative measures include the use of resistant varieties, prompt pruning of dead and diseased branches, sanitizing pruning tools, and purchasing disease-free planting material. If a tree is already infected, it should be removed immediately to prevent spread. Overall, shot hole disease is a serious problem for many fruit tree ecosystems. If left untreated, it can spread quickly and lead to significant crop losses. To mitigate the disease, it is important to practice preventative measures to reduce chances of infection, and to act swiftly when a tree displays signs of infection.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50346824}

The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad earlier had established a station and picnic ground at Mount Gretna.\n\nHistory \nThe Gilded Age iron industrialist and railroad president Robert Habersham Coleman decided that a  narrow-gauge railroad to the top of nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a  spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of .  Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc  Forney locomotive, were three  \"American\" types (#11, #12 and #15) built by Baldwin Locomotive Works.  Locomotive #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only  gauge s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a  gauge  for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.\n\nRails weighing  were spiked onto the  face of ties   long.  A turntable, engine-house, water tank, runaround track, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna.  Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak.  During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. These eight passenger cars were built by the Jackson & Sharp Company. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down.  The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range.  A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic.  One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously from one side of the car. There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad.  The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.\n\nLocomotives\n\nCornwall and Lebanon Railroad \nThe standard-gauge Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad continued operations as a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later Penn Central Transportation Company until 1972. Hurricane Agnes caused flood damage, preventing operation of trains on the branch, and the damage was not repaired. The branch was converted to the 21st-century Lebanon Valley Rail Trail after the rails were removed.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\n2 ft gauge railways in the United States\nNarrow gauge railroads in Pennsylvania\nRailway lines closed in 1916\nDefunct Pennsylvania railroads", "machine_text": " The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway was an American narrow gauge railroad that operated on a 2.5 mile track near the town of Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1894 by the Cornwall & Lebanon Railroad Company and operated until 1932. The line was constructed to carry tourists and vacationers to the nearby resort town of Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania, which was a summer retreat for many of the Pennsylvania Dutch. The line began operation on May 11, 1894, and consisted of a main line from Cornwall Junction to Mount Gretna, with a halt at the local stage stop at Quentin, a junction spur between Quentin and Hummelstown and various spurs, sidings and switches along the main line. The main line was just over two and a half miles in length and featured two stations, one in Mount Gretna and another at Port Clinton, a nearby summer resort. The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway was a favorite train ride for vacationers. The line offered breathtaking views of the area, including the Conodoguinet Creek, the Conestoga River, and the surrounding hills. Special Sunday excursions to the towns of Middletown, Elizabethtown and Hummelstown were also offered. The line's original locomotives were two 4-4-0 \"American Type\" locomotives from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, designated numbers 1 and 2. An additional 4-4-0, number 3, was purchased in 1898 and a 0-4-4T locomotive, designated number 7, was purchased in 1913. Locomotive number 7 remained in service until the line's closure in 1932. In the early years of operation, freight traffic was important to the line, with coal and agricultural products being transported. Gradually, however, the line's focus shifted to passenger service as the population of Mount Gretna increased, resulting in a boom in tourism. The line struggled financially despite its popularity and was eventually taken over by a passenger operator, the Williamstown Street Railway Company, in 1924. The company operated the line until the Great Depression, at which point it became economically unviable and ceased operations in 1932. The locomotives were sold for scrap and the track removed. Today, all that remains of the Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway are a few artifacts, such as a former station house, a plaque commemorating the line and various pieces of rolling stock. These can be seen on display at the Cornwall Iron Furnace Museum near the junction of the original route.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1199057}

Nefopam was significantly more effective than aspirin as an analgesic in one clinical trial, although with a greater incidence of side effects such as sweating, dizziness and nausea, especially at higher doses. The estimated relative potency of nefopam to morphine indicates that 20 mg of nefopam HCl is the approximate analgesic equal of 12 mg of morphine with comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, or oxycodone, while nefopam tends to produce fewer side effects, does not produce respiratory depression, and has much less abuse potential, and so is useful either as an alternative to opioid analgesics, or as an adjunctive treatment for use alongside opioids or other types of analgesics. Nefopam is also used to treat severe hiccups.\n\nContraindications\nNefopam is contraindicated in people with convulsive disorders, those that have received treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine or isocarboxazid within the past 30 days and those with myocardial infarction pain, mostly due to a lack of safety data in these conditions.\n\nSide effects\nCommon side effects include nausea, nervousness, dry mouth, light-headedness and urinary retention. Less common side effects include vomiting, blurred vision, drowsiness, sweating, insomnia, headache, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, aggravation of angina and rarely a temporary and benign pink discolouration of the skin or erythema multiforme.\n\nOverdose\nOverdose and death have been reported with nefopam. Overdose usually manifests with convulsions, hallucinations, tachycardia, and hyperdynamic circulation. Treatment is usually supportive, managing cardiovascular complications with beta blockers and limiting absorption with activated charcoal.\n\nInteractions \n\nIt has additive anticholinergic and sympathomimetic effects with other agents with these properties. Its use should be avoided in people receiving some types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) as there is the potential for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crises to result.\n\nPharmacology\n\nThe mechanism of action of nefopam and its analgesic effects are not well understood, although inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopamine (that is, acting as an ) is thought to be involved. It also reduces glutamate signaling via modulating sodium and calcium channels.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nThe absolute bioavailability of nefopam is low. It is reported to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations between 49 and 183 nM. The drug is approximately 73% protein-bound across a plasma range of 7 to 226 ng/mL (28–892 nM). The metabolism of nefopam is hepatic, by N-demethylation and via other routes. Its terminal half-life is 3 to 8 hours, while that of its active metabolite, desmethylnefopam, is 10 to 15 hours. It is eliminated mostly in urine, and to a lesser extent in feces.\n\nChemistry\nNefopam is a cyclized analogue of orphenadrine, diphenhydramine, and tofenacin, with each of these compounds different from one another only by the presence of one or two carbons. The ring system of nefopam is a benzoxazocine system.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nRecreational use\nRecreational use of nefopam has rarely been reported, and is far less common than with opioid analgesics.\n\nNames\nIn the 1960s, when it was first developed, it had the generic name fenazoxine.\n\nSee also \n Troparil\n\nReferences \n\nAnalgesics\nDrugs with unknown mechanisms of action\nMuscarinic antagonists\nNitrogen heterocycles\nOxygen heterocycles\nSodium channel blockers", "machine_text": " Nefopam is a medication used to treat acute and chronic pain. It is classified as an anticholinergic analgesic or antispasmodic agent, meaning it blocks the action of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Nefopam is used for a variety of indications, including post-operative pain, labor pain, and chronic back pain. Nefopam was initially developed by Amersham Health in the United Kingdom. It was first approved for use in the European Union in 1981. Since then, it has been approved for use in over 30 countries, including Australia and Mexico. Nefopam works by blocking the pain signals sent by acetylcholine. This inhibits the transmission of information between the brain and the body, resulting in a decrease in pain perception. Nefopam is not used as a first line treatment for pain, as its effectiveness is not always reliable and its use can be associated with adverse effects. Nefopam is generally taken orally in tablet form. It has a quick onset of action and its peak effect can be seen in 30 minutes after administration. The drug has a short half-life of approximately 1.5 hours and is rapidly metabolized and excreted by the kidneys and liver. Common side effects associated with Nefopam use include drowsiness, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and constipation. Serious side effects are rare, but can occur in rare cases, including allergic reactions, severe skin rash, and anaphylactic shock. It should not be used in people with glaucoma, as it can worsen the condition. Nefopam is an effective way to manage pain, but due to its potential for side effects, it should be used cautiously. It has a narrow therapeutic window, meaning that small changes in the dosage can result in major changes in its effectiveness.

It was discovered by American astronomer reverend Joel Metcalf at Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, on 13 September 1907.\n\nThe S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis from the 1980s and a provisional observation in 2004 rendered a rotation period of 32.6 and 34.4 hours, respectively.\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the U.S.Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has a dissimilar albedo in the range of 0.14 to 0.23, which leads to a varying estimate for its diameter from 28 to 36 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link publishes an albedo of 0.23 from an alternative result of the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey (SIMPS) and derives a slightly lower diameter of 27.9 kilometers.\n\nThe minor planet was named for two women of ancient Roman history. Agrippina the Elder (14 BCE – 33) was the daughter of the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the wife of Germanicus and the mother of the Emperor Caligula. Her daughter, Agrippina the Younger (15–59 AD) was the mother of Emperor Nero. The naming might be influenced by the two letters of the provisional designation 1907 AG. In the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel supposes that the name originated from a list of female names from mythology and history, compiled by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) in 1913. The ARI then sent this list to a number of astronomers with the request to name their discoveries in order to avoid confusion, as the number of unnamed minor planet up to number 700 had grown significantly at the time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR – Observatoire de Genève, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) – Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\nBackground asteroids\nAgrippina\nAgrippina\nAgrippina\nS-type asteroids (Tholen)\n19070913", "machine_text": " 645 Agrippina (provisional designation: 1984 MN) is a Main belt asteroid discovered on July 3, 1984, by the Spacewatch program at the Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona. The asteroid is named after Agrippina the Elder, the mother of Roman Emperor Caligula (37-41 AD). The asteroid measures approximately 17 kilometers in diameter. It has a low albedo, indicating that its surface is composed of dark, non-reflective materials. 645 Agrippina has an orbital period of 3.25 years and follows a slightly eccentric orbit. The spectrum of 645 Agrippina reveals that it is an oblique S-type asteroid. This classification is based on its low albedo and olivine-pyroxene composition. These features are typical of most S-type asteroids, which are also known as silicaceous asteroids. S-type asteroids count for more than 75 percent of all asteroids in the main belt and most of them originate from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. The asteroid's spectral type was determined using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and from ground-based near-infrared measurements obtained at the ESO La Silla Observatory, Chile. Further photometric studies obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has allowed for a spin axis estimation for 645 Agrippina. Rotational lightcurve of 645 Agrippina was obtained from photometric observations made over a period of two weeks and showed that the asteroid had a rotation period of 3.2 hours and an amplitude of 0.2 magnitude. In July 2006, the first radar observations of 645 Agrippina were made at the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico. The results of the observations showed that the asteroid has a diameter of 16.87 kilometers and an estimated mean density of 2.4 g/cm3. Since 645 Agrippina's discovery, its orbital position has been monitored by the Minor Planet Center, an organization of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that is responsible for the collection, analysis and dissemination of observational data regarding minor planets and comets.

From Styx's \"Fooling Yourself,\" to Survivor's \"Eye Of The Tiger,\" the Arch Allies' setlist covered their greatest hits as well as some of the hottest tunes from the era. The album was released on December 19, 2000, as a double disc, one DVD and one CD. The DVD of the show includes all 18 tracks from the concert. It features interview footage with the band members, a behind the scenes look at how they prepare for their shows, and fan reactions from those in attendance. The CD version includes the same setlist of songs as found on the DVD but the recordings are straight from the stage so they have a different feel to them than the studio versions. Arch Allies Live at Riverport captures the raw excitement of their live shows and was very well received by fans and critics alike. It is still regarded as one of the best live albums ever recorded and is a permanent fixture in the collections of old and new fans of the band. It also serves as a perfect reminder of the legendary energy and experience of watching the Arch Allies perform live.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2284190}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hequ horse\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Hequ horse, previously called the Nanfan, is a horse breed native to the northwestern Tibetan plateau. Its ancestry traces to the Tang Dynasty, influenced by the Tibetan Pony, the Ferghana and the Mongolian horse. It was given its present name in 1954, from the Chinese word for its native region on the first loop of the Yellow River. Once common, the Hequ fell victim to Chinese policy and the mechanization of transportation.\n\nIt is divided into three types: the Jiaoke, the Suoke, and Kesheng. It has remarkable physiological adaptation, following strong pressure from natural selection, allowing them to live in hypoxic environments (in) the Tibetan plateau at altitudes of 4000 m. The Hequ shows great versatility, being present as at Tibetan local races for the religious use or herd management. The Chinese authorities are seeking to develop its livestock for meat. The breed remains common; thousands of these horses are still commonly found in areas of Maqu, Luqu and Xiahe.\n\nNomenclature\nThe breed was officially named \"Hequ\" in 1954 by the Northwest Livestock Office of China, but locally there are other names such as \"Tangke\", \"Qiaoke\" and \"Nanfan\".  Nafan was most often used in 1954. The name \"Hequ\" is a reference to the Chinese name of the first loop of the Yellow River, which forms the cradle of breed. Since 1954, only the official name is customary. In Russian, this horse is named \"Khetsyui\". It is often confused, wrongly, with the Tibetan pony.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Hequ is alternately described as a saddle horse and a light draft horse. It is a small horse measuring , weighing , with good conformation. The head is of medium length, with a straight profile. Fine, it features very mobile eyes. The ears are long, wide and well open nostrils. The muzzle is small, and the neck is medium to short, thick, sloping and well connected to shoulders, which are well-sloped. The chest is broad and deep, the back tends to be long, and the croup is slightly sloping. The hoof is wide, but not as strong as it should. The most common dresses are black, bay and gray dress being united principle.\n\nMares mature at two years old and are able to reproduce at three. They can give birth to 12 or 13 foals in their lives. The fertility rate is 70%, but can go up to 80 or even 90% with appropriate care.\n\nTypes\nThree varieties are distinguished in the breed: the Jiaoke (or Jiaode), the Suoke and Kesheng. The Jiaoke is from Southern Gansu, it is the heaviest variety. The head is broader and it sometimes has hoof soundness problems. The predominant color is gray. The Suoke comes from western Sichuan. The head is broad and coupling is short. They carry their tails high, similar to art from the Tang Dynasty. The Kesheng comesfrom the Kesheng Autonomous Region. It is further influenced by the Mongolian horse.\n\nTemperament and maintenance\n\nThe Hequ is particularly rustic. High at elevations ranging from 3000 to 5000 meters, it supports low temperatures, snowfall seven months of the year and rain during the summer. He quickly gains weight in summer, and loses its fat slower fall and winter than other horses. Its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions was the subject of an analysis published in PLOS ONE, concluding that it probably comes from a long evolution that favored the ability to handle low oxygen. This has made the Hequ suited to hypoxic environments (in). It thus has significant genetic and morphological differences from the horses lower altitudes. A study at the University of Gansu (published only in Chinese) reaches the same conclusion: the cold and low oxygen levels cause a visible physiological adaptation, particularly in terms of size, chest width and color skin.\n\nIn 2000, the composition of the pastures frequented the horses were analyzed, especially their mineral content and composition of blood Hequ. The results indicate that the levels of selenium and zinc are significantly inferior to the standard nutritional requirements of other breeds of horses.\n\nBreeding and genetics\nThe Hequ is considered one of the seven major Chinese groups of horses. They are considered by the Chinese to be a superior type of horse, including its size, higher than that of most of China's native horses. This breed is the subject of a selection in several breeding centers, to improve it.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Heredity has determined the breed to be a part of the Qinghai horse group of the Tibetan plateau, which is part Hequ with Chaidamu, Datong and Yushu. It has the lowest number of alleles (6.74) among the 28 breeds studied for the purposes of a comparison between Chinese horses, published in Animal Genetics. Six haplotypes were identified in horses Gansu. Cluster E is only present in the Hequ, which probably has the same origin as the Qilian mother horse. This study published in the Journal of Agricultural Biotechnology concluded (2014) that it is potentially a descendant of the Przewalski horse. Another study focused on the composition of testicular fibroblast Hequ standards (in 2012), showing that \"the horse is Hequ a major national genetic resource stored at the cellular level, which will provide an ideal experimental material for genetic studies.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hequ originates from the time of the Sping Period, by the state of Chin. It is most often used to mount war. The feudal king of Chin ordered the creation of a stud farm to breed cavalry mounts. Many horses are imported from West Asia and crossed with local animals. The Hequ is strongly influenced by the horse called \"Dawan,\" which seems to be the same as the Ferghana horse. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Hequ is crossed with the mounts of Mongol tribe Xianbei, which invade the current province of Qinghai. In the nineteenth century the Hequ is imported from southern Qinghai to the north of that province to be crossed with the Datong to improve it. From 1934, some Hequ crossed to give the Shandan race.\n\nDuring the census in 1980, the Hequ is one of the most common breeds of horses on the territory of China, with 180 000 head. However, the census FAO gives a different figure of around 60 000 head in 1982. In the early 1990s, Chinese researchers discuss measures to technically control the breeding of horses Hequ, so set a retention region and selecting a reference herd.\n\nThis breed is considered in decline since the late twentieth century. The major cause of this decline is related to the local Chinese policy, which instead encourages the breeding of sheep and yak. The other reason is to be found in the modernization of transport modes, young farmers and shepherds opting more often for a motorcycle or a moped to get around, to the detriment of the horse. In 2005, a quick survey of older Tibetans reveals they regret these changes, and fear that the horse will eventually disappear completely.\n\nUses\n\nThe Hequ is very versatile, its ability to cross the mountainous areas and wetlands is recognized. It is mainly used for light-draft work and mounted by Tibetan mountain shepherds, although the latter use is scarce. Sometimes it is saddled or harnessed for transportation and agricultural work. Its traction abilities are quite good, with a strong capacity for endurance. However, speed is moderate. They recover quickly after exercise.\n\nRacing and traditional uses\nThe Hequ remains associated with a religious and folk use to carry the reincarnated lama, or to participate in local horse racing. Maqu races are especially popular and attract hundreds of thousands of spectators came to see the riders compete in the region. These are endurance races, carried over distances ranging from 1 to 10 km. This horse is now valued in the context of tourism, the use of Hequ being considered deeply rooted in Tibetan culture. Some Tibetan herders have their horse as their \"best friend\".\n\nMeat production\nSeveral Chinese studies begun in 1989 and published in 1993 in the Journal of Gansu Agricultural University focused on the suitability of the breed for meat production. Among horses present in China, the Hequ is one of those with the best qualities for this purpose, the average percentage of recovered meat on the carcass being 79.42%. By its general appearance, Hequ has a conformation close to the desired kind on the market, including an elongated body, bones thin and has a layer of fat under the skin during the cold season. Chinese researchers believe necessary to select meat lines among this breed. The analysis of the composition of meat Hequ focused on its nutritional value, which is characterized by a high protein content (22.8%) and a very low fat (4.96%). The study adds that ethnic customs recede (and with them the traditional uses of this breed), and the breeding of horses for meat \"is not accepted by the masses.\"\n\nDissemination of livestock\nThe Hequ is considered by the study from the University of Uppsala (2010) as a local breed which is not endangered. According to the FAO assessment conducted in 2007, this horse is common.\n\nConsidered one of the native breeds of China and very famous in all countries, its breed cradle yet situated in a culturally Tibetan region, northwest of the Tibetan plateau, just near the first loop of the Yellow River at the crossroads of the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu. The population of Hequ has been eroded in the early twenty-first century, the number of horses being estimated to be in the range between 16 000 and 50 000 head. This horse is still found quite commonly in Maqu xian, who would conceal about 30 000 in 2012. It is also common in Xiahe xian and Luqu.\n\nReferences \n\nHorse breeds", "machine_text": " The Hequ horse is a breed of Chinese domestic horse originating from the Hequ region of Shaanxi province in northwestern China. It is a light, yet muscular breed, known for its intelligence and athleticism. The breed is primarily used for racing and polo in the region, but it is also gaining popularity as a show jumper or dressage horse. The Hequ is a relatively small horse standing between 14-16 hands, with a convex profile and a straight or slightly convex neck. Its head is small, with a broad forehead and large, bright eyes. Its back is strong and of medium length and its limbs are well-proportioned with large joints and thick hooves. The coat is typically bay, chestnut or gray, although there are also some roans and pinto color variations. The Hequ has a good temperament, alertness and a strong work ethic. The Hequ was developed in the Hequ region, which can trace its equine history to much earlier times. Horses were an essential part of everyday life in the area, and were used for transportation, herding, military purposes and even sport. The Hequ was bred to be able to stand up to the cold climate and rugged terrain of the region, and to be fast enough for racing, as well as being able to endure long days of work. Hequs are particularly popular for polo in the region and are also gaining recognition in show jumping and dressage events, where they have proved to be both agile and compliant. Despite their small size, they are strong and well-muscled, which is a great advantage when asked to perform complex movements at higher speeds. The Hequ is still relatively rare outside the region, but recent efforts have been made to promote the breed, and it is becoming increasingly popular for competitive sports. The ideal Hequ should exhibit boldness and agility, as well as an even temperament, and these qualities are being sought after as the breed grows in popularity.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52198749}

The population was 1,473 at the 2010 census. The village is southeast of Albany.\n\nAs of 2019, Castleton-On-Hudson was recognized as a Tree City USA from the Arbor Day Foundation.\n\nHistory \nCastleton gets its name from the exploration of the North (Hudson) River by Henry Hudson. While traveling up the river, he came upon a Mahican Indian village noted for a large structure located on a rise above the river. This structure was a storehouse for foodstuffs, but was of such size that it was thought to be a \"castle\".  Another theory for the derivation of the name \"Castleton\" comes from Rutherford Hayner's Troy and Rensselaer County New York: A History (1925). Hayner states \"Although the exact location of this landing of Hudson's has been more or less conjectural, the weight of opinion places it at or near the present site of the village of Castleton, for on Castle Hill, back of the village, stood the dwelling of the chief of the Mohicans.\"\n\nThe area of Castleton was settled in 1792. When the small village was incorporated into Rensselaer County on 13 April 1827, there were about 100 people living in the area, mostly along the banks of the river. Between 1890 and 1920, the village had a booming economy, with small industry, a hotel, and a small port to gain access to river traffic. However, a large flood destroyed much of the business district in 1936, and the industry took the opportunity to relocate. These days the town is a very residential suburb, with some light agriculture.\n\nThe name of the village was changed from Castleton to Castleton-on-Hudson in 1927.\n\nThe Gazetteer of the State of New York of 1860 reports that Castleton was formerly known as Morriches Hastie.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fiona Jones\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fiona Elizabeth Ann Jones (née Hamilton; 27 February 1957 – 28 January 2007) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. She was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark in Labour's landslide victory in the 1997 general election.\n\nJones was accused of fraudulently failing to declare the full amount of her election costs, convicted of election fraud in March 1999, and had the Labour whip withdrawn. She was the first MP to be disqualified from membership of the House of Commons for that offence since it was introduced by the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883.  However, the Court of Appeal overturned her conviction within weeks: the disqualification was revoked, and she resumed her place in the House of Commons. However, she lost her seat in the 2001 general election. She later lost a civil case brought against the police for malicious prosecution.\n\nEarly life\nJones was born in Liverpool and grew up in Fazakerley. An only child, her father, Fred Hamilton, was a production manager for a pharmaceutical company, and was a friend of Labour MP Eric Heffer. Heffer gave her a copy of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists when she was young, which inspired her to become an active socialist. She attended Wirral College of Art and Preston College, and joined the Labour Party at the age of 17.\n\nShe became a freelance journalist; her future husband, Christopher Jones, was also a journalist, who worked for the BBC. The couple moved to Lincolnshire. They were married in north Wales in 1982. They had two sons; Penri and Huw.\n\nPolitical career\nJones was elected as a Labour member of West Lindsey District Council, gaining Gainsborough South West ward from the Liberal Democrats in 1990. She served a single term and did not seek re-election in 1994. She was unsuccessful as the Labour Parliamentary candidate in the Conservative stronghold of Gainsborough and Horncastle in the 1992 general election, finishing in third place, and then failed to secure the nomination to fight for the marginal seat of Lincoln and the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Riverside.\n\nIn September 1995, she was selected to fight at Newark. Although she presented herself at the selection meetings as a traditional socialist, she was nevertheless a New Labour professional.  After her selection, she presented her New Labour sympathies, much to the consternation of a number of local party activists who had supported her nomination.\n\nShe was elected as Member of Parliament for Newark-on-Trent in the 1997 general election, ousting Conservative MP Richard Alexander, who had held the seat since the 1979 general election. She was pictured alongside 96 other women Labour MPs in the \"Blair babes\" photograph, and seen next to Tony Blair himself.\n\nHowever, the press labelled her the \"parliamentary virgin\", as she was the last of the 242 new MPs to make their maiden speech in the Commons. \"Having endured through gritted teeth being dubbed a 'Blair's babe', I am grateful at least to have the opportunity to relinquish for ever the title of being the last virgin in the House,\" she announced upon making the speech in January 1998. A Roman Catholic, Jones campaigned against abortion, and she appeared with Lord Longford at a Labour conference fringe meeting.\n\nAfter complaints by the Liberal Democrats, the police launched an investigation into her spending at the 1997 election campaign. Although submitting election expenses within the permitted maximum, she was charged with her agent Des Whicher with having fraudulently omitted to declare spending which would have taken her well over it. Although most of the charges collapsed and were withdrawn by the trial Judge, a dispute over whether the rent for a campaign office used also as party headquarters was left to the Jury. The two were convicted on 19 March 1999 of \"corrupt practices\", under section 82(6) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and she was sentenced to 100 hours' community service. Prominent members of the local Labour Party gave evidence against her, and much was made at the time of her rivals for the Labour Party candidacy.  At the selection meeting of the Newark Branch Labour Party, the local candidate came in a poor fourth, and withdrew from the contest at that stage. The runner up, Nick Palmer went on to win the Labour Party candidacy for the Broxtowe constituency. As a result of the conviction, Jones was disqualified from the House of Commons.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions on 15 April 1999.\n\nThe Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division held that the effect of the quashing of the conviction was that the disqualification was revoked with no need for a by-election, and she resumed her seat on 29 April.\n\nShe contested her seat in the 2001 general election, but lost to the Conservative candidate Patrick Mercer. In the 12 months before the 2001 general election, the local newspaper, The Newark Advertiser restricted reporting of her routine activities after she unsuccessfully demanded that every report concerning her should be submitted for her approval before publication; the newspaper lifted the restriction during the campaign.\n\nLater life\nAfter studying law at the University of Lincoln, Jones brought a civil case against Nottinghamshire Police for malicious prosecution.  The case was dismissed in December 2005, leaving her to bear costs of £45,000. In an interview, she claimed that a government minister had asked her for sex in return for assisting her to secure promotion.\n\nDeath\nJones reportedly became reliant on alcohol after she was shunned by her colleagues when she returned to the House of Commons in 1999 - only 34 signed an early day motion welcoming her back to the House of Commons after her conviction was quashed. Her husband said that she refused to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in case she was recognised.\n\nShe was found dead at her home in Saxilby by her husband, reportedly surrounded by 15 empty vodka bottles. Her cause of death was reported as alcoholism or alcoholic liver disease.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n The \"Fiona Jones archive\" in the Newark Advertiser.\n\n1957 births\n2007 deaths\nCouncillors in Lincolnshire\nEnglish Roman Catholics\nLabour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nPeople from West Lindsey District\nPoliticians from Liverpool\nFemale members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies\nUK MPs 1997–2001\n20th-century British women politicians\n21st-century British women politicians\nAlumni of the University of Lincoln\n20th-century English women\n20th-century English people\n21st-century English women\n21st-century English people\nWomen councillors in England", "machine_text": " Fiona Jones (born August 5, 1974) is a British singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer.

Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman was born in the year 2000 in the United States, to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to Brazil with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States. The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.\n\nBruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a divorce by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer João Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody. Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts. \nNew Jersey courts have denied visitation rights for both grandparents months before the grandfather's death.\n\nInternational ramifications\nThe case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level Brazilian and American officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit.

The child had been living in Butte County, California, with her family, and was forcibly taken against her will by the suspects who intended to ransom her for a substantial sum. The case began on August 11, 1995, when Anju Goldman disappeared while walking home from an ice cream shop in Oroville, California. Her body was eventually found in the Feather River near Oroville on October 8, 1995. Two men, 58-year-old Clarence Eugene \"Gene\" Evans and 59-year-old Paul Leslie Whiteacre, were arrested and charged with her abduction and murder. The trial began in November 1997 and Evans and Whiteacre were found guilty on all charges related to the abduction and murder. Evans was sentenced to life in prison without parole and Whiteacre was sentenced to life in prison with the potential for parole after 20 years. Mason Whiteacre, the brother of Paul Leslie Whiteacre, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the crime and served as a jail informant for authorities. The case drew national attention, due in part to the involvement of then-California Governor Pete Wilson, who called for a total of five million dollars from public and private organizations to fund the search for Anju. It also received media attention due to its grisly nature, as the suspects had planned to ransom the young girl before eventually killing her and disposing of her body in the Feather River. The case was seen as a wake up call to organizations, such as the Amber Alert, that are focused on finding missing children. It led to the introduction of tougher laws in California, making it easier to convict abductors and murderers of children. The Goldman case serves as an important reminder of the threats to children, and the need to remain vigilant in order to protect them.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25603498}

Her awards include a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nKakutani, a Japanese American, was born on January 9, 1955, in New Haven, Connecticut. She is the only child of Yale mathematician Shizuo Kakutani and his wife Keiko (\"Kay\") Uchida.  Her father was born in Japan, her mother was a second-generation Japanese-American who was raised in Berkeley, California. Michiko received her B.A. in English literature from Yale University in 1976, where she studied under author and Yale writing professor John Hersey, among others.\n\nCareer\nKakutani initially worked as a reporter for The Washington Post, and then from 1977 to 1979 for Time magazine, where Hersey had worked. In 1979, she joined The New York Times as a reporter.\n\nKakutani was a literary critic for The New York Times from 1983 until her retirement in 2017. Her occasionally harsh reviews of  prominent authors have garnered attention and sometimes criticism. For example, in 2006, Kakutani called Jonathan Franzen's The Discomfort Zone \"an odious self-portrait of the artist as a young jackass.\" Franzen subsequently called Kakutani \"the stupidest person in New York City\". In 2012, Kakutani wrote a negative review of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile. In 2018, Taleb stated in his book Skin in the Game that \"someone has to have read the book to notice that a reviewer is full of baloney, so in the absence of skin in the game, reviewers such as Michiko Kakutani\" can \"go on forever without anyone knowing\" that they are fabricating and drunk. According to Kira Cochrane in The Guardian, such counterattacks may have bolstered Kakutani's reputation as commendably \"fearless.\"\n\nShe has been known to write reviews in the voice of movie or book characters, including Brian Griffin, Austin Powers, Holden Caulfield, Elle Woods of Legally Blonde, and Truman Capote's character Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, The New York Times published a pre-release story written by Kakutani about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

In an article summing her book reviewing career, a writer in Vanity Fair called her \"the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world\" and credited her with boosting the careers of George Saunders, Mary Karr, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen, Ian McEwan, Martin Amis, and Zadie Smith.\n\nIn July 2018, Kakutani published a book criticizing the Trump administration titled The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.\n\nKakutani is a fan of the New York Yankees.

In \"Critical Condition\" (season 5, episode 6), Carrie Bradshaw releases a book that Kakutani reviews.

Robert Raikes the Elder started publishing the Gloucester Journal from the building on 9 April 1722. Robert Raikes, the Younger moved his printing business into the house in 1758 where he continued to publish the Gloucester Journal. In 1772, he moved into the house to live with his family. Robert Raikes was a promoter of the Sunday school movement, he held Sunday school sessions in the house's garden and Robert's wife used to serve plum cake to the children. After his death, it was again used as a merchant's house and shop. There were minor alterations made to the building throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1952, the building was grade II* listed. In 1973, the Dirty Duck restaurant opened on the site later becoming the Golden Cross public house in 1975.

The club lost Fowler and pitcher George Wilson to the white Adrian-based team Adrian Demons during the MSL season.\n\nIn 1896, Charlie Grant replaced Fowler at second. The Page Fence Giants beat the Cuban X-Giants in a 15-game series, 10 games to 5, to claim they were the top team in black baseball. The clinching game took place in Caro, Michigan, and regular shortstop Home Run Johnson was the winning pitcher that game. Overall they went 80-19 through August 1. In 1897, they went 125-12 with 82 consecutive wins. The 1898 tour was the club's last, as the next year many of the players went to the new Columbia Giants in Chicago.\n\nThe outcome of many games were disputed by the Giants' management, due to many games worked by unfair umpires assigned to the games. One published win-loss record was 1895, 121-31; 1896, 143-25; 1897, 129-10; 1898, 107-10.\n\nNotable players\n\nBud Fowler — (real name is John W. Jackson; born in Cooperstown, New York in 1858) 2B and manager, 1895; was a co-founder of the team, along with Home Run Johnson. Fowler left the team in July 1895 due to a dispute with the remaining team management, consisting of white businessmen, Len W. Hoch (former Adrian mayor and the city postmaster), Augustus \"Gus\" Parsons (Hotel Emery desk clerk), and brothers Rolla and Howard Taylor (co-owners of a hardware/sporting goods store) and all Adrian businessmen. J. Wallace Page, owner of the Page Woven Wire Fence Company, sponsored the team, but the factory did not claim any of the team's profits and only used the ball club as a marketing tool for their fence company.\n\nCharlie Grant — 2B, 1896-1898; nicknamed \"Cincy,\" as he hailed from Cincinnati, Ohio. Replaced Sol White as the Giants' second baseman.\n \nBilly Holland — Pitcher, OF, 1895–97; noted as a talented Tenor singer, who would belt out tunes during games. Respected as an excellent \"coacher\" or bench jockey during his career.\n\nChappie Johnson — LF, 1B, and Catcher, 1896–98; while playing on the same team as Home Run Johnson, Chappie was often referred to as \"Junior, as he was a younger than his teammate.\n\nWilliam Binga - 3B, C and OF, 1895-98; joined the Giants after spending time on a semi-professional team in Pontiac, Michigan earlier in 1895. \n\nGrant \"Home Run\" Johnson — SS and captain, 1895–98; played with the Findlay (Ohio) Sluggers with Bud Fowler in 1894 where he acquired the nickname for bashing 58 home runs that season. From Findlay, Ohio.\n\nJohn W. Patterson — 1895, 1896, 1897-98, 1B-3B; manages the team when it leaves Adrian and is sold to Chicago businessmen and becomes the Columbia Giants. Long-time city police officer in Battle Creek, Michigan after his playing career was completed. Died in Battle Creek after a fight with an escaped inmate. \n\nSol White — 2B, 1895; joined the Giants in June 1895, following the disbandment of his integrated Fort Wayne, Indiana, minor league team. Replaced the recently departed Bud Fowler at second base. Selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006 for his many years of contribution as a player, manager, executive, and black baseball reporter. His famous baseball book, published in 1907, has only a scant mention of his year on the Giants. \n\nGeorge Wilson — pitcher, 1895-1898; in 1895 split his time with the integrated Adrian Demons of the Michigan State League. Nicknamed the \"Palmyra Wonder\" after the town a few miles east of Adrian, where he was born and raised. Left-handed fireballer, who apparently pitched both overhand, but also could drop down with a submarine type delivery (\"upshoot\" pitch), Wilson was one of the top pitchers of this era. Was 29-4 with the Demons in 1895. Never married, he died in 1915 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was committed in their mental health asylum. Wilson is buried with his family members in Palmyra, Michigan. \n\nGeorge Taylor, 1895-1898, 1B\n\nSherman Barton, 1898, OF and pitcher\n\nPeter Burns, 1895-1898, catcher\n\n Augustus \"Gus\" Brooks, 1895, center field. Brooks died after collapsing in June 1895 during a game in Hastings, Michigan; and died few hours later in a local hotel. He was buried in Adrian's Oakwood Cemetery.\n\n Joe \"Cannon Ball\" Miller - right-handed pitcher and OF, 1895-1898; left the team in a dispute over allegations of betting on a game in which he was a pitcher. Was later re-signed by the Page Fence Giants.\n\n Fred Van Dyke - IF-OF-Pitcher; was on the team for several stints in 1895 and 1896.\n\n Vasco Graham - Catcher, 1895-1896; in 1895 played the bulk of the season with the integrated Adrian Demons of the Michigan State League (low level minors), as did pitcher George Wilson. \n\n James Chavous, right-handed pitcher, 1895-96; from Marysville, Ohio. \n\n Frank Waters, pitcher; a teen-aged substitute player and a native of Adrian, Michigan who was signed to short emergency stints in 1895 and 1896. \n\nWilliam Wendell Gaskin, 1895-96; regular team cook on their Monarch train car, appeared a couple of games as a substitute pitcher. Later was known for his award-winning penmanship. \n\nWilson, Fowler, Miller, Graham, Binga, and Burns also played games with the Adrian Demons in 1895, the town's entry into the Michigan State League, minor league. The Demons were the only integrated team in the league that season. Gus Parsons, Len Hoch, and the Taylor Brothers were the management group that operated the team in its only year of existence. Its most famous player was Honus Wagner, who played for a three-week period during July 1895 on the integrated Demons squad.\n\nFowler and Wilson left the team before the end of its first, 1895 season to play in the primarily white Michigan State League. (Riley 295, 873) Wilson posted a 29-4 record with the Adrian Demons that year and was the MSL's leading pitcher by all accounts.\n\nSources\n\nThe prose section is from the Baseball Reference Bullpen.

The team was organized in 1894 by Nelson Page, a former Adrian resident who owned a number store there. The team was composed largely of former semi-pro players from the area, and was named after the company Page owned, the Page Fence Company. Their games were held in a park near the corner of North Main and Broadway streets. It had a seating capacity of two thousand and was surrounded by white picket fence, earning the team its namesake. Professional teams from the eastern United States would travel to Adrian to face the Page Fence Giants, who were well-known for their style of play during the games. The team enjoyed success and was financially successful, every game selling out and every season profitable. The Giants also made regional and national tours, playing against teams like the New York Cuban Giants, the Chicago Unions and the Cuban X Giants. The team’s star players included pitcher William Binga, outfielder Robert \"Reggie\" Williams and catcher William \"Dizzy\" Dismukes. Binga played from 1894 to 1895, Williams from 1895 to 1898, and Dismukes from 1903 to 1905. The squad also featured Hoss Radbourne, a pitcher who would go on to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Giants' success led to a scandal in which the team was accused of being involved in a betting scandal and receiving payment from gamblers to throw the Championship Game in 1902. This ended the team's stay in Adrian. After the Giants disbanded in 1905, the Page Fence Company reorganized and became the Page Fence Company Athletic Club, which played amateur baseball and other sports until 1920. Today, The Adrian Historical Society recognizes the Page Fence Giants as a pivotal part of Michigan's baseball history. Teams like the Page Fence Giants paved the way for black Major League talent and formed the foundation of the \"Negro Leagues\". One of their original players, William Dismukes, is included in the Michigan Baseball Hall of Fame. The legacy of the Page Fence Giants continues to inspire current players and draw attention to a unique time in Adrian, Michigan's history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7264542}

Kostenurka Island has a total area of approximately 10 square kilometers and lies approximately 25 kilometers from the city of Oulu. The island is known for its abundant fish population, and the lake is a very popular destination for anglers. The lake contains many different species of fish, ranging from Trout, Arctic Char, Whitefish and Perch, which can be easily caught by an angler. The island can be accessed by boat, using a boat launch located in Siikajoki. The island has no permanent inhabitants and as a result, it is incredibly quiet and peaceful. There are two huts, one located on the northwest side and one on the northeast side of the island. These huts provide shelter for those who choose to use them. The island has a unique landscape, with the highest point being approximately 12 meters above sea level. The surrounding lake is shallow and fluctuates between depths of 1.5 meters around the edges to 1.8 meters in the center. There are several small islands within Kostenurka which are highly popular amongst wildlife watchers, photographers, and bird watchers. Kostenurka Island is a popular fishing spot, as well as a great place for people to enjoy nature and find peace and relaxation. It is an ideal spot for campers and people looking for a peaceful break away from the hustle and bustle of life. It offers a special place to relax and observe nature in its true glory. The island can be enjoyed in all seasons, although autumn has to be the most breath taking time to visit the island.

The year 1814 was a tumultuous and consequential year in European history. It marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which began in 1799, and the start of the Congress of Vienna, which led Europe into a century of relative peace. In the beginning of the year, Napoleon Bonaparte had forced the first abdication of his title as the Emperor of France. England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and formed the Coalition forces to invade France. Europe was forced further into chaos by multiple wars and invasions, until Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in April. This led to the restoration of French monarchy, the return of the Bourbon dynasty, and the creation of the Bourbon Restoration. In July of 1814, the Congress of Vienna was convened. This conference marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the start of one of the longest periods of peace Europe had seen since the fall of the Roman Empire. The Congress resulted in the redrawing of boundaries and the creation of new states, as well as the establishment of the German Confederation, which had a shared political and economic federal government. In August of 1814, Louis XVIII of France was crowned king of France and Navarre. October 31 of the same year marked the formation of the Allied Kingdom of the Netherlands from the Austrian Netherlands, the former Dutch Republic, which had become a French puppet state earlier in the century. The year 1814 saw new inventions, discoveries, and inventions being made. The steam locomotive and bicycle were both developed in 1814, as were irrigation methods and high-pressure industrial machines. In Germany, the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer published his book The World as Will and Representation, a seminal work in the field of philosophy. The year 1814 also saw the completion of many great works of art. Artist Francisco de Goya completed his series of etchings and prints, The Disasters of War, depicting the horrors of the Peninsular War in Spain. At the same time, Ludwig van Beethoven composed his Ninth Symphony and his Violin Concerto in D Major, adding two of his most enduring works to the musical canon. 1814 marked the end of a tumultuous period in European history, and from it sprung a period of relative peace and prosperity. New advances and developments in technology, science, and culture opened the doors to a new era of international cooperation and understanding.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34948}

The Javelinas were led by second year head coach Homer Bryce and played their home games at Javelina Stadium in Kingsville, Texas. They finished the season with a 9–1–0 record and were ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll and No. 1 in the UPI Poll. Their only loss was in the Grantland Rice Bowl against the Florida A&M Rattlers, who were led by a first-year head coach Joe Gilliam Sr. The 1969 season was a successful year for the Javelinas; notable highlights include a 28–3 win over rival Southwest Texas State and a 31–16 win over No. 16 Arkansas State. The Javelinas' defense was one of the best in the nation; they held eight opponents to 10 points or less, and five opponents to zero points. Defensive back Dennis Court was named an All-American in 1969. Offensively, the Javelinas had an explosive offense, led by quarterback Bobby Marrow who threw for 1,121 yards and 16 touchdowns. In addition to their success on the field, the 1969 Javelinas made history with their all-black starting lineup. This was the first time in Texas collegiate history that an all-black team had started in a college game, making the 1969 Javelinas the first African American college football team in Texas.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"José Locsín\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "José Certeza Locsín (August 27, 1891 – May 1, 1977) was a Philippine doctor and senator.\n\nEarly life and education\nDr. José Corteza Locsín was born on August 27, 1891 in Silay, Negros Occidental. He was the third child among the five siblings of Domingo Locsín and Enriqueta Corteza. His family, who was originally from Molo, Iloilo, was among the most prominent when they settled in Silay. They acquired lands and engaged in sugarcane farming. They were devout Roman Catholics.\n\nLocsín finished his primary education in Silay. Thereafter, his parents sent him to Manila to study, first at Liceo de Manila and afterwards at the Universidad de Santo Tomas, where he graduated with the degree of Doctor of Medicine, receiving the honor “Meritissimus.”\n\nMedical practice \nHe started his medical profession in Silay, where he established the Maternity and Children’s Hospital which later became the Silay General Hospital. He was also responsible for the establishment of a Rest and Resettlement Center for Tuberculosis in Patag, Silay’s mountain barangay. He also organized several women's clubs to run puericulture centers. Apart from his initiatives in Silay, he was also responsible for the establishment of the Negros Occidental Provincial Hospital and later its School of Nursing.\n\nPolitical career \nAlthough Dr. Locsín was a doctor by profession, he inclined politics. Due to his service to the people of Silay, he was elected as Municipal Councilor when he first decided to run for public office. After that, he was elected as provincial member of Negros Occidental. In 1925, he became Governor of Negros Occidental. In his three years as governor, he focused on building roads and bridges throughout the province further establishing a waterworks system. Along with the Provincial Board, he initiated the development of the provincial government building. He also placed a high priority on improving the province’s educational system and for having had more schools built during his term than all the governors before him combined.\n\nAfter his term as governor, he ran for Congress and was elected representative of the first district of Negros Occidental in 1928. As a representative of a district whose primary means of livelihood depend upon the sugar industry, he worked for the modernization of sugar centrals, increasing the share of sugarcane planters within the sugar produced, and raising the wages of farm laborers. As Chairman of the Committee on Public Instruction, he worked on the establishment of faculties in remote barrios and well plazas in towns to market cultural events.\n\nIn 1935, he became a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. One of his outstanding contributions as a delegate to the convention was the inclusion of social justice within the Constitution’s declaration of principles. Dr. Locsín was a member of the Nacionalista Party, and a fanatical advocate of its principles, and a loyal supporter of its members. When Ferdinand Marcos switched allegiance and ran for president in 1965 under Nationalista, he supported Marcos’ candidacy, being members of the said party. But when Marcos declared martial law in 1972, he was disheartened and regretted having given his support to Marcos’ presidency. Although he was no longer active in politics during the time of Martial Law, Dr. Locsín wore a black ribbon as a sign of protest against Marcos. Even on his deathbed, he wore with him the black ribbon symbolizing his mourning of the death of democracy.\n\nAt the Senate \nDr. Locsín was the first post-war cabinet member under President Sergio Osmena in 1945 to 1946, serving as Secretary of the Department of Health and Public Welfare to help people recuperate from the ravages of World War II. From 1951 to 1957, he served the country as a senator and dedicated himself to addressing a wide range of issues. As Chairman of the Health Committee, he worked for the approval of various measures to ensure and promote the health and safety of people through the establishment of Rural Health Units, the standardization of hospital services, and the National Campaign Against Tuberculosis. In addition, he also secured appropriations for the construction of new hospitals, health centers, clinics and other health care facilities. At the same time, he also worked for the improvement of salary levels of public health care personnel, especially doctors. As Chairman of the Committee on Accounts, he strived to maintain the annual appropriation in order to prevent any deficiency during his term. His other achievements as a Senator include sponsorship of the Rural Banks Act; authorship of the Flag Ceremony Law which gave importance to recognizing and respecting the Philippine flag; increase of the salary of public school teachers; and passage of a measure to celebrate the centennial of the birth of Dr. Jose Rizal in an appropriate manner. Senator Locsín was a member of the Philippine economic mission headed by Senator Laurel which worked for the Laurel-Langley Trade Agreement of 1945.\n\nThe Filipino First Policy \nPerhaps the greatest contribution of Dr. Locsín to the upliftment of the Filipino people is his authorship of the bill popularly known as the “Filipino First Policy” during his term as Chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC, now the National Economic and Development Authority, or NEDA) from 1958 to 1961. As an effect of the Filipino First Policy, agro-industrial development was given impetus and encouragement. This resulted in the establishment of more cement factories, flour mills, and FILOIL–the first of the Filipino-owned gasoline companies. It also led to the banning of importation of plywood, the financing of irrigation and fertilizer programs, and the construction of artesian wells and hydro-electric power plants in different parts of the Philippines. Another major result was the development of new industries through the Industrial Dispersal Program, and the program for social and economic development of the Mindanao Region.\n\nAt the same time that he was Chairman of NEC, he headed the National Productivity Board of the Philippines. As such, he contributed to the establishment of the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) of which he was unanimously elected its first Chairman in May 1961 during its inaugural meeting in Tokyo, Japan, an honour not only to himself but to the Philippines which he represented. When his term as NEC Chairman ended in 1961, he was appointed as Acting Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. During this short assignment, he had the licensing of forest concessions investigated which led to a marked reduction in the granting of such licenses and the filing of legal cases against illegal logging in the country.\n\nLegacy \nIn 1974, Dr. Locsín suffered a stroke which some people say was brought about by his frustration with not being able to directly do anything about abolishing Martial Law. From then on, he underwent several surgical procedures due to problems with his gallbladder and prostate. Because of complications brought about by old age and his illnesses, he became bedridden in 1976. On May 1, 1977, he died at the age of 88. He left a legacy of dedicated and principled public service. Before his death, it was proposed that the city of Silay be renamed after him, but he refused. After his death, the hospital in Silay was renamed after him in honor and gratitude for his service to the Silaynons. The Rizal Cultural and Civic Center in his hometown, Silay was also built in his honor and named after him. However, in spite of these recognitions, many of the younger Silaynons do not know who he really was and what he had accomplished. Recently, the Dr. Jose C. Locsín Memorial Provincial Hospital, which he had established, was closed down and all its services were transferred to the new Teresita L. Jalandoni Provincial Hospital.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married Salvacion Montelibano and had eighteen children. One of his sons died of typhoid at the age of four. He experienced another loss in 1959 when his wife died of cardiac arrest at the age of 61. In 1962, at the age of 70, he remarried. His second wife, Delia Ediltrudes Santiago, a social worker from Bacolod, bore him a son and a daughter.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Senate site\n\nSenators of the 3rd Congress of the Philippines\nSenators of the 2nd Congress of the Philippines\nSecretaries of Agriculture of the Philippines\nSecretaries of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines\nSecretaries of Health of the Philippines\nSecretaries of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines\nPeople from Silay\nGovernors of Negros Occidental\nNacionalista Party politicians\n20th-century Filipino medical doctors\n1891 births\n1977 deaths\nOsmeña Administration cabinet members\nGarcia Administration cabinet members\nMacapagal Administration cabinet members\nUniversity of Santo Tomas alumni\nMembers of the Philippine Legislature\nMembers of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Negros Occidental\nVisayan people", "machine_text": " José Locsín (born January 5, 1990) is a professional basketball player from Philippines.

During his college career, Locsín earned the nickname \"Tazmanian Devil\" for his relentless defense and offensive ability. Locsín was selected by the Air21 Express as the 11th pick in the 2009 PBA draft. In his rookie season, he averaged 8.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.1 steals and 37% three-point field goal percentage. After playing an important role with the Air21 in the 2009 PBA Fiesta Conference Finals, Locsín improved his stats and was selected to the 2010 PBA All-Rookie Team. After averaging career highs of 12.6 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.2 steals in the 2011 PBA season, he was traded to the Alaska Aces. During the 2011–12 PBA season, he made an impact and was part of the Aces' championship run. He would continue to perform well for the Aces and was eventually selected to the 2013 PBA All-Star team. In the 2013–14 PBA season, the Aces made it to the All Filipino Cup finals. Locsín played a major role for the Aces averaging 14.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 steals and a remarkable 48% three point field goal percentage. It was the best performance of his PBA career. He is currently one of the more experienced players on the team and is a vital part of the Aces' rotation. In his five years in the PBA, Locsín has made a name for himself as a talented player with great skills and a willingness to work hard. He is one of the premier shooting guards in the league and is among the best at his position. He has improved in each season and is still considered a premier talent in the PBA today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15759655}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Otto Strasser\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Otto Johann Maximilian Strasser (also , see ß; 10 September 1897 – 27 August 1974) was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party. Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant Hitlerite faction. He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler. This group also functioned during his exile and World War II as a secret opposition group.\n\nHis brand of Nazism is now known as Strasserism.\n\nCareer \n\nBorn at Bad Windsheim in the Kingdom of Bavaria, Otto Strasser took an active part in World War I (1914-1918). On 2 August 1914 he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded. He returned to Germany in 1919, where he served in the Freikorps that in May 1919 put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which was organized on the principles of workers' councils. About this time he joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1920 he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch, but he grew increasingly alienated with his party's reformist stance, particularly when it put down a workers' uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year. In 1925 he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), in which his brother Gregor had been a member for several years, and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He focused particularly on the socialist elements of the  party's program and led the party's left faction in northern Germany together with his brother and Joseph Goebbels. His faction advocated support for  strikes, nationalization of banks and industry, and – despite acknowledged differences – closer ties with the Soviet Union. Hitler opposed some of these policies, judging them too radical and too alienating from parts of the German people (middle class and Nazi-supporting nationalist industrialists in particular), and the Strasser faction suffered defeat at the Bamberg Conference (1926), with Joseph Goebbels joining Hitler. Humiliated, Otto Strasser nonetheless, along with Gregor, continued as a leading Left Nazi within the party until Hitler expelled him from the NSDAP in 1930.\n\nAfter expulsion\nFollowing his expulsion, he set up his own party, the Black Front, composed of like-minded former NSDAP members, in an attempt to split the Nazi Party. His party proved unable to counter Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and Strasser spent the years of the Nazi era in exile. The Nazi Left itself was annihilated during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 – in which his brother Gregor Strasser was killed – leaving Hitler as undisputed party leader and able to pacify both industrialists and the military into accepting his new Nazi regime. In addition to the Black Front, Strasser at this time headed the  Free German Movement outside Germany; this group (founded in 1941) sought to enlist the aid of Germans throughout the world in bringing about the downfall of Hitler and his vision of Nazism.\n\nExile\nStrasser fled first to Austria, then to Czechoslovakia (Prague), Switzerland, and France. In 1940 he went to Bermuda by way of Portugal, leaving a wife and two children behind in Switzerland. In 1941 he emigrated to Canada, where he became the famed \"Prisoner of Ottawa\". During this time, Goebbels denounced Strasser as the Nazis' \"Public Enemy Number One\" and a price of $500,000 was set on his head. He settled for a time in Montreal. In 1942, he lived for a time in  Clarence, Nova Scotia, on a farm owned by a German-speaking Czech, Adolph Schmidt, then moved to nearby  Paradise, where he lived for more than a decade in a rented apartment above a general store. As an influential and uncondemned former Nazi Party member still faithful to many doctrines of Nazism, he was initially prevented from returning to West Germany after the war, first by the  Allied powers and then by the  West German government.\n\nDuring his exile, he wrote articles on Nazi Germany and its leadership for several British, American, and Canadian newspapers, including the New Statesman, and a series for the Montreal Gazette, which was ghostwritten by then-Gazette reporter and later politician Donald C. MacDonald.\n\nReturn to Germany and death\nIn 1950 East Germany invited Strasser to become a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, but he declined, hoping that he would be permitted to return to Bavaria, which had been under US occupation until 1949. In his view, West Germany constituted an American colony and East Germany a Russian colony. He eventually gained West German citizenship and settled in Munich.\n\nHe attempted to create a new \"nationalist and socialist\"-oriented party in 1956, the German Social Union (often called a successor to the 1949–1952, eventually forbidden Socialist Reich Party of Germany), but his organization was unable to attract any support. For the rest of his life, Strasser continued to advocate for  Strasserite Neo-Nazism until he died in Munich in 1974.\n\nOtto Strasser claimed he was a dissenting Nazi regarding racial policies. Throughout his life, he claimed to have actively opposed such policies within the Nazi movement, for example, by organizing the removal of Julius Streicher from the German Völkisch Freedom Party.\n\nWritten works\n Hitler and I (translated by Eric Mosbacher and Gwenda David) [Hitler und Ich.

He was a strong advocate for the \"socialist\" wing of the National Socialist Workers' Party (NSDAP) opposed to the more \"capitalist\" wing of the party that eventually came to dominate it. Strasser was a leading left-wing figure in Nazi Germany who broke with Adolf Hitler in 1930. Strasser and his advocate for a \"Second Revolution\" to replace Hitler’s \"First Revolution\" of 1933, which he deemed inadequate in its progress towards a true National Socialist revolution embarked on to truly empower the German working class. Strasser was born in Geisenfeld, Bavaria to a middle-class Catholic family. His mother had royal Prussian ancestry but his father was a socialist journalist who encouraged his son's interest in politics and far-left ideas. Strasser attended law school at the University of Munich in 1917 and joined the German army at the start of World War I, receiving three Iron Cross medals and the rank of second lieutenant. After the war he joined the Bavarian Freikorps and fought for the White Army against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. Strasser's first political activity after the war was as a member of the German Socialist Party (DSP). He worked to expand the party's support among the \"working youth\" of Bavaria and eventually became the party's leader. He also became a member of the Nazi Party in its early days and made significant efforts to push the party towards its far-left socialist roots. He felt that the Nazi Party should be more oriented towards the working class and less towards big business and capitalism. This disparity between his views and those of Hitler led to a major split between the two, with Strasser leaving the party in 1930. Strasser wrote several works including The Revolution of Nihilism in 1929 and Marxism or National Socialism? in 1932. He formed the Black Front, a party of the extreme political left, after leaving the Nazi Party, and became its leader. The group remained small, however, and in 1933 it was officially shut down by the Gestapo due to Strasser's anti-Hitler stance. After World War II, Strasser emigrated to Canada and helped found the Canadian League for Social Reconstruction. He eventually settled in Zurich, Switzerland, where he wrote works such as his autobiography, My Opposition, and continued to oppose Hitler and National Socialism until his death in 1974. In recent years, Strasser's ideas have had renewed relevance as his struggles against capitalism and his search for a true people’s revolution have attracted an increasing number of admirers. His ideas have also resonated with contemporary socialists who share Strasser’s view of National Socialism as a tool to emancipate the working class. Strasser's memory and ideas remain an important part of Germany's historical and political landscapes, and he continues to be viewed as a powerful advocate for a truly revolutionary and socialist economy in a nation traditionally dominated by private industry.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 579634}

It was composed during the spring of 1933 at a passionate and tumultuous period in Szymanowski’s life, and was a critical work in the development of the composer’s final style. The first performance of the symphony occurred in February 1935, when it was played by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer’s pupil, Grzegorz Fitelberg. In its premiere concert, the work was coupled with Szymanowski’s 1st and 3rd Symphonies. The formal structure of the symphony is in four movements. It begins with an Allegro initial movement that serves as an abiding entity throughout. An episode takes up the middle section, and the whole is concluded with a brilliant, energetic recapitulation of the opening materials. The second movement is a dramatic scherzo and trio based on an idyllic, pastoral melody. It is marked by swiftness of tempo and fleeting, modulatory ambiences, and features habanera- and polonaise-style rhythms that introduce a sonic awareness of Szymanowski’s native Poland. The third movement is a somber “Largo”, in which a cast of woodwind instruments assume dominant roles. The music here is slow and contemplative, with a broad, static wall of sound. It is built around longer melodic lines and slowly developing imitative contrapuntal strands that give the music a dreamy, reflective nature. The fourth and final movement is a brilliant “Finale” of sparkling, brilliant sonorities and larger-than-life dynamics and textures. It presents a panoramic view of the orchestra in its full power, to the backdrop of a cyclic theme and a tumultuous string of bravura cadences in the closing moments of the symphony. Symphony No. 4 is emblematic of Szymanowski’s late, mature compositional style, with its eclectic use of Polish folklore, impressionist harmonies, and exotic sonorities. The work was a success upon its premiere, and since then it has gone on to become a popular piece in the orchestral repertoire. It has had several recordings, released on various record labels, and since 2004 it has been featured in a number of festivals commemorating the composer’s 125th anniversary.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60495750}

First formed in August 1916, the unit was based in various airfields in northern France and tangled with Allied opposite numbers in support of German operations on the Western Front battlefields. The squadron was formed as Kampfstaffel 28 (Kasta 28) on August 1, 1916, in Stendel. The squadron was re-designated as Jaegerstaffel 28 (Jasta 28) during December 1916, and was based at various airfields in northern France for the duration of the First World War. The unit was first led by First Lieutenant Karl Döring from 1916-July 1917, but he was forced to leave due to a medical condition. The new commanding officer was Hauptmann Hermann Göring, from July 1917-October 1917. Jasta 28's first kill was on 6 September 1916, when two of its pilots, Felix Völker and Walter Höffner, shot down a French Nieuport 11. The Jasta scored consistently throughout the war, downing a total of 92 confirmed enemies and a further five unconfirmed. The unit featured well-respected pilots such as Ernst Udet, Josef Jacobs, Hans-Joachim Buddecke, Ernst Freiherr von Althaus, and Werner Voss. Pilot Ernst Udet scored the most kills with a total of 62, the highest of the entire Luftstreitkräfte. Josef Jacobs was the highest scoring ace and leader of the unit during the winter of 1917-1918, shooting down 11 French and British wartime aircraft before his death on 1 March 1918 while under attack by seven British aircraft. Jasta 28 was also the first unit to equip its aircraft with the Parabellum MG14 machine gun, as well as the first to use Fokker D.VII fighters in July 1918. By the end of the war, Jasta 28 had a total of 92 enemy aircraft destroyed and 5 unconfirmed, 24 of which were shot down prior to the introduction of the Fokker D.VII. Overall, Jaguarstaffel 28 was one of the most successful German fighter squadrons during the First World War. Comprised of several young, experienced and decorated pilots, the Jagdstaffel 28 was able to achieve significant successes on the battlefield and become a significant contributor in Germany's air war.

He also served as the area's first postmaster. In 1879, the town was named after Bickle. The town's economy was initially based largely on cattle ranching and wheat farming. A series of fires in 1937 and 1947 destroyed many of the town's original buildings.\n\nThe oldest surviving building in Bickleton is the Bluebird Inn, a tavern which first opened in 1882. It is billed as the oldest functioning tavern in the state, although it has changed ownership numerous times and operated under different names throughout its history. The tavern includes a 1903 Brunswick pool table, which is still used by regulars.\n\nThe town has held an annual picnic and rodeo continuously since 1910.

It became a local fad, and now there are thousands of birdhouses purposely built to house bluebirds.\n\nBoth the mountain bluebird and the western bluebird nest in Bickleton. Maintaining the houses by cleaning old nests is a major task for the local residents. It is funded by profits from bluebird souvenirs sold to tourists at Whitmore's Whoop-n-Holler Ranch Museum.\n\nGeography\nBickleton is in northeastern Klickitat County, south of the Horse Heaven Hills and the Yakama Indian Reservation.

It is situated in the valley just south of the Blue Mountains, located in a section of the state known as The Palouse. The town lies on Washington State Route 22, approximately 30 miles south of Goldendale and 40 miles northwest of Pendleton. The town of Bickleton was first settled in 1887 along the White Salmon River. It is named for its founder, local rancher and prospector George W. Bickleton, who claimed the land at the base of the Blue Mountains. The surrounding terrain is quite rugged, with nearby mountains and rugged canyons. The early settlers at Bickleton were miners and ranchers, and the town began to prosper due to its location along the White Salmon River. The River was well-known as a place to catch large salmon, and local settlers also harvested crops such as corn, wheat, oats, and potatoes. Bickleton was also a stop along the stagecoach route between Spokane, Washington and Goldendale, Washington. Today, Bickleton has a population of approximately 200 people. There are several businesses in the town, including a café, a gas station, and an RV park. Bickleton is a popular destination for campers, hikers, and nature lovers who come to explore the nearby mountains and trails.

It is one of the oldest continually-running rodeos in the country, and features bull and bronc riding, calf roping, and mutton bustin’ competitions. Nearby Bickleton is the first building erected in the area, known as the J.C. Bridges House. The house was built in 1899 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is listed as one of the oldest standing buildings in Eastern Washington. Bickleton is a great place to get away from it all and explore the nearby mountains and natural beauty.

His biggest hits were \"Hey, Girl\", a top ten US pop hit in 1963, and \"Are You Lonely for Me\", a no. 1 hit on the R&B chart in early 1967.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, and sang in his grandmother's gospel group, Sally Jones & the Gospel Keyes, touring England with at the age of 12. He studied medicine at the University of Rhode Island and then at Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, but began singing again with the Swanee Quintet Juniors and gave up his medical career.\n\nIn 1956, he recorded as a secular singer with the J&S label in New York City, releasing his first solo single \"Running Home\". He also wrote the top 10 R&B hit \"I'll Be Spinning\" for the label's duo Johnnie & Joe, and his song \"Baby I'm Sorry\" was recorded by Ricky Nelson for his 1957 debut album Ricky. He was conscripted for the Korean War, but continued to record for small labels with little success. After leaving the military, he turned to songwriting, joining the Aldon Music publishing company set up by Al Nevins and Don Kirshner in the Brill Building, where he recorded many of his own demos and worked as a record producer with Erma Franklin. He also continued to release his own records, including \"Baby, You're a Long Time Dead\" for Joy Records (New York) in 1961.\n\nIn 1962, he worked with fellow songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King on their song \"Hey, Girl\", recording a demo for singer Chuck Jackson. When Jackson failed to come to a recording session, Scott recorded the song, and, when eventually released by the Colpix label some months later, it rose to no. 10 on both the pop and R&B charts. He followed it with a slow version of Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\", which again made the charts. When Colpix collapsed, he moved to Columbia, which tried to market him, with little success. He left Columbia Records in 1965, and moved to the Shout label, a subsidiary of Bert Berns' Bang Records. There, he recorded Berns' song \"Are You Lonely for Me\", reputedly requiring over 100 takes before it was finished. The record stayed at the top of the R&B charts for four weeks and reached no. 39 on the pop chart.\n\nHe followed up with a version of \"Cry to Me\", another Berns song that had previously been a hit for Solomon Burke  and Betty Harris. Although he continued to have success with R&B chart hits, including \"(You) Got What I Need\", written and produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and a version of Van Morrison's \"He Ain't Give You None\", his career was affected by Berns' sudden death at the end of 1967. Scott continued to perform, but spent much of the next two years without a record deal. He eventually signed with the small Elephant V label, before moving on to Probe Records, where he had his last R&B hit in 1970 with a version of Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released.\" He continued to work with his songwriting partner Helen Miller, wrote advertising jingles, and took minor roles as an actor in films, including Stiletto. He also recorded in the early 1970s for the Vanguard, Pickwick International and Mainstream labels, and continued to perform concerts.\n\nScott later worked on the oldies circuit, and released a new album, Brand New Man, in 2001. He also performed \"Brown Eyed Girl\" on the Van Morrison tribute album Vanthology, released in 2003. He died in New York City in 2007 at the age of 74.\n\nHis 1968 song \"(You) Got What I Need\" was sampled for the 1989 Biz Markie hit \"Just a Friend\".

Much of his best-known work was produced by the songwriting team of Lieber & Stoller. Scott was born in Providence, Rhode Island and raised in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. He first started singing at the Greater Nazerene Baptist Church in Harlem and, in the 1950s, he joined a gospel group called the Consolators. After a family member spotted him playing the guitar and singing on a street corner, he auditioned for record producer Jack Richmond. Richmond signed Scott to a record deal with Columbia Records. Scott's first single, \"I Don't Want to Cry\", peaked at number 13 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1961. That same year, Scott released two other singles, \"Without a Word of Warning\" and \"Lonely Man\". While the singles failed to chart, they gained Scott some notoriety in the music industry and earned him an appearance on American Bandstand. Scott's first big break came in 1962 when he released \"Cry to Me\". The single was written and produced by Lieber & Stoller and reached number eight on the R&B chart. Following the success of \"Cry to Me\", Scott released the hit single, \"Hey, Girl\", which reached number five on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts. \"Hey, Girl\" secured Scott a recording contract with Shout Records. Throughout the remainder of the 1960s, Scott released several more sides with Lieber & Stoller. Some of his biggest hits included \"Hey, Little Schoolgirl\", \"You Got What I Need\", \"I Don't Know What I'm Doing\" and \"Are You Lonely for Me Baby\". After this string of hits, Scott moved to London, where he continued to record for a variety of labels, including MGM and Sue Records. In the 1970s, Scott began to focus primarily on gospel music. He released three albums during this time: Walkin' In The Light (1971), For You I Sing (1973) and Prime Time (1975). He also re-recorded some of his greatest hits with a gospel flavor. In 2007, Scott died of congestive heart failure at the Miriam Hospital in Providence at the age of 74.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Anne Bradstreet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Anne Bradstreet (née Dudley; March 20, 1612 – September 16, 1672) was the most prominent of early English poets of North America and first writer in England's North American colonies to be published. She is the first Puritan figure in American Literature and notable for her large corpus of poetry, as well as personal writings published posthumously. \n\nBorn to a wealthy Puritan family in Northampton, England, Bradstreet was a well-read scholar especially affected by the works of Du Bartas. She was married at sixteen, and her parents and young family migrated at the time of the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.  A mother of eight children and the wife and daughter of public officials in New England, Bradstreet wrote poetry in addition to her other duties. Her early works read in the style of Du Bartas, but her later writings develop into her unique style of poetry which centers on her role as a mother, her struggles with the sufferings of life, and her Puritan faith.  Her first collection, The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, was widely read in America and England.\n\nBackground \nIn a portrait that was painted by her later poems, Bradstreet is described as 'an educated English woman, a kind, loving wife, devoted mother, Empress Consort of Massachusetts, a questing Puritan and a sensitive poet.'\n\nBradstreet's first volume of poetry was The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, published in 1650. It was met with a positive reception in both the Old World and the New World.\n\nLife\nAnne was born in Northampton, England, 1612, the daughter of Thomas Dudley, a steward of the Earl of Lincoln, and Dorothy Yorke. Due to her family's position, she grew up in cultured circumstances and was a well-educated woman for her time, being tutored in history, several languages, and literature. At the age of sixteen she married Simon Bradstreet. Both Anne's father and husband were later to serve as governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Anne and Simon, along with Anne's parents, emigrated to America aboard the Arbella as part of the Winthrop Fleet of Puritan emigrants in 1630. She first stood on American soil on June 14, 1630, at what is now Pioneer Village (Salem, Massachusetts) with Simon, her parents, and other voyagers as part of the Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640). Due to the illness and starvation of Gov. John Endecott and other residents of the village, their stay was very brief. Most moved immediately south along the coast to Charlestown, Massachusetts, for another short stay before moving south along the Charles River to found \"the City on the Hill,\" Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Bradstreet family soon moved again, this time to what is now Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1632, Anne had her first child, Samuel, in Newe Towne, as it was then called. Despite poor health, she had eight children and achieved a comfortable social standing. Having previously been afflicted with smallpox as a teenager in England, Anne would once again fall prey to illness as paralysis overtook her joints in later years. In the early 1640s, Simon once again pressed his wife, pregnant with her sixth child, to move for the sixth time, from Ipswich, Massachusetts, to Andover Parish. North Andover is that original town founded in 1646 by the Stevens, Osgood, Johnson, Farnum, Barker, and Bradstreet families, among others. Anne and her family resided in the Old Center of North Andover, Massachusetts. They never lived in what is now known as \"Andover\" to the south.\n\nBoth Anne's father and her husband were instrumental in the founding of Harvard University in 1636. Two of her sons were graduates, Samuel (Class of 1653) and Simon (Class of 1660). In October 1997, the Harvard community dedicated a gate in memory of her as America's first published poet (see last paragraph below). The Bradstreet Gate is located next to Canaday Hall, the newest dormitory in Harvard Yard.\n\nIn 1650, Rev. John Woodbridge had The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America composed by \"A Gentlewoman from Those Parts\" published in London, making Anne the first female poet ever published in both England and the New World. On July 10, 1666, their North Andover family home burned (see \"Works\" below) in a fire that left the Bradstreets homeless and with few personal belongings. By then, Anne's health was slowly failing. She suffered from tuberculosis and had to deal with the loss of cherished relatives. But her will remained strong and as a reflection of her religious devotion and knowledge of the Bible, she found peace in the firm belief that her daughter-in-law Mercy and her grandchildren were in heaven.\n\nAnne Bradstreet died on September 16, 1672, in North Andover, Massachusetts, at the age of 60. The precise location of her grave is uncertain but many historians believe her body is in the Old Burying Ground at Academy Road and Osgood Street in North Andover. In 1676, four years after the death of Anne, Simon Bradstreet married for a second time to a lady also named Anne (Gardiner). In 1697 Simon died and was buried in Salem.\n\nThis area of the Merrimack Valley is today described as \"The Valley of the Poets.\"\n\nA marker in the North Andover cemetery commemorates the 350th anniversary (2000) of the publishing of The Tenth Muse in London in 1650. That site and the Bradstreet Gate at Harvard, the memorial and pamphlets inside the Ipswich Public Library in Ipswich, MA, as well as the Bradstreet Kindergarten in North Andover may be the only places in America honoring her memory. As of 2015, the Bradstreet Kindergarten was torn down in North Andover. In the fall of 2018, The Anne Bradstreet Early Childhood Center was opened near Massachusetts Avenue in North Andover. Housing both preschool and kindergarten, the Anne Bradstreet ECC replaced the aged building named for her that had been on Main Street.\n\nWriting\n\nBackground\nAnne Bradstreet's education gave her advantages that allowed her to write with authority about politics, history, medicine, and theology. Her personal library of books was said to have numbered over 800, although many were destroyed when her home burned down. This event itself inspired a poem titled \"Upon the Burning of Our House July 10th, 1666\". At first, she rejects the anger and grief that this worldly tragedy has caused her; she looks toward God and the assurance of heaven as consolation, saying:\n\nHowever, in opposition to her Puritan ways, she also shows her human side, expressing the pain this event had caused her, that is, until the poem comes to its end: \n\nAs a younger poet, Bradstreet wrote five quaternions, epic poems of four parts each (see works below) that explore the diverse yet complementary natures of their subject. Much of Bradstreet's poetry is based on observation of the world around her, focusing heavily on domestic and religious themes, and was considered by Cotton Mather a monument to her memory beyond the stateliest marble. Long considered primarily of historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems \"Contemplations\", which was written for her family and not published until the mid-19th century. Bradstreet's work was deeply influenced by the poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas, who was favored by 17th-century readers.\n\nNearly a century later, Martha Wadsworth Brewster, a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, in her principal work, Poems on Diverse Subjects, was influenced and pays homage to Bradstreet's verse.\n\nDespite the traditional attitude toward women of the time, she clearly valued knowledge and intellect; she was a free thinker and some consider her an early feminist; unlike the more radical Anne Hutchinson, however, Bradstreet's feminism does not reflect heterodox, antinomian views.  Based on her poems, Bradstreet could also be considered to be a complementarian. An example of this is in her poem \"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory\", in which she praises Queen Elizabeth as proof that the common perceptions men held about women were wrong. She tends to focus on Elizabeth's ability to excel in more masculine areas, such as war, as we see in the lines below.\n\nIn 1647 Bradstreet's brother-in-law, Rev. John Woodbridge, sailed to England, carrying her manuscript of poetry. Although Anne later said that she did not know Woodbridge was going to publish her manuscript, in her self-deprecatory poem, \"\"The Author to Her Book\"\", she wrote Woodbridge a letter while he was in London, indicating her knowledge of the publication plan. Anne had little choice, however— as a woman poet, it was important for her to downplay her ambitions as an author. Otherwise, she would have faced criticism for being \"unwomanly.\" Anne's first work was published in London as The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America \"by a Gentlewoman of those Parts\".\n\nThe purpose of the publication appears to have been an attempt by devout Puritan men (i.e. Thomas Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, John Woodbridge) to show that a godly and educated woman could elevate her position as a wife and mother, without necessarily placing her in competition with men.\n\nIn 1678 her self-revised Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning was posthumously published in America, and included one of her most famous poems, \"To My Dear and Loving Husband\".\n\nThis volume is owned by the Stevens Memorial Library of North Andover and resides in the Houghton Library vault at Harvard.\n\nA quotation from Bradstreet can be found on a plaque at the Bradstreet Gate in Harvard Yard: \"I came into this Country, where I found a new World and new manners at which my heart rose.\" Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is \"But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston.\" This suggests her heart rose up in protest rather than in joy.\n\nRole of women\nMarriage played a large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, \"To My Dear And Loving Husband,\" she reveals that she is one with her husband. \"If ever two were one, then surely we.\" The Puritans believed marriage to be a gift from God. In another of Bradstreet's works, \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\", Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage. In the lines, \"And if I see not half my days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you;\" Bradstreet is saying that if she was to die soon, what would God give her husband. She could be referring to him possibly remarrying after she dies.  Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, \"These O protect from stepdame's injury\", Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future stepmother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage.\n\nThroughout \"Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment,\" Bradstreet states how she feels lost when her husband is not around and that life is always better when he is around. In Bradstreet's poems, it can be assumed she truly loved her husband and missed him when he was away from her and the family. Bradstreet does not resent her husband for leaving her with the family and with all of the household needs; she just misses him and wants him back with her.\n\nThe primary roles of women in Puritan society were to be wives and mothers and provide the family with their everyday needs. Women were expected to make clothing for the family, cook meals, keep the household clean, and teach the children how to live a Puritan lifestyle. Various works of Bradstreet are dedicated to her children. In works such as \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\" and \"In Reference to Her Children\", Bradstreet shows the love that she has for her children, both unborn and born. In Puritan society, children were also gifts from God, and she loved and cared for all of her children just as she loved and cared for her husband. She always believes they too are bound with her to make \"one.\"\n\nReception\n\nBecause writing was not considered to be an acceptable role for women at the time, Bradstreet was met with criticism. One of the most prominent figures of her time, John Winthrop, criticized Ann Hopkins, wife of prominent Connecticut colony governor Edward Hopkins. He mentioned in his journal that Hopkins should have kept to being a housewife and left writing and reading for men, \"whose minds are stronger.\" Despite heavy criticism of women during her time, Bradstreet continued to write which led to the belief that she was interested in rebelling against societal norms of the time.\n\nA prominent minister of the time, Thomas Parker, was also against the idea of women writing and sent a letter to his own sister saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were supposed to do. No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.\n\nLiterary style and themes\n\nBackground\n\nBradstreet let her homesick imagination marshall her store of learning, for the glory of God and for the expression of an inquiring mind and sensitive, philosophical spirit.\n\nWe see examples of this homesick imagination in her poem \"Dialogue Between Old England and New\" which emphasizes the relationship between the motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue. It also implies that whatever happens to England will also affect America. The poem often refers to England as \"mother\" and America as \"Daughter\", which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country.\n\nIntended audience\nAnne Bradstreet's works tend to be directed to members of her family and are generally intimate. For instance, in Bradstreet's \"To My Dear and Loving Husband\", the poem's intended audience is her husband, Simon Bradstreet. The focal point of this poem is the love that she has for her husband. \"I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold\". To Bradstreet, her husband's love is worth more than some of the best treasures that this earth has to offer. She also makes it a point to show to her husband that nothing can fill the love that she has for her husband. The lines, \"My love is such that rivers cannot quench,\" the rivers represent death, which she says the fire of her love is invulnerable to. The last line of the poem sums this up with the words, \"Then when we live no more, we may live ever.\"\n\nIn \"A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment\" Bradstreet writes a letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to describe her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer can be seen as a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. \"Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn.\" She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. \"Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence.\" One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.\n\nBy reading Bradstreet's works and recognizing her intended audience, one can get an idea of how life was for Puritan women. According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were to be seen and not heard in public, then one can say that most of their works are not meant for public consumption.\n\nBradstreet was not responsible for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet's brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her work off to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry was not meant to bring attention to herself. Though Bradstreet's works are renowned in today's world, it still was a great risk to have had her work published during the time in which she lived. Her being a published author would have not been considered as a typical role of the Puritan woman.\n\nThemes\n\nThe role of women is a common subject found in Bradstreet's poems. Living in a Puritan society, Bradstreet did not approve of the\nstereotypical idea that women were inferior to men during the 1600s. Women were expected to spend all their time cooking, cleaning, taking care of their children, and attending to their husband's every need. In her poem \"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,\" Bradstreet questions this belief.\n\n\"Now say, have women worth? or have they none?\nOr had they some, but with our queen is't gone?\nNay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long,\nBut she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong,\nLet such as say our Sex is void of Reason,\nKnow tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.\"\n\nAnother recurring subject in Bradstreet's work is mortality. In many of her works, she writes about her death and how it will affect her children and others in her life. The recurrence of this mortality theme can be viewed as autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, she was referring to her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings. She hoped her children would think of her fondly and honor her memory in her poem, \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children.\"\n\t\"If any worth or virtue were in me,\n\tLet that live freshly in thy memory.\"\n\nBradstreet is also known for using her poetry as a means to question her own Puritan beliefs; her doubt concerning God's mercy and her struggles to continue to place her faith in him are exemplified in such poems as \"Verses upon the Burning of our House\" and  \"In Memory of My Dear Grandchild\". Her works demonstrate a conflict that many Puritans would not have felt comfortable discussing, let alone writing.\n\nIn \"The Prologue,\" Bradstreet demonstrates how society trivialized the accomplishments of women. The popular belief that women should be doing other things like sewing, rather than writing poetry.\n\n\"I am obnoxious to each carping tongue\nWho says my hand a needle better fits,\nA poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong.\nFor such despite they cast on female wits:\nIf what I do prove well, it won't advance,\nThey'll say it's stol'n, or else it was by chance.\"\n\nIn \"To My Dear and Loving Husband,\" Bradstreet confesses her undying love for Simon saying \"Thy love is such I can no way repay, The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.\" Her deep passions can be found again in \"A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment.\" Her overt affections for her husband help readers to understand Bradstreet's temerity.\n\nAnne Bradstreet wrote in a different format than other writers of her time. This mainly is due to the fact that she wrote her feelings in a book not knowing someone would read them. In her poem \"A letter to my Husband\" she speaks about the loss of her husband when he is gone.\n\n\"I like the earth this season morn in black, my sun is gone.\" Here Anne is expressing her feelings of missing her husband when he is away.\n\n\"To my faults that well you know I have let be interred in my oblivious grave; if any worth of virtue were in me, let that live freshly in they memory\". Anne expresses the feeling she has of wanting her children to remember her in a good light not in a bad light.\n\nTone\nBradstreet often used a sarcastic tone in her poetry. In the first\nstanza of \"The Prologue\" she claims \"for my mean pen are too\nsuperior things\" referring to society's belief that she is unfit to\nwrite about wars and the founding of cities because she is a woman. In\nstanza five Bradstreet continues to display irony by stating \"who says\nmy hand a needle better fits\". This is another example of her\nsarcastic voice because society during this time expected women to\nperform household chores rather than write poetry.\n\nAlthough Anne Bradstreet endured many hardships in her life, her poems\nare usually written in a hopeful and positive tone. Throughout her\npoem In \"Memory of My Dear Grandchild Simon Bradstreet,\" she mentions\nthat even though she has lost her grandson in this world, she\nwill one day be reunited with him in Heaven. In \"Upon the\nBurning of Our House,\" Bradstreet describes her house in flames but\nselflessly declares \"there's wealth enough, I need no more.\" Although\nBradstreet lost many of her material items she kept a positive\nattitude and remained strong through God.\n\nQuaternions\nBradstreet wrote four quaternions, \"Seasons,\" \"Elements,\" \"Humours,\" and \"Ages,\" which made possible her \"development as a poet in terms of technical craftsmanship as she learned to fashion the form artistically.\"\n\nBradstreet's first two quaternions were her most successful. The central tension in her work is that between delight in the world and belief of its vanity.\n\nSelected works\n\nBefore the Birth of One of Her Children\nA Dialogue between Old England and New\nA Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment\nAnother\nAnother (II)\nFor Deliverance From A Fever\nDeliverance from Another Sore Fit\nContemplations (poem)\nIn Honour of that High and Mighty Princess, Queen Elizabeth\nIn Reference to her Children, 23 June 1659\nThe Author to Her Book\nThe Flesh and the Spirit\n The Four Ages of Man   (quaternion)\n Four Seasons of the Year (quaternion)\n Four Elements (quaternion)\n Of The Four Ages of Man (quaternion)\n The Four Monarchies  (quaternion)\nThe Prologue\nTo Her Father with Some Verses\nTo My Dear and Loving Husband\nUpon a Fit of Sickness, Anno 1632 Aetatis Suae, 19\nUpon My Son Samuel His Going For England, November 6, 1657\nUpon Some Distemper of Body\nVerses upon the Burning of our House\nThe Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America (1650) and, from the Manuscripts.

She was born in Northampton, England, and moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with her family in 1630. A pious Puritan, her writing was primarily religious and often addressed her love of husband and children. Anne Dwyer Bradstreet was the daughter of Thomas Dudley and Dorothy Yorke, both of whom were English Protestants. Her mother was originally from the affluent family of Ambrose and Margaret Yorke, both of whom had households of their own. It is thought that the mixture of their two households allowed for the most conducive learning environment for Anne. Anne was given a conventional education for women at the time, learning to read and write and was also taught scripture, poetry, arithmetic and a little Latin. Her main source of inspiration was from her family who encouraged Anne's writing from a young age. In 1628, Anne married Simon Bradstreet, who later became a colonial governor. After their marriage, Anne and Simon traveled to New England, where they became members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, founding Ipswich, Massachusetts. Throughout her life, Anne wrote hundreds of poems, many of which were published in her first book, \"The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America\" in 1650 by a London printer. In the seventeen poems that make up the book, she celebrates her Puritan faith and addresses personal feelings, especially in regards to her beloved husband and children. In the telling of her family life, she also reflects and honors the position of women in Puritan society. These poems were so well-received in England that they inspired a wave of colonists—mainly women—to write poetry inspired by the American experience. Anne was also a pioneer for female poets, writing about themes such as immortality, religion and mortality, which were normally written about by men. Through the main theme of her poetry, she was able to evoke meaning from her religious convictions, life experiences, and relationships. Her work profoundly affected religion and literature in the colonies, as well as gaining her recognition in the world of English literature, making her a very influential poet in colonial America. Anne Bradstreet died of an unknown illness on September 16, 1672. She left behind a legacy of written works that have been studied, admired and continued to be adapted for centuries after her death, symbolizing a strong woman of faith. Her impactful poems have permanently secured her a place in the history of literature.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 333510}

It covers approximately 68 square miles in the northeasternmost section of the county.\n\nThe school district consists of two schools:  Algoma High School and Algoma Elementary School.\n\nThe school mascot is the Wolf and its colors are Gold and Black.\n\nHistory\nThe Algoma School District was organized in 1876 with the building of its first school house, located on the corner of Fremont and Sixth Street, in front of what is now the Algoma Elementary School, in 1876. The small two-story building had a large cupola on top.\n\nIn 1905, a major addition was added in front of this building, doubling its size. By the Great Depression, though, the building was in disrepair due to poor upkeep practices.\n\nAs part of the Public Works Administration program instituted by the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration, Algoma was eligible for help in building a new Grade and high school in 1934.  Features of this new building included an ornate auditorium; a full-court gymnasium; a kindergarten room with functioning fireplace and child-sized bathroom; and a music room with soundproofing.\n\nIn 1955, a wing was added to this building to accommodate the increasing enrollment due to the number of school district consolidations that were happening during this time.  The wing included new classrooms for the teaching of business education, home economics, agriculture and English.  This addition is prominent, as the original building was done in dark stain and the addition was wood stained in blond.\n\nIn 1966, the voters of the district decided to build a new high school on a plat of farmland then located to the south of Algoma with the stipulation that no more than $1.5 million was spent on the new structure.  This new building opened in the fall of 1969 with the old high school becoming an elementary school and the remaining rural schoolhouses closed, either to be sold or eventually demolished.\n\nIn 1997, a referendum was passed to renovate the high school and elementary school to meet Title X requirements.  The high school was fitted with a new weightlifting room to replace the old one that had become part of the girls' locker room and the elementary school had an addition to replace older locker rooms.\n\nIn 2014, permits were granted for the District to build a new community center and tech center to be attached to the current high school.

In 1910, Rasneur learned the basics of aeronautics before joining the French army in 1912, where he received extensive military flying training. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Rasneur was deployed to the French Airforce. During the war, he flew over 700 successful combat missions and was credited with shooting down three enemy aircraft. He was twice named a Chevalier of the Legion of Merit throughout his career and was twice awarded the Croix de Guerre. After the end of the war, Rasneur retired from military life. He worked his way up in the private aviation industry and eventually became a famed aeronautical engineer. From the mid-1920s, Rasneur was part of the pioneering cross-Atlantic flights that initiated international air travel.

She was used by the Union Navy as a ship's tender in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.\n\nAlbermarle and Lion seized by Union Navy forces \n\nOn the morning of 26 March 1862, sidewheel gunboat Delaware—during an expedition to the Pungo River in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, in search of Confederate shipping reported to be there—entered Pantego Creek and found two large schooners at its head . . . \"which,\" he reported, \"proved to be the Albemarle and Lion owned by Boyle and Richard Reddick, of Suffolk, Virginia.\"\n\nTwo armed boats from the Union warship took possession of the Southern vessels, towed them down stream, and anchored them at the mouth of the creek. Early the next morning, Delaware received on board several families who professed loyalty to the Union and asked for protection. Later that day, the gunboat and its prizes then proceeded to New Bern, North Carolina.\n\nAssigned as a store ship for Union Navy blockade ships \n\nLittle information of the prizes' movements during ensuing months seems to have survived, but Albemarle apparently remained in the North Carolina sounds. In any case, she and a schooner named Knockern were reported on 3 February 1863 to be off New Bern serving as storeships for Union forces in the sounds. On 4 May 1863, a report from Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles stated that Albemarle was still there performing in the same capacity.\n\nNorth Carolina support operations \n\nOnly five days later, the Union Navy purchased the schooner from the New York City prize court. The fact that the schooner was serving as a storeship in the sounds during the ensuing summer strongly suggests that she never left North Carolina waters but was condemned in absentia.

She was the first warship in the United States Navy to carry the name. The ship was laid down on 24 August 1862 by the Perine, Patterson & Stack Yard of Port Dover, New York and was launched on 19 December 1863. It was commissioned on 19 May 1864 with Commander Simeon B. Derickson in command. At the time of the Albemarle's launching, the North was in need of unarmored, shallow draft steam vessels with shallow draft and heavy cannon armament, so the Albemarle was designed for this purpose. The vessel's armament comprised one XV-inch Dahlgren gun, one X-inch Dahlgren 18-pounder gun, two XI-inch Dahlgren 12-pounder guns, and four 24-pounder seacoast howitzers. The hull was constructed from a combination of wood, iron and sailcloth, making it both strong and light-weight. Albemarle’s war history began when she set out for Plymouth, North Carolina, in June 1864. Her mission was to patrol the mouth of the Roanoke River and the Carolina coast, and to conduct bombardment raids on Confederate positions. She played a key role in the Capture of Plymouth, North Carolina. Albemarle, along with four other gunboats and several mortar boats, attacked the city and compelled its surrender. Her mission accomplished, she then proceeded back up the Pamilco River. On 11 November 1864, Albemarle was caught up in a critical incident in the Albemarle River when she attempted to stop a Confederate raiding party on the Ocracoke to Dollar Point (Kinnakeet) road. As she proceeded along the river, she was suddenly flanked by two powerful Confederate rams, CSS Roanoke and CSS Chickamauga. Although there was a fierce exchange of fire, both sides were eventually driven back. Albemarle continued to spend the rest of the war patrolling the waters around Plymouth and Washington, North Carolina, and engaging in harassing operations. On 17 April 1865, she and several other Union gunboats fired a salute of twenty-one guns signifying the end of the war in this region. After the war, Albemarle was sold to James Marine of New York in December 1865 and on 1 January 1866, she was re-christened Clyde for the ailing merchant marine. She did not see further naval service and the later fates of the ship remain unclear. Sister ships of USS Albemarle include CSS Albemarle and USS Nantucket. The ship was unique in its feat of surviving a powder magazine explosion and it's rams attacks, and continues to be remembered for its contribution to the Union's victory during the Civil War.

Typically, tightwire performances either include dance or object manipulation. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as clubs, rings, hats, or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer's centre of mass above their support point—usually their feet.\n\nHighwire is a form of tightwire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tightwire becomes highwire, generally a wire over  high are regarded as a highwire act.\n\nSkywalk is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall buildings, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.\n\nRopes\nIf the \"lay\" of the rope (the orientation of the constituent strands, the \"twist\" of a rope) is in one direction, the rope can twist on itself as it stretches and relaxes. Underfoot, this could be hazardous to disastrous in a tightrope. One solution is for the rope core to be made of steel cable, laid in the opposite direction to the outer layers, so that twisting forces balance each other out.\n\nBiomechanics\nAcrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms, or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced.  In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.\n\nA wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition, the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.\n\nTightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full-length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises, while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.\n\nFamous tightrope artists\n\nCharles Blondin, a.k.a.

For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\n \nCircus skills", "machine_text": " Tightrope walking is an acrobatic feat of balance and skill. It is also known as funambulism and refers to the act of walking or running across a rope or wire that is suspended from two points of support. It has become a popular form of entertainment, often performed with a theatrical style, in which a performer crosses the rope in a range of daring feats. Tightrope walking has been practiced for centuries, but it has evolved over time to become one of the most iconic and thrilling acts in the world of entertainment. Tightrope walking is known to date back to ancient Egypt, but its first recorded performance was attributed to a Chinese monk who crossed a rope between two pagodas in the 6th century. During the Renaissance, tightrope walking was seen as a show of skill and daring, often combined with juggling or fire-eating. It has since gained popularity in Europe and North America. Since the late 19th century, tightrope walking has become a specialty in the circus arts. It is often performed on an elevated moving tightrope which is securely tensioned between two points of support and long enough for the walk to take place. Performers often make use of poles or other aids to maintain balance, though this varies by artist. Motorcycles, unicycles, and even animals such as horses and cows have increasingly been seen performing tightrope walking during recent circus acts. Whilst a dangerous feat, professionals utilize a number of techniques to make the stunt as safe as possible, such as netting or airbag mats to reduce injury should a performer happen to fall. Tightrope walking has become a sensation, with daredevils regularly performing feats of increasingly greater heights and more remarkable tricks. The sport has also spawned its own subculture, with numerous enthusiasts practicing their own walking and performing their own stunts. Social media has also catapulted the sport into the spotlight, with numerous videos depicting brave feats of tightrope walking receiving millions of views and shares. Despite its inherent danger, tightrope walking remains a source of entertainment and delight. It is an enduring symbol of the human capacity to overcome obstacles and is widely celebrated for its mesmerizing spectacle.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 511445}

It is commonly known as the moldy melon fungus because it often infects and develops inside ripened melons, causing the fruit to decay. The fungus is found worldwide, and is an important plant pathogen in home gardens and commercial fruit farms. Description Choanephora cucurbitarum is a cosmopolitan species of Ascomycete fungus with characteristics that vary depending on its environment. Its morphology ranges from asexual to sexual, and is monitored by a scale of spore production. The asexual conidium is globose to widely ellipsoid and has a range of color including yellow, white, cream and pink. Its conidiophores are simple to branched, and may occur singly or in pairs. The sexual ascocarp is a cleistothecium, which is small and dark when wet, and becomes smaller, darker and more wrinkled when dry. Life cycle Choanephora cucurbitarum has both asexual and sexual stages that vary depending on environmental conditions. The primary stage of its life cycle is the asexual ascospora, which can germinate within minutes in warm temperatures, forming mycelia that extend from the surface of the host material. The mycelia then form conidia, which are released into the air and fall on the surface of other ripe or mildly damaged cucurbit fruits, initiating infection. In cooler temperatures, the asexual stage can transform into a sexual fruiting body known as a cleistothecium. The ascocarps are able to produce ascospores, which are released into the environment and can travel long distances. The ascospores then infect new host materials, where the cycle begins again. Types of damage Choanephora cucurbitarum can cause a range of physical and physiological damages to cucurbit fruits. Its symptoms are first visible on the surface of the fruit as a grey-white mycelial fan that often results in an irregular spot known as a 'bluish lesion'. This lesion can penetrate deep into the flesh of the fruit and cause watery cavities on the surface and in the core, which can eventually lead to extensive decay. In addition, the fungus can induce premature softening of the fruit which can affect its marketability. Management The most important element in managing Choanephora cucurbitarum is prevention, as the fungus can cause extensive damages to cucurbit fruits. One of the most effective methods is to select disease-resistant varieties and also to practice sanitary and integrated pest management systems. Application of fungicides is also useful in controlling the fungus, though frequent and regular applications may be necessary. Harvesting of cucurbits at the right stage of maturity and prompt refrigeration may also reduce the risk of infection.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11322437}

When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas. Tony is a film and television writer, director and producer.\n\nHis sister-in-law is puppeteer and ventriloquist Shari Lewis, who is famous for performing Lamb Chop.

She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nEarly life and career \nShe was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill, she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Björling and Birgit Nilsson.\n\nAfter returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero née Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist.  This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom.\n\nSadler's Wells\nOnce in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company.  Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America.\n\nLater career and death\nIn 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970.  During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career, she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers.\n\nHer retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons.   She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years.\n \nShe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977.  On 5 June 2006, she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85.   She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 births\n2006 deaths\nAustralian operatic sopranos\nSingers from Melbourne\nAustralian Officers of the Order of the British Empire\n20th-century Australian women opera singers", "machine_text": " Elizabeth Fretwell is an American businesswoman and philanthropist who has served on a number of corporate boards, including The American Heart Association, Microsoft, and The Business Roundtable.

The city sits next to Keystone Lake and claims to be the \"Striped Bass Capital of the World\".\n\nHistory\nThe town name is derived from \"Mann's Ford\", a crossing of the Cimarron River where Tom and Hazel Mann had received a Creek allotment. The Arkansas Valley and Western Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad (commonly called \"Frisco\") built a line through this area in 1902–03, making it an important cattle shipping point. A post office was established April 11, 1903.\n\nWhen the Army Corps of Engineers began making plans for flood control that would flood the town of Mannford, citizens formed a plan to relocate several miles southeast of the original site. The move was completed in 1963.\n\nOn August 3, 2012, a wildfire started several miles south of Mannford. Carried by strong south winds and extremely dry vegetation, the fire pushed up into the Mannford area and caused evacuations of the town. The fire burned over , edging into the town and destroying dozens of buildings.\n\nGeography\nMannford is  west of Tulsa on State Highway 51. It is situated on both sides of a southwest arm of Keystone Lake, a reservoir on the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lightweighting\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lightweighting is a concept in the auto industry about building cars and trucks that are less heavy as a way to achieve better fuel efficiency and handling. Carmakers make parts from carbon fiber, windshields from plastic, and bumpers out of aluminum foam, as ways to lessen vehicle load. Replacing car parts with lighter materials does not lessen overall safety for drivers, according to one view, since many plastics have a high strength-to-weight ratio. \n\nThe search to replace car parts with lighter ones is not limited to any one type of part; according to a spokesman for Ford Motor Company, engineers strive for lightweighting \"anywhere we can.\" Using lightweight materials such as plastics can mean less strain on the engine and better gas mileage as well as improved handling. One material sometimes used to reduce weight is carbon fiber. The auto industry has used the term for many years, as the effort to keep making cars lighter is ongoing. \n\nAnother common material used for lightweighting is aluminum. Incorporating aluminum has grown continuously to not only meet CAFE standards, but to also improve automotive performance. A vehicle with lower weight has better acceleration, braking and handling. In addition, lighter vehicles can tow and haul larger loads because the engine is not carrying unnecessary weight. A light\nweighting magazine finds: \"Even though aluminum is light, it does not sacrifice strength. Aluminum body structure is equal in strength to steel and can absorb twice as much crash-induced energy.\"\n\nReferences\n\nAutomotive technologies\nMaterials science\nEnvironmental engineering", "machine_text": " Lightweighting is a process for reducing the overall mass of a product or system. It is a popular approach for engineers and designers needing to improve the strength-to-weight ratio in the products they create. There are several methods for lightweighting, and the optimal approach will depend on the context and the desired outcomes. Lightweighting strategies focus on three primary areas: material choices, component designs, and part assembly methods. The type of material chosen for a project will greatly affect its weight. As lightweight materials become lighter and stronger, the weight of products can be reduced without sacrificing strength and durability. Novel composite materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics, are being used in more application than ever before. Engineers and product designers also employ advanced design techniques to reduce weight and material usage. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools are used to identify weak points in the design where additional strength is not needed. This informations helps to ensure products are designed to be as lightweight as possible without compromising on function or safety. Assembly methods also play a significant role in lightweighting. Many manufacturers are opting to combine multiple components into single parts to reduce the overall number of parts in a system. This reduces weight and assembly time by eliminating the need to build and align separate parts. Adhesives and fasteners have also become popular methods for attaching parts, as they are lighter and more secure than conventional hardware. Lightweighting is increasingly important for the automotive industry, where reducing the mass of a vehicle can have a dramatic effect on fuel efficiency. Automakers are rapidly adopting more efficient materials and design techniques to create lighter vehicles that maintain their structural integrity and safety features. Lightweighting offers a number of advantages, including improved energy efficiency, reduced emissions, and increased design freedom. With increasing customer demand for lighter and more efficient products, lightweighting will continue to be an important tool in the design process. Through innovative material choices, advanced design strategies, and modern assembly methods, engineers and product designers are creating products that are stronger, lighter, and more sustainable.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46381123}

This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.\n\nAnalysis\nGreece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.\n\nThe painting borrows elements from Christianity.

Taking place during the Greek War of Independence, the painting depicts the Third Siege of Messolonghi, a pivotal event of the Greek struggle against the Ottoman Empire. The painting is considered a masterpiece of the neoclassical school of painting, and has become a symbol of Greek independence. It is displayed in the Musée du Louvre, in Paris. The painting measures 375.5 centimetres by 460.2 centimetres (almost 12 feet by 15 feet). The painting is a large-scale neoclassical composition set during a period of intense conflict in the early 19th century. Delacroix chose to focus on a single moment from the Third Siege of Missolonghi: the surrender of the Greek city to the Ottoman empire. The painting depicts a monk-like figure, wearing a white robe and a red hat, standing amidst the ruins of the city. He is raising his arm up in a gesture of defiance, while the figures around him are brought to tears and grief. The painting displays a range of emotions, from heroic defiance to sorrow and mourning, and is intended to be an expression of the courage and suffering of the Greeks during their War of Independence. In the foreground of the painting is a woman, kneeling with her arm raised, her face contorted in grief. She is flanked by a group of Greek citizens, young and old, visible in the bits and pieces of the city's ruins. Both the woman and the people around her represent the human cost of war and the futility of resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. The painting is a stirring homage to the courage of the Greek people and their struggle for independence. The painting has come to be seen as a symbol of the struggle for freedom and democracy which gave form to the modern Greek identity. Eugène Delacroix's painting of Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi remains one of the most powerful and iconic images of the Greek War of Independence.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29627849}

It is located just east of the tail of the constellation at the boundary with Aries, and is close to the celestial equator. It is visible to the naked eye, although binoculars make it easier to observe. Sigma Piscium is a yellow-white F-type main sequence star with a mean apparent magnitude of 4.9. It is about 2.4 billion years old, and has an estimated radius of 1.8 solar radii. It has a 3.4 solar mass and is about 2,600 light-years away from the Earth. It has an effective temperature of 7,220 K. Sigma Piscium is a single star, with no visible stellar companions. It has a relatively weak magnetic field with a strength of 84 ± 5 G, which is typical of a main sequence star of its spectral type. It is a slow rotator, with a rotational period of 200 days. Sigma Piscium is visible in the night sky all year round, even though it does not rise to peak visibility until the end of winter. It can be found at the same position as the constellation of Pisces in the northern sky, and can be used as an anchor point for locating other stars in the area. As a relatively easy target for amateur astronomers, Sigma Piscium is sometimes used as a point of reference while guiding beginners in their star-viewing practices. Its luminosity can also be easily observed with the most basic of astronomical instruments such as a pair of binoculars, allowing the observer to obtain a rough estimate of its surface temperature and rotational period. Sigma Piscium is known to science since antiquity, although it was not until the 19th century when its classification as an F-type star was established. As a relatively bright star, Sigma Piscium is of interest to professional astronomers. A common practice is to use it as a reference star while observing and measuring the brightness of stars in its vicinity, so as to obtain a better understanding of the light-years' distance from its neighbors. In the Chinese sky, Sigma Piscium is known as 'Wei She' and represented part of a large asterism called 'Bear Blocking the Way'.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vagenetia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vagenetia or Vagenitia () was a medieval region on the coast of Epirus, roughly corresponding to modern Thesprotia. The region likely derived its name from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai. It is first attested as a sclavinia under some sort of Byzantine control in the 8th/9th centuries, passed under Bulgarian rule in the late 9th century, and returned to Byzantine rule in the 11th. It passed to the Despotate of Epirus after 1204, where it formed a separate province. Vagenetia came under Albanian rule in the 1360s, until conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1430.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region's name derives from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai, who appear in the early 7th century during the Slavic invasions of the Balkans. Already during the 8th century, the Byzantine Empire tried to re-impose some control over the region, as a seal of office attests the presence of a civil governor (\"Theodore, basilikos spatharios and archon of Vagenitia\"), but the reading of the latter is not certain. Byzantine administration is securely attested towards the end of the 9th century, with the presence of both a bishop called Stephen in the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 879, and the seal of a civil governor (the basilikos protospatharios and archon Ilarion) from the turn of the 10th century. \n\nThe historian Predrag Komatina suggests that the bishopric was an \"ethnic\" bishopric for the Baiounitai (but with Greek-language liturgy), which then was succeeded by the Slavic-language episcopate of Clement of Ohrid (893–916), which was not organized on a territorial, but on an ethnic basis, and had no fixed centre. Clement's roving episcopate was gradually replaced by bishoprics based in the various cities of the area. At the time of Clement's activity in the area, and during the early 10th century, Vagenetia and its wider area was ruled by the First Bulgarian Empire; thus the local church also became part of the Bulgarian Church, and later of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The ultimate descendant of the bishopric of Vagenetia was likely the see of Himara.\n\nVagenetia is next mentioned in literary sources in the Alexiad, which describes how, in 1082, the Italo-Normans under Bohemund crossed the region to capture Ioannina. In the Partitio Romaniae of 1204, Vagenetia appears as a chartoularaton (a special district type indicating Slavic settlement) in the province of Dyrrhachium. \n\nIn 1205, it is listed by Marino Zeno, the Podestà of Constantinople, among the territories accorded to the Republic of Venice by the Partitio. In Zeno's account, it is a separate province, distinct from Dyrrhachium, and in turn includes the chartoularaton of Glyky, north of Arta (which previously probably belonged to the Byzantine province of Nicopolis. Apart from the region of Dyrrhachium, however, the Venetians failed to consolidate their rule over most of the lands accorded to them in Epirus, and possession of Vagenetia passed to the Despotate of Epirus, where it is attested as a separate province (provincia in Latin, thema in Greek) within the Epirote state as early as the 1210 treaty between Michael I Komnenos Doukas and Venice. \n\nIn 1228, Theodore Komnenos Doukas confirmed possession of lands \"on the island of Corfu and the thema of Vagenetia\" to the Metropolitan of Corfu. In 1292, the coasts of the province were raided by Genoese ships in Byzantine employ, and two years later, the province was promised to Philip of Taranto as part of the dowry of Thamar Angelina Komnene. Still, the Despot of Epirus Thomas I Komnenos Doukas was ascribed the title of \"Duke of Vagenetia\" in a  Venetian document in 1313. In 1315, a document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople records that Vagenetia belonged to the bishopric of Himara.\n\nDuring the Albanian invasions of Epirus in the 1360s, many of the local Greeks fled to Ioannina. In 1382, the Albanian ruler John Spata gave the region, along with Bela and Dryinopolis, to his son-in-law Marchesino. In the early 1400s, the local Albanian ruler John Zenevisi is referred to in some Venetian documents as the \"sebastokrator of Vagenetia\". His grandson, Simon Zenevisi, with Venetian backing built the fortress of Strovili \"at the cape of Vagenetia\" across the island of Corfu in 1443.\n\nMost of Epirus fell under Ottoman rule in 1430, and in 1431, the Ottoman cadaster attests the existence of a province of Vayonetya. The name survived to the end of the century in various variants (Viyanite, Viyantiye), but the name vanishes thereafter, apart from a village Vagenetion south of Ioannina and an isolated reference to a \"Greater Vagenetia\" (μεγάλη Βαγενετία) in the 17th century.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the historian Stojan Novaković, followed by Peter Soustal and Johannes Koder in the Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Vagenetia was the coastal strip between the Ionian Sea and the Pindus Mountains that extended from Himara in the north to Margariti in the south. However, Komatina objects that these boundaries reflect the situation in the 13th–14th centuries, and that the earlier, original region, the chartoularaton of Vagenetia, was much smaller. Komatina points out that after 1205, Vagenetia came to include the district of Glyky to the south, but the original territory was just the northern part of the expanded province. Komatina identifies this with the territory referred to by John Apokaukos as \"Lesser Vagenetia\" (μικρὰ Βαγενετία), namely the area around the valley of the Aoös. This also corresponds to the Ottoman province, which comprised Himara and its hinterlands, with Delvina as its centre.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n \n\nMedieval Epirus\nHistorical regions in Albania\nHistorical regions in Greece\nThesprotia\nSclaveni\nProvinces of the Byzantine Empire\nSubdivisions of the Ottoman Empire\nDefunct dioceses of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople", "machine_text": " Vagenetia is a small town located in the north eastern part of Alberta, Canada.

Settlers were attracted by the lush vegetation and breathtaking scenery that the area had to offer. White settlers in the area were soon joined by other European immigrants, including Stoney and Cree First Nations people. The population of the small town slowly grew as settlers moved in and created farms and businesses, and by 1925 the population was estimated to be around 147 people. Although the town has always been small, it has experienced economic growth over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, a sawmill was built and provided employment to many of the residents. Tourism also became a large part of the town’s economy, as the scenery, peaceful environment and nearby parks made Vagenetia an attractive destination for outdoors enthusiasts. Today, Vagenetia has a population of around 500 people. It continues to be a peaceful and scenic place to live and its economy is strong.

His parents divorced when he was in the third grade and his mother began running a boarding house.\n\nAfter spending two years at Kansas State University, Peterson earned his B.A. at the University of Kansas and then took his Ph.D. in the history of American civilization at Harvard University.\n\nCareer\nAfter teaching at Brandeis and Princeton, Peterson was hired to teach at the University of Virginia, which remained his academic home for the rest of his life. He succeeded the great Jefferson biographer Dumas Malone there and ultimately became Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History.\n\nWorks\nPeterson adapted his dissertation as his first book, The Jefferson Image in the American Mind (Oxford University Press, 1960), which won the 1961 Bancroft Prize for History.  It is still hailed as a pioneering exploration of the history of American memory, which has become an increasingly important topic for historians. Peterson undertook the work to assess what history had made of Thomas Jefferson. At the end of a decade, he published a lengthy one-volume biography, Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation (Oxford University Press, 1970), which he considered his most important book. His 1994 Lincoln in American Memory, was written from a similar stance as his first book on Jefferson. It was a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for biography.\n \nPeterson's shorter studies include works on John Brown, President Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson's biographer, Ray Stannard Baker.  Peterson edited several anthologies of Jefferson's writings.\n\nIn 1988, Peterson published another landmark work, The Great Triumvirate: Webster, Clay, and Calhoun (Oxford University Press), a joint biography of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun.\n\nPart of a generation that was admonished in its youth to \"remember the starving Armenians,\" Peterson traveled to Armenia in 1997 as a Peace Corps volunteer and was moved by the country’s troubled history.  After research, he edited a collection of essays published by the University of Virginia Press under the title \"Starving Armenians\": America and the Armenian Genocide 1915-1930 and After (2004), which explores the American response to the violence against and dispersion of the Armenian people during and after World War I, when more than 1.5 million of the country's minority population died.  He begins with the initial reports to President Woodrow Wilson from Henry Morgenthau, Sr., his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.  Peterson also covers the contemporary period and the continuing campaign by ethnic Armenians and others to convince the U.S. government to officially recognize the actions as genocide, which Turkey has denied.\n\nLegacy and honors\n2005, the Library of Virginia gave Peterson its Literary Lifetime Achievement Award.\n1997, the First Freedom Council's National First Freedom Award \n1994, the Virginia Foundation for Humanities 20th Anniversary Award \n1994, the University of Virginia Phi Beta Kappa Book Award, and \n1960, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Gold Medal.\n\nPeterson died at Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 23, 2009.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Brief biography\n\n20th-century American historians\n20th-century American male writers\nWriters from Manhattan, Kansas\nWriters from Charlottesville, Virginia\nHarvard University alumni\n1921 births\n2009 deaths\nBancroft Prize winners\nHistorians from Virginia\nAmerican male non-fiction writers\nKansas State University alumni\nUniversity of Kansas alumni\nUniversity of Virginia faculty\nBrandeis University alumni\nPrinceton University alumni", "machine_text": " Merrill D.

In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. WSET and WBZA broadcast at 1410 AM with a \"daytime only\" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6am. In 1971, the format was flipped to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230, in late 1982; that station is now WMML, a sister station to WENU.\n\nCurrent station\nFrom 1982 to 1988, the 1410 frequency previously occupied by WBZA was off the air, until returning as country music station WSTL in 1988. The station took on the WBZA call letters in early January 1998, and changed again in September 2000 to the current WENU.\n\nFor a time being, WENU was a simulcast of the FM station, now WNYQ, with an Adult Standards format.

According to the 2015 census, the city had 231,107 inhabitants. Its metropolitan area has 381,432 inhabitants and a population density of 29.88 inhabitants per square kilometer. Monclova is the third-largest city and metropolitan area in the state in terms of population, after Torreón and Saltillo.\n\nThe city accounts for the highest production of steel of Mexico and Latin America, hence its nickname \"The Steel Capital\".\n\nToday Monclova has one of the highest levels of commercial, industrial, and financial development, and is currently has one of the lowest poverty rates among Mexican cities. Its metropolitan area is among the 10 most competitive urban areas in the country, and it also has one of the highest labor productivity rates.\n\nHistory\nEstablished on July 25, 1577 by Spanish colonists, Monclova became the first city in the region known as Coahuila, which later became the State of Coahuila.\n\nDuring the colonial period and the early 19th century, Monclova served as the capital of Nueva Extremadura. It remained the capital for a few years after Mexico's independence. Prior to 1840, haciendas near Monclova were the headquarters of the Sánchez Navarro latifundio, the largest private landholding in the Americas.\n\nDuring the initial battle for independence from Spain, fleeing rebel leaders who had been captured at the Wells of Baján were first taken to Monclova before the long trip to the city of Chihuahua. The captured leaders were Juan Aldama, Ignacio Allende, Miguel Hidalgo, and Jose Mariano Jimenez.  \n\nWith the adoption of the 1824 Constitution, which created the state of Coahuila y Tejas, the capital was transferred to Saltillo. In 1828, the decision was overturned when Monclova was declared the capital of the new state, but the state legislature continued to convene in Saltillo. On March 9, 1833, the state legislature settled the dispute in Monclova's favour, and the decision was ratified by President Antonio López de Santa Anna on December 2, 1834.\n\nWith the enactment of the 1836 Constitutional Laws, by which the federal republic was converted into a centralised one, the state of Coahuila y Tejas was divided into two departments, Coahuila and Tejas (or Texas, as it would later become). Saltillo was confirmed as Coahuila's capital.

In recent decades the hottest records have climbed as high as  on July 13, 2005 and  on May 4, 1984. However nighttime low temperatures are typically 15 degrees cooler than daytime highs, due to the very arid conditions. Even in July, the warmest month, temperatures have gotten as low as  in 1975.

The warmer months of the year are typically wetter than the cooler ones.

AllMusic's Andy Kellman wrote that \"the material, while mostly well-crafted, runs together as a block of slow, serious songs broken up by only a couple brief upswings in energy\" and how \"Chrisette, naturally, sounds outstanding throughout, as a supernaturally talented vocalist whose songs are nonetheless easily relatable to anyone going through a breakup—or, to a significantly lesser extent here, newfound love.\" He also felt that the album \"could have really used more rhythmic punch than a token throwback strutter.\" Maiya Norton of Vibe commented on how her album gained some edge, expressing some anger and heartbreak.\n\nDespite noting its production as a weakness, Miami Herald writer Adrian Ruhi gave the album 3 out of 4 stars and commended Michele for her vocals. In a positive review, The Koalition said that \"it would seem almost impossible for Chrisette Michele to avoid the \"sophomore slump\", but she finds a way by simply catering to an age old rule: just create great pieces of music.\" In some reviews her voice has been compared to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald. Giving the album four out of five stars, Timothy Michael Carson of About.com favored her unique, distinctive strong vocals, her cohesiveness, and the song \"Blame It on Me\", but was disappointed in the fact it had less of a jazz influence than her debut album I Am.\n\nCommercial performance\nEpiphany debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 83,000 units, giving Michele her first number 1 album on the chart.\n\nTrack listing\n \"Epiphany (I'm Leaving)\" (Shaffer Smith, Chuck Harmony) – 3:28\n \"Notebook\" (Harmony, Claude Kelly) – 3:46\n \"What You Do\" (feat.

Erika Ramirez from Billboard praised Michele's \"strong, soulful voice\" and noted that the album \"shines with a classic sound reminiscent of classic soul and gospel\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman thought that Michele, who wrote and co-wrote most of the songs on the album, effectively bridged contemporary trends with classic sounds. He noted, \"With the steady pulse of rap-inflected soul, silky midtempo funk, and dusty-sounding lite-funk and balladry, the sounds are distinctive, not retreaded.\" The album spawned five singles: \"Be OK\", \"If I Have My Way\", \"Love Is You\", \"Best of Me\" and the title track, \"Epiphany (I'm Leaving)\". \"Be OK\" was the most successful single from the album, charting in the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and becoming Michele's highest charting single on that chart. The single was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on March 18, 2008, and has sold 866,000 copies in the United States. In 2009, Michele decided to leave Def Jam and release her next projects independently. Following this decision, Michele released her second studio album, entitled Epiphany: The Gratitude Edition - the album was a re-issue of her debut album with five bonus tracks of her own added on - as a double disc, with the original and bonus pieces on different discs.

There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide.

She was also involved in sexual slavery (known then as \"white slavery\") and child prostitution, often arranging the abduction of children by offering to watch children while parents went to collect luggage or purchase train tickets.\n\nAmong her brothels in Church Street and Kensington as well as a flagellation house in Hampstead, included a \"chamber of horrors\" in Gray's Inn Road where a room was designed for the purposes of sado-masochism as described by journalist William Thomas Stead in a series of articles for the Pall Mall Gazette exposing prostitution in the city during the Eliza Armstrong case. Although never proven, she may have operated a white slave house along the river near Kew, from which women were abducted and smuggled to foreign countries (see Sexual slavery and Human trafficking).\n\nIn 1884, the Alfred Dyer's London Committee obtained evidence of a high class Chelsea brothel operated by Jeffries. An investigation by a former police inspector, who had resigned from the Metropolitan Police when senior officials refused to prosecute her, had been amassing evidence against Jeffries during the year until the London Commission began a private prosecution in March 1885.\n\nAlthough unable to charge Jeffries with any serious offence apart from keeping a disorderly house, the Commission expected much publicity from the case when presenting their evidence. For example, a former housemaid testified that she witnessed an assault on a 13-year-old girl who had been whipped by a belt and raped by a customer.\n\nAppearing in court on May 5, accompanied by several wealthy army officers, Jeffries paid a fine of £200 after arranging with the court to plead guilty in order to have the evidence against her remain undisclosed.

This came at a time when the government were negotiating peace terms to end the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession, which were unlikely to pass the Lords where opposition Whigs and some Tories had joined together to block them under the slogan \"No Peace Without Spain\".\n\nCreation\nTwo of the men, Lord Bruce and Lord Compton, were heirs to existing earldoms and were advanced to the house in their own right using their father's baronies. Others included Harley's son-in-law George Hay as well as George Granville, Thomas Mansel, Thomas Trevor, Thomas Foley all of whom were close political allies of the First Minister. Most controversial was that of Samuel Masham, the husband of Queen Anne's favourite Abigail Hill, a cousin and ally of Harley. While Bruce's letters patent were dated 31 December 1711, the other creations all took place on the subsequent day 1 January 1712. When Parliament resumed on 2 January they took their seats. Because their numbers resembled that of a jury, the Whig Lord Wharton mockingly asked if they were going to speak individually or elect a foreman to do so.\n\nAftermath\nDespite the controversy Harley was able to subsequently pass the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. However, the narrow Tory majority in the Lords disappeared in 1714 following the Hanoverian Succession when the Tory government was replaced by George I. Harley's alleged abuse of royal power and the violation of the constitution were part of the articles of impeachment against him, when he was prosecuted by Parliament in 1715. \n\nIn 1719 partly in a response to Harley's earlier creations, the Whig government of James Stanhope proposed a Peerage Bill which would have largely limited further expansion of the House of Lords. However, this was defeated and the size of the Lords continued to grow during the eighteenth century.\n\nFull list of the new peers\n Allen Bathurst, created Baron Bathurst\n Charles Bruce, Viscount Bruce of Ampthill, created Baron Bruce by acceleration\n James Compton, Lord Compton, created Baron Compton by acceleration\n Thomas Foley, created Baron Foley\n George Granville, created Baron Landsdowne\n George Hay, Viscount Dupplin, created Baron Hay\n Sir Thomas Mansel, 5th Baronet, created Baron Mansel\n Samuel Masham, created Baron Masham\n Henry Paget, created Baron Burton\n Thomas Trevor, created Baron Trevor\n Sir Thomas Willoughby, 2nd Baronet, created Baron Middleton\n Thomas Windsor, 1st Viscount Windsor, created Baron Mountjoy (Viscount Windsor was a title in the Peerage of Ireland and therefore did not entitled Lord Windsor to a seat in the British House of Lords.)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Colley, Linda.

These two gods are now worshipped together under Ngewo, with Leve considered as his consort. Ngewo is a sky god, responsible for creating the universe, and is in charge of determining earth’s natural phenomena. He is popularly depicted as a distant deity, who does not concern himself with the day-to-day goings of his worshippers. However, in certain myths, Ngewo tends to punish those who forget to pray to him as well as those who do not pay tribute to him. He communicates with the Mende people through the help of their ancestors’ spirits, dyinyinga, who also demand certain food offerings.\n\nLegends\n\nCreation of the first human \nNgewo originally lived alone on earth in a cave. One day, he wanted company, so he started creating animals, in a female-male pair. Eventually, he created the first man and the first woman. Ngewo gave his creations freedom to ask him of anything, which backfired after a while. He was overwhelmed with their requests and retreated to the heavens, where he had lived since then.\n\nOrigin of death \nNgewo gave two messages to be received by the Mende people and told two animals, the toad and the dog, to send these messages to earth. The dog was entrusted with telling humans that they will not die, while the toad would bring a message foretelling their death instead. Unfortunately, the toad arrived first, since the dog was distracted. Thus, death became humanity’s fate.\n\nSee also \n\n List of African mythological figures\n\nReferences \n\nAfrican gods\nCreator deities\nAfrican mythology", "machine_text": " Ngewo is a traditional village in the Central Region of Ghana. It is located in the district of Mampong, about 40 kilometers north of the regional capital of Kumasi. The traditional rulers of Ngewo are the Oyoko Clan, the Oyokohene and Ankaasehene being the custodians of the land. Ngewo is home to more than 1000 people, who are mostly farmers and tradesmen. The main traditional crops cultivated in Ngewo are yams, maize, millet, and cassava. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly popular for crops such as cashew, peppers, and tomatoes to be grown in gardens and small farms. Fishing along the riverbanks is another source of income for many households in Ngewo. In keeping with tradition, Ngewo has a number of spiritual and ancestral sites including sacred groves and shrines. It is believed that ancestral spirits and good luck visit those who visit these sites, so people often come to pay their respects when blessings are needed. The people of Ngowo regard the traditional practice of “Kusaman” or “Kukyee” as important. When this ceremony is observed, spirits from the past are invited to return and dwell in the village for a time. In respect of its traditional practices, the government of Ghana has recognised Ngewo as an Eco-Village. This has also led to its designation as a tourism destination. Ngewo also serves as a centre for educational, agro-processing, and economic activities. The village has a primary school, Ngewo Primary, which caters to both the local children and those residing within neighbouring villages. Community work and agricultural extension programs have been organized by the government and non-governmental organizations to facilitate the expansion of local farms. The people of Ngewo have maintained their traditional practices while adapting to modern development and have worked to retain their culture through the establishment of craft sites where they make traditional crafts and baskets. Additionally, many of the villagers are actively involved in a number of cultural groups such as drumming, drumming and dance troupes, and traditional choral groups within the village. Ngewo has become an increasingly popular destination for tourists looking to experience traditional Ghanaian culture. Tourists can come to the village to observe the traditional practices, take part in local farming activities, and sample some of the locally produced food. They can also take part in cultural activities such as craft making, drumming, and storytelling around the fire. In recent years, Ngewo has become an important part of the Ghanaian national identity. Its role in preserving traditional practices and promoting economic development makes it an invaluable source of pride for the residents and an interesting destination for tourists looking to experience traditional culture.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 66855625}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jotabeche\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jotabeche is a Miocene-Pliocene caldera in the Atacama Region of Chile. It is part of the volcanic Andes, more specifically of the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). This sector of the Andean Volcanic Belt contains about 44 volcanic centres and numerous more minor volcanic systems, as well as some caldera and ignimbrite systems. Jotabeche is located in a now inactive segment of the CVZ, the Maricunga Belt.\n\nJotabeche formed from the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate, like the other volcanoes in the CVZ and the Andean Volcanic Belt. In the region of Jotabeche, during the late Miocene and Pliocene a change in the subduction geometry has caused volcanism to end, with volcanism shifting eastwards to the Incapillo volcanic centre. The crust beneath Jotabeche is  thick, which has had effects on the rock composition of the volcano.\n\nJotabeche has erupted two major ignimbrites between 8,500,000 and 5,900,000 years ago. The first ignimbrite was the larger one and is named Negro Francisco and the second is called Jotabeche proper. A caldera and some lava domes are also part of the complex. Volcanism ceased 5 million years ago.\n\nGeography and structure \nJotabeche is located at the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes. The Central Volcanic Zone is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. In this belt, ongoing subduction of the Antarctica plate, Nazca plate and its precursor the Farallon plate are responsible for ongoing volcanic activity, including such volcanoes as Villarrica and Nevado del Ruiz. The Central Volcanic Zone sub-belt itself contains about 44 volcanic centres and over five major Quaternary caldera and ignimbrite complexes. The so-called Abancay deflection separates the CVZ in the north from the Peruvian flat subduction segment where no volcanic activity occurs, while the southern limit is marked by a seismic discontinuity around 27° S.\n\nJotabeche is a  high volcano with a caldera. A rhyolitic dome formed inside of the caldera. The Jotabeche complex reaches a thickness of  when including ignimbrite, lava domes and lavas. The  high and  wide Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano is found northeast of Jotabeche and is surrounded by pyroclastic flows. The Santa Cecilia lava domes () have diameters of  and sit along a  long fault. The Miocene volcanic complex branches out in four chains stretching in east-west direction, the Cadillal, Aguas Blancas, Jotabeche Norte and Cordon de Yeguas Heladas. N-S to NE-SW trending faults border the volcanic complex and have allowed the intrusion of diorite porphyries. The resulting hydrothermally altered rocks are the sites of mineral deposits and prospects. These faults include the Yeguas Heladas, Rio La Gallina and Rio Astaburuaga and form a hexagonal structure which partly forms the margin of the caldera. Otherwise, only little erosion has taken place at Jotabeche; stronger erosion though has exposed a > thick hydrothermally altered complex at Aldebaran-Cerro Casale. Other hydrothermally altered areas are found within depressions. The crust beneath Jotabeche reaches a thickness of .\n\nGeology \nJotabeche is a volcanic centre in the 26-6 mya old and  long Maricunga belt. Some stratovolcanoes in the belt include Copiapó-Azufre, Cerros Bravos, Doña Inés, La Laguna, Lagunillas, Ojos del Maricunga, Santa Rosa and Cadillal-Yeguas Heladas. Volcanic activity in this belt has also generated porphyry deposits containing silver, gold and copper. This belt is bordered by graben and horst tectonic structures that have generated the Salar de Maricunga and the Laguna de Negro Francisco.\n\nJotabeche is located at the southern end of the Maricunga belt, which was active starting from the Oligocene until the Pliocene. The formation of this volcanic belt was influenced by the changes in the subduction of the Nazca plate, which included the shallowing of the subducting plate and the formation of the Puna plateau. Jotabeche, belonging to the fourth stage of Maricunga belt activity after the third stage of Copiapo, is the youngest eruption of the Maricunga belt, whose activity ended with the Jotabeche caldera forming eruption. Volcanism afterwards shifted eastwards. Jotabeche is one of the largest volcanoes in the Maricunga belt. Volcanic activity at Jotabeche is coeval with the last mineralization phase of the Vallecito system in the El Indio belt.\n\nLocal \nJotabeche is part of the so-called Cordillera de Darwin segment of the Andes. The basement in the area consists of various sedimentary-volcanic formations dating back to the Paleozoic Chinches formation but also including the Jurassic Lautaro formation and the Cretaceous Quebrada de Monardes formation. Of the volcanic formations, the Pantanoso rhyolitic formation of the Paleozoic and the thick andesitic-dacitic lava flows of the mesozoic Rio Aguas Blancas formation are the most important. During the Cretaceous, local extension formed a number of small faults in the area. The oldest of these sequences crops out east of Jotabeche at the Chilean-Argentine frontier.\n\nComposition \nJotabeche has generated rhyodacite rocks. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite is rhyolitic while the Jotabeche ignimbrite itself is of rhyodacitic composition. Specific  concentrations are 65–70% for Negro Francisco while the caldera complex has 68–72%. The Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano has a concentration of 60% and is considered to be hornblende andesite in terms of composition. Overall, all rocks fit the potassium-rich calc alkaline pattern. Gold-rich porphyry deposits are found on Jotabeche's flanks. Diorites are also found but the only weak erosion and thick late Miocene rock cover bury them. Other mineralizations are found between Jotabeche and the Salar de Maricunga.\n\nThe chemistry of Jotabeche ignimbrites is distinct from other Tertiary volcanic rocks in the Andes. The rocks of Jotabeche have lanthanum, strontium and yttrium concentrations which fit an eclogitic trend, similar to other Andean volcanoes Pircas Negras, Tortolas and Vallecito. More generally, the geochemistry is indicative of the volcanic activity being influenced both by a thick crust and other factors of crustal contamination. Other composition data are indicative of a drop in mantle water content above the shallowing slab. The crust above the Jotabeche ignimbrite source region was thick enough to permit the stability of garnet in said source region.\n\nGlaciation \nJotabeche does not currently display any perennial snow, only during summer is snow observed in the area. Likewise, rock glaciers are only found as fossil remnants. However, moraines are found at Jotabeche, and glaciers advanced north from a cirque on its northern flank into the Laguna de Negro Francisco, where a peninsula marks the position of the most extensive moraine.\n\nEruptive history \nJotabeche was active between 7 and 5 mya ago, spanning the late Miocene and Pliocene. The end of volcanic activity at Jotabeche occurred at the same time as the northeastern arm of the Juan Fernandez ridge passed beneath the volcano. After end of activity at Jotabeche volcanism occurred farther east at Incapillo. 15.3 ± 0.8 and 17.2 ± 0.7 mya the Las Gallinas ignimbrite formed east of Jotabeche, but its origin is unknown.\n\nThe Santa Cecilia domes of Jotabeche were active 24.3 ± 0.7 mya and 24.1 ± 0.8 mya based on potassium-argon dating of an eroded tuff ring. Between 18 and 16 mya the Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano was active in the region. Some rhyolitic lava domes intruded into the caldera are 10 mya old. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted 8.5 mya ago and covers a surface area of  around the Laguna del Negro Francisco; it is the initial activity of Jotabeche. 5.9–6.2 mya the Jotabeche ignimbrite covered a surface area of . The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted from a NW-trending fault and flowed between the Jotabeche Norte and La Laguna stratovolcanoes to the Laguna del Negro Francisco depression and across it. The so-called Pircas Negras andesitic lava flows occur at the same time as the younger Jotabeche activity. Andesitic-dacitic lava domes along the La Gallina fault are of the same age.\n\nAt Copiapo and Jotabeche, the volcanic activity has been subdivided in three phases, the first being the \"normal\" volcanic phase, a second phase with a drop in magma supply and the formation of more differentiated magmas in crustal magma chambers such as rhyolites and at the end the eruption of andesites along fractures. Other volcanoes in the Maricunga belt display different evolutionary processes, probably because of a lesser tectonic influence.\n\nArcheology \nResearch performed on Jotabeche in the 1980s demonstrated the existence of a shrine on Jotabeche. People probably climbed the mountain to use it during the southern summer months. Archeological sites in the region are not unknown: Copiapo, Incahuasi, Pastillitos and Los Patos also have archeological sites.\n\nSee also \n\n Ojos de Maricunga\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nSergio Gamonal 2015, Volcanic stratigraphy and epithermal mineralization of the La Coipa district, Maricunga belt, Chile\nAlexander Brenning 2005, Climatic and geomorphological controls of rock glaciers in the Andes of Central Chile – combining statistical modelling and field mapping\n\nMiocene volcanoes\nCalderas of Chile\nPliocene volcanoes\nVolcanoes of Atacama Region", "machine_text": " Jotabeche is a Chilean municipality located in the commune of Maipo, Santiago Metropolitan Region.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vernon Prichard\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vernon Edwin \"Prich\" Prichard (January 25, 1892 – July 10, 1949) was an American football quarterback and United States Army officer. He played college football with Army and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1914. He became a career officer in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of major general. He was lifelong friends with West Point classmate Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower and, during World War II, he commanded the 14th Armored Division in the United States from 1942 to 1944 and the 1st Armored Division from 1944 to 1945 during the Italian Campaign.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Onawa, Iowa, Prichard was the son of attorney J.A. Prichard.  The younger Prichard began his education at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he also played football and established a reputation as a passer.  In November 1910, while he was a student at Morningside, Prichard received word that he had been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.  He enrolled at West Point on June 11, 1911.\n\nU.S. Military Academy\nWhile serving as a cadet at West Point, Prichard played for the Academy's football and baseball teams.  He gained his greatest fame in football as the quarterback for the Army Black Knights football team from 1912 to 1914.  Prichard's teammates on the Army football teams included two of the leading generals of World War II, Omar Bradley, who played at the end position, and Dwight Eisenhower, who played halfback until a knee injury sidelined him.  James Van Fleet, commander of U.S. forces in the Korean War, also played on the 1914 West Point football team with Prichard.  Although he weighed only 158 pounds, Prichard played every minute of every major game during his three years of varsity football at West Point.\n\nPrichard first gained national attention after an October 1913 game against Colgate University.  Colgate led 6–0 with ten seconds left to play, when Prichard sprinted 70 yards for a touchdown to lead Army to a 7–6 victory.\n\nThroughout his football career at West Point, Prichard's favorite receiver was Louis A. Merrilat from Chicago.  The passing team of \"Prichard to Merrilat\" was one of the first great passing combinations in college football.  The Prichard-Merrilat combination gained national fame after the 1913 Army–Navy Game, played in New York before a crowd of 40,000 at the Polo Grounds.  Army had not defeated Navy since 1905, and Navy was undefeated and favored to beat Army by odds of 6–1.  Although Navy had allowed only seven points in its other games in 1913, Prichard and Merrilat teamed up to lead Army to a 22–9 win, with Prichard throwing two touchdown passes to Merrilat. The crowd reportedly left the Polo Grounds chanting, \"Prichard-to-Merillat, Prichard-to-Merillat ...\"\nover and over again.\n\nOn the train trip back to West Point after the 1913 Navy game, the football team elected Prichard as the captain of the 1914 football team.  A newspaper report announcing his election noted:\n\nThe football squad elected its next year's captain on the train trip home.  They chose Cadet Vernon E. Prichard of the second class as their leader.  Cadet Prichard has played quarterback on the team for two seasons and got in every game except one on the army's schedule this season.  His brilliant forward passing, spectacular open field running and excellent generalship have made him one of the season's leading quarterbacks. ... His election was unanimous.  He is a color sergeant in the cadet battalion and popular with his teammates and fellow cadets.\n\nIn 1914, Prichard led Army to an undefeated 9–0 season.  In the final game of the season, Army defeated Navy, 20–0, as Prichard finished his college football career by throwing passes to Merrilat and Bob Neyland, who later became the football coach at the University of Tennessee.  At the end of the season, Prichard was selected as a first-team All-American quarterback.\n\nAt West Point, Prichard was known to his fellow cadets by the nicknames \"Prich\" and \"Nigger\".  A profile of Prichard in a West Point yearbook noted:\n\nIt's hard to tell the truth about Prich for no one knows just what it is. Some move him right up beside St. Peter and hand him a 'New Model Harp' with printed directions for playing, while others give him a dog's name and call him Nigger.  But wherever you rank him, it's a safe bet that he'll feel right at home.  He'll borrow his Satanic Majesty's opera cloak for the first night or slap the old Saint on the back and ask him for Bull and papers.\"\n\nMilitary career\n\nEarly years\nUpon graduating from the Academy in June 1915, Prichard received the rank of second lieutenant and was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. He served at Eagle Pass, Texas, from September 1915 to April 1916 and participated in the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico from April to August 1916. While serving in Mexico, Prichard was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Prichard returned to West Point for temporary duty during the fall of 1916 but returned to Mexico from December through February 1917.\n\nWorld War I\nIn May 1917, a month following the American entry into World War I, Prichard was promoted to the rank of captain of the Infantry Branch. He sailed for the Western Front via England on January 8, 1918. He entered Germany with the Army of Occupation via Belgium and Luxembourg and served in Germany and France through June 1919.\n\nWorld War II\nPrichard remained lifelong friends with his backfield partner, Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower. Eisenhower later recalled that he looked for \"natural leaders\" from the ranks of football. Eisenhower believed that football, more than any other sport, instilled the belief that victory comes from teamwork and dedication. He identified Prichard as one of the officers with football background who had \"measured up\" during the war.\n\nChoosing to remain in the army in the period between the wars, during World War II, Prichard served as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 27th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940–41. He served as chief of staff of the 4th Armored Division from 1941–42 and as Commanding General (CG) of the 14th Armored Division from November 1942 until July 1944. From July 1944 until September 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was the CG of the 1st \"Old Ironsides\" Armored Division during the Italian Campaign, including the Battle of the Gothic Line, Po Valley and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.\n\nPrichard and Eisenhower exchanged correspondence during the war.  Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower wrote a letter to Prichard in which he confided \"this is a long tough road we have to travel.\" In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that \"men that can do things are going to be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning,\" and \"fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered.\"\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, Prichard wrote to Eisenhower, reminding him of what their football coach had taught them: \"If things break badly or go against you -- stay with it all the harder.\" Eisenhower's biographer, Matthew Holland, later wrote that Eisenhower had learned important lessons on the football playing field at West Point, and concluded: \"World War II was won on the playing fields of West Point, and Ike would prove to be the quarterback of the winning team.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Prichard became the Chief of the Army Public Information Division. In February 1949, President Harry S. Truman promoted Prichard from the rank of brigadier general to major general.\n\nDeath and funeral\nPrichard was killed in a yacht explosion in July 1949.  He was part of a group that had boarded the yacht Halcyon for a picnic cruise on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.  The craft was within yards of the dock at the Corinthian Yacht Club when an explosion destroyed the vessel.  Prichard was thrown into the Potomac and killed instantly.  Navy Commodore Wilfred Painter was also killed in the blast.  Philadelphia soldier, diplomat and socialite Col. Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. dove into the Potomac in an effort to save Prichard and recovered his body.\n\nPrichard's funeral was held at the chapel of Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.  The Army's chief of chaplains officiated at the funeral, and the honorary pallbearers included Secretary of the Army, Gordon Gray, and classmates from the West Point Class of 1915, including Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nDecorations\nHere is the ribbon bar of Major General Prichard:\n\nSee also\n1914 College Football All-America Team\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGenerals of World War II\n\n|-\n\n1892 births\n1949 deaths\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nArmy Black Knights baseball players\nArmy Black Knights football players\nMorningside Mustangs football players\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army Command and General Staff College alumni\nRecipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)\nRecipients of the Legion of Merit\nOfficiers of the Légion d'honneur\nRecipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France)\nRecipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross\nBurials at Arlington National Cemetery\nPeople from Monona County, Iowa\nGraduates of the United States Military Academy Class of 1915\nUnited States Army personnel of World War I\nUnited States Army generals of World War II\nMilitary personnel from Iowa", "machine_text": " Vernon Prichard (1876-1944) was an American-Canadian industrial worker who is best remembered for his inventiveness in the area of torque measuring devices. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876, Prichard moved to Ontario, Canada in 1916. Prichard worked at various factories as a manual laborer during his time in Ontario. It was during this time that he became inspired to invent something related to measuring torque. Between 1916 and 1918, he had developed several prototype devices which he sold to local machine shops. Prichard's most successful invention was the \"Prichard Torque Meter,\" which was capable of measuring torque in both metric and imperial systems. This device was the first of its kind and was used in factories and machine shops across North America. The design of the meter was quite simple. It features a large base which is filled with a measured amount of oil, a spring-loaded piston, and a dial which is calibrated to measure torque in either metric or imperial units. It also had a pressure gauge which allowed the user to measure and control the pressure at which the spring-loaded piston operated. This made it a very accurate and reliable device. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Prichard sold the device to various companies, and his success as an inventor made him a well-known figure in Ontario. Eventually, he received several patents for his inventions, including one for the Torque Meter. After his death in 1944, his sons continued to manufacture the device, and it is still in production today. The work of Vernon Prichard is an important example of how a humble manual laborer can use his knowledge and resourcefulness to develop something which has become an important tool for industrial manufacturing.

The brick townhouse, built c. 1806, is notable as the home for many years of Charles Sumner (1811–1874), an outspoken and aggressive political opponent of slavery, whose beating on the floor of the United States Senate in 1856 was a defining moment of the pre-American Civil War period. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Sumner is a four-story townhouse, faced in brick, which was built c. 1806. The interior has a typical side hall plan, with a front parlor, behind which are a sitting room and kitchen. Its upper floors have similar arrangements of rooms. The house was Charles Sumner's home for thirty years.\n\nCharles Sumner was born to abolitionist parents, and was educated at Harvard College, where he studied law under Joseph Story. Sumner became politically active in the fight against slavery in the 1840s, when he also gained a reputation as an orator. He helped found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848, under whose banner he won election to the United States Senate in 1851. This marked the beginning of a more vocal and aggressive opposition to slavery in the political halls of Washington, D.C. His searing verbal reprobation of his opponents escalated into violence when he was beaten unconscious on the floor of the Senate by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in 1856, an event that emotionally polarized the country. After Sumner's recovery, he returned to the Senate, where he played a leading role as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War, as an advocate of emancipation. After the war he championed civil rights for free slaves during the Reconstruction Era, and played a role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nThe house was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nImages\n\nSee also\n List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston\n National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nHouses completed in 1806\nNational Historic Landmarks in Boston\nHouses in Boston\nBeacon Hill, Boston\nHistoric district contributing properties in Massachusetts\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Suffolk County, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places in Boston\nSumner family", "machine_text": " Charles Sumner House, also known as The Charles Sumner School Museum and Archives, is a historic residence located in Washington, D.C. The house was built in 1792 and was home to Senator Charles Sumner (1811-1875) from 1859-1874. A prominent politician, Sumner championed civil rights in the Reconstruction Congress, served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and was a leader of the anti-slavery movement. Sumner was also a staunch advocate of women’s rights and African American equality. The house, located at 17th Street and M Street in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of northwest Washington, D.C., is now a museum of African and African-American history. The museum offers guided tours and exhibits, including artifacts from the Sumner era and the African Diaspora. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It was also designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. The house has a Victorian Italianate-style architecture, with many of its original features still intact, such as the porch, original moldings, columns, and marble mantels. The interior of the house is a mix of Victorian and antique styles of furniture and décor. Much of the furniture dates from the period when Sumner lived in it, and it has been used as the background for many film and television productions. The house contains art and artifacts related to the history of African-Americans and the African Diaspora, including artwork, documents, and photographs. The museum also includes a full-scale replica of Sumner’s study and a reference library. Visitors to the museum can learn about Sumner’s life, his work as an abolitionist, his dedication to civil and women’s rights, and the African diaspora. The Charles Sumner House also hosts numerous events and programs, such as lectures, workshops, and presentations on the history and culture of African-Americans. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and admission is free. Special tours are available for groups and school classes.

The actual amount of the scholarship is determined based upon state funding and is sometimes less than the maximum amount.  From June 2004 to July 2005, 8390 students were enrolled in the Bright Flight program, which totaled over $15 million in state expenditures.\n\nQualifications and renewal\nTo qualify for the Bright Flight maximum award of $3000 per year, a student must be in the top 3% of his or her statewide high school class as determined by normalized tests, the ACT and SAT composite scores. To date and for several years, a score of 31 or above on the ACT or an SAT-equivalent score qualifies, but the score can change each year.  A composite score of 31 will be needed to qualify for the college freshmen in the 2020–2021 school year.\nThe law also qualifies students in the 4th and 5th percentiles to receive a $1000 per year maximum scholarship; however, the Missouri Legislature has not funded this award in recent years, and these students have received no actual financial award.  An ACT composite score of 30 (or above) qualified for the 4th and 5th percentile for college freshmen in the 2020–2021 school year and recent years.\nTo continue receiving the scholarship, students must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA in college and maintain full-time student status to renew the scholarship, which can be renewed for up to five years.\nStudents must not be pursuing a degree in theology or divinity.  \nBright Flight students must attend school continuously.  They cannot cease attending school, except to work for a non-profit organization, hold a government job, or serve in the armed services. Academic interruption must not exceed 27 months.\n\nHistory\nAppropriated by the Missouri General Assembly in 1986, students initially received a statutory maximum of $2000 per year.  Many students and higher education officials have observed that tuition expenses at the University of Missouri, for example, were below $2000 in 1987 and thus were fully covered by Bright Flight at its introduction. In 2017, following a period of increases in tuition expenses that easily outpaced inflation, Bright Flight covered only a fraction of the more than $11,000 a typical student spent on tuition at the University of Missouri.\n\nRecent developments\n\nOn August 12, 2010, state budget cuts reduced the amount from $2000/year to $1500/year for that year.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced at a college preparatory school in Kansas City, Missouri that he included a proposal in Missouri's 2015 budget that would offer an option to receive up to $5,000 extra per year if recipients stayed in Missouri after finishing college for the number of years they received Bright Flight.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Universities in Missouri received an email from the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development that noted, “The General Assembly appropriated $20,176,666 in Bright Flight funds for state fiscal year 2021.  However, based on current economic conditions the Governor has restricted almost $6.5 million of those funds, significantly reducing the amount of funds available to the program.  As a result, the estimated Bright Flight award amounts have been reduced from $3,000 to $1,800 to ensure expenditures do not exceed the available funds.  We regret the impact this unavoidable reduction will have on students and we will consider a mid-year increase to award amounts if the restricted funds are released. Final award amounts for both programs will be announced in August.”  This email reflected the budget cuts indicated by the Governor in the previous month.\n\nReferences  \n\nEducation in Missouri\nScholarships in the United States\nPublic education in Missouri\nGovernment scholarships", "machine_text": " Bright Flight (Missouri scholarship) is an academic merit-based scholarship opportunity being offered by the State of Missouri. It’s designed to recognize and reward high achieving high school graduates in the state of Missouri. The award seeks to encourage those students who have achieved a high level of academic achievement to pursue their educational pursuits in the state’s higher education institutions. The scholarship program is administered by the Missouri Department of Higher Education. It’s funded by the State’s General Assembly, with awards every year since 1992. The award is also available to home-schooled students and students enrolling as freshmen in qualifying higher education institutions. The amount of the award varies annually but it’s typically between $2,500 and $3,000 per year. The award is renewable for up to four years, depending on the student’s academic performance at the collegiate level. In order to qualify for the Bright Flight award, students must first demonstrate a level of academic excellence by taking the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) or the American College Test (ACT). Those students who meet the score requirements are then eligible to receive the award. In addition, the student must have been a resident of Missouri for at least one year prior to being awarded the scholarship and be a current resident of Missouri at the time of enrollment in a qualifying higher education institution. The student must also meet certain eligibility requirements as determined by the Missouri Department of Higher Education. The Bright Flight award is intended to provide qualified students with the financial resources needed to pursue their educational goals in the higher education institutions of the state of Missouri. It may also provide an additional incentive for the student to strive for academic excellence and ensure a bright future for those individuals. The award is intended to encourage even greater academic achievement and encourage students to strive for excellence in the areas of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Bright Flight scholarships may also provide an incentive for students from low-income backgrounds or backgrounds of economic disadvantage to strive for a higher level of education attainment. By providing financial support to students who might otherwise not be able to pursue higher education, the scholarship honors their commitment to academic excellence and provides opportunities to students who might otherwise not be able to participate in higher education. The application process typically begins in the springtime, typically around April or May. Students who believe they may be eligible for the award should contact the Financial Aid office at their respective higher education institution for more information.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3860432}

He was, most recently, Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of Government at Georgetown University.  He retired from teaching in December 2012, giving his final lecture on December 7, 2012, at Georgetown;  it was entitled \"The Final Gladness,\" and was sponsored by the Tocqueville Forum. Of his many publications his book Another Sort of Learning (\"a reflection on different aspects of lifelong learning\") has been hailed as exceptional.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Pocahontas, Iowa, and educated in local public schools, he graduated from Knoxville (Iowa) High School in 1945.\n\nAfter time in the U.S. Army (1946–47), he joined the Society of Jesus (California Province) in 1948, and then attended Santa Clara University in California.  He earned an MA in Philosophy from Gonzaga University in 1955. He earned a PhD in Political Theory from Georgetown University in 1960, and was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1963.  In 1964, he earned an M.A. in Sacred Theology from Santa Clara University.\n\nFr. Schall was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Social Sciences, Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, from 1964 to 1977, and a member of the Government Department, University of San Francisco, from 1968 to 1977. Among the sources for Schall's lectures were Christian Scripture, Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, G.K. Chesterton, and Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nBefore retiring, he had been a member of the Government Department at Georgetown University since 1977.  In 1993, 2004 and 2010, Fr. Schall was presented the Edward B. Bunn, SJ, Award for Faculty Excellence by the senior class in the College of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University.\n\nSchall retired from his position at Georgetown in December 2012 and moved into the Jesuit retirement home in Los Gatos, California  (on the same property as the location of his old novitiate) where he continued to write books and articles for publications and websites. He also continued to give presentations to small groups on request.\n\nSchall served as a member of the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace, in Rome from 1977 to 1982. He was also a member of the National Council of the Humanities, and a member of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1984 to 1990.\n\nA prolific writer, he wrote more than 30 books and edited or co-edited 8 others.  By July 2002, his website listed his authorship of 356 essays, 148 book reviews, and 660 columns, including his monthly column, \"Sense and Nonsense,\" for the Catholic journal Crisis, and his columns in Gilbert! magazine, the Saint Austin Review, and the University Bookman.\n\nFr. Schall was an expert on the thought of G. K. Chesterton; he edited two volumes of Chesterton's collected works and wrote his own volume of essays on the famous Catholic convert.\n\nSchall was a vigorous supporter of Benedict XVI's critique of western culture which categorizes it as a \"dictatorship of relativism\".  Schall taught that Catholicism is where \"Revelation is addressed to reason\" and stated that \"We are living in a time where the logic of disorder is at work, rejecting systematically the logic of being a human being.\" Schall stated that the societal re-examination of the definition of the family \"is not just an accident,\" but is the culture \"rejecting heavenly answers and replacing them with human answers. A will is leading you, and it says there is something wrong with being human. That goes back to the whole drama of the Fall. C.S. Lewis says the ultimate sin, the ultimate disorder, is to say what is good is bad, what is bad is good.\"  A reporter summed up his statements as \"If we [in society] reject the intelligibility and goodness of creation, will we still be able to hear God’s voice calling us to our supernatural end?\"\n\nMedical issues\nSchall survived a few major illnesses, including one that resulted in the loss of function in one of his eyes. In the summer of 2010 he had a cancerous jawbone and its attached teeth removed and replaced with bone taken from his leg.\n\nWritings (selection)\n\nBooks\nReason, Revelation, and the Foundations of Political Philosophy (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1967)  \nRedeeming the Time (New York: Sheed & Ward, 1968)  LC 68-13845  ASIN: B0006BUD2I\nHuman Dignity and Human Numbers (Staten Island, NY: Alba House, 1971)  \nPlay On: From Games to Celebrations (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971)  \nThe Sixth Paul (Canfield, OH: Alba Books, 1977)  \nWelcome, number 4,000,000,000!

In 1952, Schall entered the Society of Jesus, where he studied at the Jesuit seminary St. Andrew’s Hall at Gonzaga and in 1955 was ordained a priest. He earned a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University in political science. Schall taught political philosophy at Georgetown for thirty-five years, retiring in 1995, and is known especially for his work on classical political philosophy. His books include The Mind That is Catholic (1984), Another Sort of Learning (1988), On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs (1994), The Regensburg Lecture (2003), and A Student’s Guide to Liberal Learning (2004). Schall's works range widely over many areas and topics, such as reflections on the nature of liberal learning, discussions of the relationship between politics and morality, as well as studies of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Edmund Burke, and John Courtney Murray, among others. Despite his vast knowledge of different minds, he opted for wide-ranging criticism of his modern age, instead of providing new positive doctrine. Schall was a consultant to the United States Department of State and a consultant to the 1995 Synod of Bishops of the Catholic Church, and was a member of the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He wrote on topics including the nature of liberal learning, philosophy of science, theological aesthetics, ancient and modern political philosophy, transnationalism and international relations, and globalisation and the loss of cultural identity. Along with his academic works, Father Schall served the Society of Jesus and the Roman Catholic Church. He received The Roman Award of the Order of St. Sylvester in 2005, conferred by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Father Schall published fourteen books and over nine hundred articles in a variety of scholarly journals. He resided at the Jesuit Community of Georgetown University until his death on April 26, 2020.
