{"id": "Eban Goodstein", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eban%20Goodstein", "title": "Eban Goodstein", "text": "Eban Goodstein (born 1960) is an economist, author, and public educator who directs both the Center for Environmental Policy and the MBA in Sustainability at Bard College.  He is known for organizing national educational initiatives on climate change, which have engaged thousands of schools and universities, civic institutions, faith groups, and community organizations in solutions-driven dialogue. He is the author of three books and numerous journal articles. He and his wife, Chungin Chung Goodstein, live in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. They have three daughters.\n\nEarly life and education\nGoodstein was born and grew up in Sewanee, Tennessee. His parents were affiliated with the Highlander Research and Education Center, a networking and skills-training institute that facilitates grassroots organizing for issues of social and environmental justice throughout Appalachia and the South. In partnership with several other families, his parents helped drive the desegregation of the local Franklin County public school system in 1962, (one of 17 school districts in Tennessee still under court orders to unify their desegregated student bodies).\n\nGoodstein received his B.A. from Williams College, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nAcademic career\nGoodstein was a professor of economics at Skidmore College and Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon. In 2009 he relocated to Bard College to Direct the Center for Environmental Policy. His research centers on environmental and natural resource economics, the relationship between jobs and environmental policy, and climate economics. \nAt Bard CEP, Goodstein launched one of the nation’s first MS in Climate Science and Policy degree offerings. In 2012, with the support of Hunter Lovins, Goodstein also founded Bard’s MBA in Sustainability —one of a handful of programs globally that fully integrates sustainability into a core graduate business curriculum.\n\nGoodstein was a writer-in-residence at the Mesa Refuge Writers' Retreat, is on the steering committee of Economics for Equity and the Environment Network (E3), and the Editorial Board of Sustainability: The Journal of Record. He also serves on the Board of the Follett Corporation.\n\nClimate education\nIn 1999, Goodstein founded the Green House Network, an organization dedicated to supporting the clean energy movement. As the volunteer Executive Director of the organization, Goodstein led a series of weekend training workshops in grassroots organization and outreach, based in part on the techniques and principles of the Highlander Center, training over 600 volunteer educators. Goodstein also set up a national speakers’ bureau of climate, energy policy, and environmental experts, preceding Vice-President Al Gore's Climate Project speaker-training initiative.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Goodstein worked with Matthew Follett to produce the Race to Stop Global Warming, a 10K non-competitive footrace that involved thousands of runners and their families in eight cities across the United States. These efforts earned the Green House Network the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s \"Climate Saver's Award\".\n\nIn the winter of 2006, a rising sense of personal urgency about the need for action led Goodstein to expand the scale of his work, and launch the first of the national teach-in initiatives, Focus the Nation. Goodstein, with his wife and the project Communications Director, Chungin Chung, spent eighteen months traveling across the country, speaking and organizing on over 150 campuses. In January 2008, over 1900 universities, schools, and civic groups nationwide participated in what amounted to one of the largest teach-in in U.S. history, involving over a million people in an event designed to educate and engage Americans in a discussion of global warming solutions. Goodstein and Chung organized a second teach-in in  2009.\n\nAt Bard, Goodstein initiated and directs the C2C Fellows Program —a national network of undergraduates and recent graduates who aspire to sustainability leadership in business and politics. C2C Fellows runs weekend skills training workshops across the country, helping young people develop paths to leadership careers from which they can make a difference in the world, while in their 20s.\n\nWriting\nGoodstein's writing has appeared in a number of journals, and his research has been featured in The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Economist, The New York Times, Scientific American, Time, and USA Today.  He is the author of a college textbook, Economics and the Environment now in its 7th edition, as well as The Trade-off Myth: Fact and Fiction about Jobs and the Environment. His most recent book is Fighting for Love in the Century of Extinction: How Passion and Politics Can Stop Global Warming,.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Organizational Videos on YouTube\n\nPeople from Sewanee, Tennessee\nWriters from Portland, Oregon\nWilliams College alumni\nUniversity of Michigan alumni\n1960 births\nLiving people\nLewis & Clark College faculty\nAmerican environmentalists\nClimate activists", "machine_abstract": "Eban Goodstein (born March 16, 1966) is the founder and CEO of The Eban Group LLC., which he founded in 2002 after leaving his position as President & COO at American Express Company.

They just couldn't get enough\".\n\n\"the young violinist captivates with his sensitive attention to detail - and a charmingly youthful sense of kitsch-free, authentic romance.\"\n\n\"Isaac Stern couldn’t have wished for a brighter spotlight.  If Widjaja has been received  as a sort of pop star, then he’s succeeded on a even higher level in bringing rich musical values to the marketplace than have, say, Nigel Kennedy and David Garrett. His versions of Bach sound like no others. He weds strong timbral individuality to comprehensive technical command and deep musical insight. Urgently recommended! A young violinist, synthesizing much of value from the past with much of value from the present. Intensely interesting—and riveting\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n \n Filmporträt von brainworkers & more\n Iskandar Widjaja bei YOUTUBE\n Iskandar Widjaja: Pulling all the Right Strings, Article in the Jakarta Post dated 9 June 2013\n Iskandar Widjaja: Künstler nicht in Schubladen stecken\n\nGerman classical violinists\nMale classical violinists\n1986 births\nLiving people\nMusicians from Berlin", "machine_abstract": "Iskandar Widjaja (born September 8, 1953) is the son of Indonesian tycoon Robert Kuok and younger brother to Victor Liem.

In May 2021, it was announced that Don't Be Tardy had been canceled after eight seasons.\n\nBackground\nDon't Be Tardy follows the daily lives of Kim Zolciak, her husband, Kroy Biermann, and their family. The first season was titled Don't Be Tardy for the Wedding, which documented the couple as they prepared for their wedding, as well as the wedding day itself. In November 2012, the series was renewed for a second season, with the series being renamed to its current title. Season 2 premiered on April 16, 2013. The second season encompasses Zolciak as she moves on from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, takes care of her family, constructs her dream home, and manages to live out of the townhouse with the couple's growing family.\n\nKroy met Kim Zolciak in May 2010 while Zolciak was attending the Dancing Stars of Atlanta charity event to support fellow Real Housewives cast member, Sheree Whitfield. Biermann and  Zolciak started dating and, just three months later, Zolciak was pregnant. On May 31, 2011, Zolciak gave birth to son Kroy Jagger Biermann Jr. This was Biermann's first child and Kim's first son. The couple wed at their previous Atlanta home on November 11, 2011. On March 20, 2012 Kim announced via Twitter that she and Kroy were expecting their second child together. On August 15, 2012, they welcomed their second son, Kash Kade Biermann. It was announced on June 5, 2013, that the couple was expecting their third child together. It was then announced on August 19, 2013, that the couple was expecting a set of twins; the twins are the couples' third and fourth children - Zolciak's fifth and sixth. Zolciak announced that she gave birth to her twins on November 25, 2013. The girl is named Kaia Rose after one of Kroy's nieces, Kiah, and \"Psychic Rose\" - who Kim is seen visiting throughout her time on The Real Housewives - while her boy, Kane Ren, includes Ren after Zolciak's OBGYN who has delivered 5 out of her 6 children. Rose died on June 5, 2021.\n\nBravo announced the third season renewal of Don't Be Tardy in April 2014. Season 3 premiered on July 17, 2014. The third season features Kim and Kroy's two new twins (a boy and a girl), their first two children together (both boys), and their two teenagers (adopted by Kroy but fathered in previous relationships of Kim's). The four younger children are all under the age of four. Kroy dealt with a football injury that temporarily suspended his football career. The family has moved into their completed 6,500 square-foot home.\n\nIn March 2015, Bravo renewed Don't Be Tardy for a fourth season, which premiered on August 16, 2015 In April 2016, the show was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on September 14, 2016.

{"id": "Pacheco Creek (San Benito County)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacheco%20Creek%20%28San%20Benito%20County%29", "title": "Pacheco Creek (San Benito County)", "text": "Pacheco Creek is a  west by southwest flowing stream which heads in the Diablo Range in southeastern Santa Clara County and flows to San Felipe Lake, the beginning of the Pajaro River mainstem, in San Benito County, California.\n\nHistory\nThe creek is named for Francisco Pacheco and Juan P. Pacheco who were granted the Rancho Ausaymas y San Felipe land grants in 1833 and 1836, and 1843 respectively. An early name for the creek was Arroyo de San Felipe. Francisco Pacheco came to California in 1819. \n\nJust north of the earthen dam on North Fork Pacheco Creek was one of the last refuges of the Amah-Mutsun band of the Ohlone people, and is rich archeologically with multiple burial sites and artifacts, including projective points so large that they would have been used for bear or elk.  In 1993, Mark Hylkema documented eight different Native American sites in this area, dating from 1000 B.C. to 500 A.D.\n\nFlooding\nOn 11 January 2017, a levee break at Pacheco Creek affected fifty local homes; some homes had mudlines about five feet high. On 12 January, health officials advised some local residents not to drink local tapwater pending contamination testing.\n\nWatershed\nThe mainstem Pacheco Creek is formed by the confluence of the North Fork Pacheco Creek and South Fork Pacheco Creek about  west of Pacheco Pass. Significant flows are contributed to the Pacheco Creek mainstem by the North and South Forks of Pacheco Creek, and Cedar Creek. \n\nThe North Fork Pacheco Creek tributary is a  stream beginning in Henry W. Coe State Park at  and receives the  East Fork Pacheco Creek, at Chimney Rock before reaching Pacheco Reservoir, the latter just north of Highway 152 and  above the confluence of North and South Forks Pacheco Creek. The Mississippi Creek tributary of North Fork Pacheco Creek is  has an impoundment (Mississippi Lake) above  elevation, and sources on Bear Mountain on the northern side of Henry W. Coe State Park.\n\nThe South Fork Pacheco Creek tributary receives flows from the shorter Middle Fork Pacheco Creek just below Highway 152. From here the South Fork Pacheco Creek flows  to it confluence with North Fork Pacheco Creek, forming the source of the Pacheco Creek mainstem. From here Pacheco Creek generally follows Highway 152, passing from Santa Clara County to San Benito County, and continuing until it empties into San Felipe (Soap) Lake, the source of the Pajaro River.\n\nTequisquita Slough joins Pacheco Creek just above San Felipe Lake. The latter has 3 main tributaries, Santa Ana Creek, Arroyo de Los Viboras, and Arroyo Dos Pichachos. Santa Ana Creek is apparently named for the Rancho Santa Ana y Quien Sabe land grant.\n\nStream flow in Pacheco Creek is influenced by releases from the North Fork Pacheco Reservoir, which is operated by the Pacheco Pass Water District.\n\nEcology\nSignificant remnants of the historic riparian California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) habitat still exists on Pacheco Creek and are a good example of the Central Coast Sycamore Alluvial Woodland habitat type.\n\nPacheco Creek historically hosted steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as evidenced by a physical specimen collected in 1945 by D.H. Simpson in the California Academy of Sciences, \"19.5 miles east of Gilroy on Hwy. 152\". Cedar Creek and South Fork Pacheco Creek hosted steelhead trout runs in wet years and juveniles found on stream sampling indicated the presence of perennial pools suitable for oversummering in headwater reaches. Pacheco Reservoir (North Fork Dam) is an impassable barrier to in-migrating steelhead trout, preventing access to the nearly  of stream consisting of North Fork Pacheco Creek, Mississippi Creek and East Fork Pacheco Creek. In 1973 Fish and Game Warden W. I. Donahue reported that \"high quality spawning and rearing habitat with perennial flow occurred upstream from Pacheco Dam on the North Fork, but was unavailable to steelhead because of the dam.\" In addition, resident rainbow (the landlocked form of steelhead trout) successfully rear in fast-water habitats grow rapidly and reach smolt size by the end of their first summer. In many years in late spring, prior to reservoir releases for agriculture, low stream flows and high water temperatures severely impact steelhead fry and small juveniles. \n\nOther native fish in Pacheco Creek include Monterey sucker (Catostomus occidentalis mniotiltus) and Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis).\n\nSee also\n Rivers of California\nPacheco Creek (San Benito County), a tributary of the Pajaro River, in San Benito County, California.\nSouth Fork Pacheco Creek, a tributary stream of Pacheco Creek (San Benito County)\nEast Fork Pacheco Creek, a tributary stream of Pacheco Creek (San Benito County)\nNorth Fork Pacheco Creek, a tributary stream of Pacheco Creek (San Benito County)\nPacheco Reservoir, California, a reservoir formed by a dam on the north fork of Pacheco Creek (San Benito County) a.k.a. \"North Fork Dam\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Pajaro River Watershed Council\n\nTributaries of the Pajaro River\nRivers of Santa Clara County, California\nRivers of Santa Cruz County, California\nRivers of Monterey County, California\nRivers of San Benito County, California\nRivers of Northern California", "machine_abstract": "Pacheco Creek is a river in San Benito County, California that flows through the Santa Ynez Mountains and into the Pacific Ocean at Pacheco Point on Santa Barbara Island off of Ventura, California.

{"id": "Posthuman", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthuman", "title": "Posthuman", "text": "Posthuman or post-human is a concept originating in the fields of science fiction, futurology, contemporary art, and philosophy that means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond being human. The concept aims at addressing a variety of questions, including ethics and justice, language and trans-species communication, social systems, and the intellectual aspirations of interdisciplinarity.\n\nPosthumanism is not to be confused with transhumanism (the biotechnological enhancement of human beings) and narrow definitions of the posthuman as the hoped-for transcendence of materiality. The notion of the posthuman comes up both in posthumanism as well as transhumanism, but it has a special meaning in each tradition. In 2017, Penn State University Press in cooperation with Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and James Hughes established the Journal of Posthuman Studies, in which all aspects of the concept \"posthuman\" can be analysed.\n\nPosthumanism\n\nIn critical theory, the posthuman is a speculative being that represents or seeks to re-conceive the human. It is the object of posthumanist criticism, which critically questions humanism, a branch of humanist philosophy which claims that human nature is a universal state from which the human being emerges; human nature is autonomous, rational, capable of free will, and unified in itself as the apex of existence. Thus, the posthuman position recognizes imperfectability and disunity within oneself, and understands the world through heterogeneous perspectives while seeking to maintain intellectual rigor and dedication to objective observations.  Key to this posthuman practice is the ability to fluidly change perspectives and manifest oneself through different identities. The posthuman, for critical theorists of the subject, has an emergent ontology rather than a stable one; in other words, the posthuman is not a singular, defined individual, but rather one who can \"become\" or embody different identities and understand the world from multiple, heterogeneous perspectives.\n\nApproaches to posthumanism are not homogeneous, and have often being very critical. The term itself is contested, with one of the foremost authors associated with posthumanism, Manuel de Landa, decrying the term as \"very silly.\" Covering the ideas of, for example, Robert Pepperell's The Posthuman Condition, and Hayles's How We Became Posthuman under a single term is distinctly problematic due to these contradictions.\n\nThe posthuman is roughly synonymous with the \"cyborg\" of A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway. Haraway's conception of the cyborg is an ironic take on traditional conceptions of the cyborg that inverts the traditional trope of the cyborg whose presence questions the salient line between humans and robots. Haraway's cyborg is in many ways the \"beta\" version of the posthuman, as her cyborg theory prompted the issue to be taken up in critical theory. Following Haraway, Hayles, whose work grounds much of the critical posthuman discourse, asserts that liberal humanism—which separates the mind from the body and thus portrays the body as a \"shell\" or vehicle for the mind—becomes increasingly complicated in the late 20th and 21st centuries because information technology puts the human body in question. Hayles maintains that we must be conscious of information technology advancements while understanding information as \"disembodied,\" that is, something which cannot fundamentally replace the human body but can only be incorporated into it and human life practices.\n\nPost-posthumanism and post-cyborg ethics\nThe idea of post-posthumanism (post-cyborgism) has recently been introduced.\nThis body of work outlines the after-effects of long-term adaptation to cyborg technologies and their subsequent removal, e.g., what happens after 20 years of constantly wearing computer-mediating eyeglass technologies and subsequently removing them, and of long-term adaptation to virtual worlds followed by return to \"reality.\" and the associated post-cyborg ethics (e.g. the ethics of forced removal of cyborg technologies by authorities, etc.).\n\nPosthuman political and natural rights have been framed on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. Posthumanism broadens the scope of what it means to be a valued life form and to be treated as such (in contrast to certain life forms being seen as less-than and being taken advantage of or killed off); it “calls for a more inclusive definition of life, and a greater moral-ethical response, and responsibility, to non-human life forms in the age of species blurring and species mixing.  … [I]t interrogates the hierarchic ordering – and subsequently exploitation and even eradication – of life forms.”\n\nTranshumanism\n\nDefinition\n\nAccording to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being \"whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.\" Posthumans primarily focus on cybernetics, the posthuman consequent and the relationship to digital technology. Steve Nichols published the Posthuman Movement manifesto in 1988. His early evolutionary theory of mind (MVT) allows development of sentient E1 brains. The emphasis is on systems. Transhumanism does not focus on either of these. Instead, transhumanism focuses on the modification of the human species via any kind of emerging science, including genetic engineering, digital technology, and bioengineering.\n\nMethods\n\nPosthumans could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or a symbiosis of human and artificial intelligence, or uploaded consciousnesses, or the result of making many smaller but cumulatively profound technological augmentations to a biological human, i.e. a cyborg.  Some examples of the latter are redesigning the human organism using advanced nanotechnology or radical enhancement using some combination of technologies such as genetic engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension therapies, neural interfaces, advanced information management tools, memory enhancing drugs, wearable or implanted computers, and cognitive techniques.\n\nPosthuman future\nAs used in this article, \"posthuman\" does not necessarily refer to a conjectured future where humans are extinct or otherwise absent from the Earth. Kevin Warwick says that both humans and posthumans will continue to exist but the latter will predominate in society over the former because of their abilities. Recently, scholars have begun to speculate that posthumanism provides an alternative analysis of apocalyptic cinema and fiction, often casting vampires, werewolves and even zombies as potential evolutions of the human form and being.\n\nMany science fiction authors, such as Greg Egan, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Bruce Sterling, Frederik Pohl, Greg Bear, Charles Stross, Neal Asher, Ken MacLeod, Peter F. Hamilton and authors of the Orion's Arm Universe, have written works set in posthuman futures.\n\nPosthuman God\nA variation on the posthuman theme is the notion of a \"posthuman god\"; the idea that posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of human nature, might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear possibly god-like by present-day human standards. This notion should not be interpreted as being related to the idea portrayed in some science fiction that a sufficiently advanced species may \"ascend\" to a higher plane of existence—rather, it merely means that some posthuman beings may become so exceedingly intelligent and technologically sophisticated that their behaviour would not possibly be comprehensible to modern humans, purely by reason of their limited intelligence and imagination.\n\nSee also\n\n Biohacking\n Biopunk\n Kardashev scale\n Nanopunk\n Posthumanization\n Postcyberpunk\n Speculative evolution\n Technological singularity\n Web life\n\nReferences\n\nCritical theory\nHuman evolution\nHuman-derived fictional species\nTranshumanism\nOntology\n\nScience fiction themes", "machine_abstract": "The posthuman is the subject of speculative fiction, and has been described as \"the new monster\" by philosopher Peter Sloterdijk in his essay The Posthuman (1999).[1][2][3][4][5]", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Posthuman\".

{"id": "William Smith (loyalist)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Smith%20%28loyalist%29", "title": "William Smith (loyalist)", "text": "William \"Plum\" Smith (sometimes erroneously spelt Smyth) (26 January 1954 – 8 June 2016) was a Northern Irish loyalist, former paramilitary, and politician. He had been involved in Ulster loyalism in various capacities for at least forty years.\n\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Mountjoy Street on Belfast's Shankill Road into a poor Ulster Protestant family, the son of shipyard worker Charles William Smith and his wife Isobel. He had three older sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Nan (the latter dying in infancy before he was born), a younger brother Gordon and a younger sister Jean. There was rumoured Native American ancestry in his family; therefore in his youth he acquired the lifelong nickname \"Plum\" after The Beano character Little Plum. He was raised in a working class home where his parents sent him to Sunday school and taught him to respect the law. Like many of his contemporaries from similar backgrounds on both sides of the divide, the outbreak of the socio-political\religious conflict that came to be known as the Troubles in 1969 saw him become involved in paramilitarism.\n\nMove to paramilitarism\nFollowing the introduction of internment in 1971, Smith worked for a time as an orderly in Crumlin Road Gaol where he served six months for rioting against the British Army in the Highfield estate. Unbeknownst to the prison authorities, Smith was working as a mole for the imprisoned Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leader Gusty Spence, passing on information about the conditions in which the internees were being held.\n\nAround this time Smith was a member of the vigilante group and was part of a group within the SDA that later became the Red Hand Commando, including founder John McKeague, who decided to form a new, more active organisation. In 1972, Smith was a founder-member of this new group, which quickly became an elite squad augmenting the UVF.\n\nOn 1 July Smith was one of two armed RHC men to meet Spence when he was released from prison to attend the wedding of his daughter to Winkie Rea. He took Spence to a meeting of the UVF leadership where a plan was hatched to keep Spence out of prison. A few days later when Spence was being returned to jail by his nephew Frankie Curry, their car was stopped on Belfast's Springmartin Road and Spence \"kidnapped\" by UVF/RHC operatives.\n\nSoon after this incident Smith was himself arrested for his part in the attempted murder of Catholic civilian Joseph Hall, a drive-by shooting that Smith would later admit was motivated by \"pure sectarianism and bigotry\". Smith was handed a ten-year prison sentence for the shooting. Tried along with Ronnie McCullough and Tom Reid, Smith pleaded not guilty although he subsequently admitted that he did so to satisfy the UVF's policy of members never pleading guilty and would state that \"we were caught red-handed\".\n\nIn the Maze\nAlong with the likes of Billy Hutchinson, David Ervine and Billy Mitchell, Smith was one of those on the UVF wings of the Maze prison in the 1970s to be won over by Gusty Spence to his newer, more politicised, way of thinking. This cadre of Spence-trained political figures would go on to play a leading role in bringing about the UVF ceasefire in 1994 as members of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). He learnt Irish during his time in prison, and was happy to refer to the language as 'his own'. Smith was released on 28 July 1977 after serving five years of a ten-year sentence.\n\nPolitical activity\n\nSmith secured a job in the Harland & Wolff shipyard in 1978 and became involved in trade union activity, initially as a shop steward before ultimately ending up a member of the general executive of the Transport & General Workers Union. He was dismissed from the shipyard in 1988 following a period of restructuring that involved a sell-off of part of the business, although Smith contended that his trade union activity had hastened his removal by making him unpopular with the management.\n\nAt this point the unemployed Smith became involved with a number of community schemes on the Shankill Road that were organised by Gusty Spence, initially in a voluntary capacity. The two became close and when Spence undertook a reorganisation of the PUP in 1990, Smith was given the role of chairman and Prisons Spokesman, along with Hugh Smyth as leader, David Ervine as Political Spokesman and Spence and Jim McDonald as members of the party executive.\n\nThrough Spence, Smith established contacts with Joe Colgan, a Dublin-based Irish republican, and in March 1993 the two arranged an event in the city at which both a member of the UVF and the trade unionist Chris Hudson were in attendance. As a result of the meeting Hudson opened a regular channel of contact with the UVF through which he exhorted them to seek peace.\n\nThe Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire was announced on 13 October 1994 at Fernhill House, Glencairn when Gusty Spence read out a joint statement of ceasefire flanked by Smith and Jim McDonald of the PUP and Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael, Davy Adams and John White. Smith was the chairman of the press conference at which Spence read out the statement. For a time he had served as Chairman of the Progressive Unionist Party itself.\n\nSmith would go on to devote his attentions to community work with the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre although he has remained a spokesman for the PUP. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the PUP in the Belfast City Council elections in 2001 in the Court district electoral area.\n\nSpeaking out in 2012 about Unionist concerns at the Maze prison becoming an IRA shrine with a proposed Conflict Transformation Centre, Smith stated that if Loyalists themselves got involved in the scheme they could tell their side of the story and no one particular group could use it as a shrine.\n\nOpposition to trials\nIn 2009 Smith was strongly critical of the report issued by the Consultative Group on the Past, as chaired by Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. He criticised the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, which investigated unsolved incidents from the Troubles, arguing that it was opening \"a can of worms\" and preventing \"closure\". He compared any attempts to reopen investigations and bring about criminal proceedings to the Nuremberg trials.\n\nIn 2010 Smith attacked the work of Victims Commissioner Brendan McAllister, who was investigating the activities of the UVF unit based on the Mount Vernon estate, north Belfast, during the Troubles. Smith argued that such investigations contravened a guarantee he had been given by Mo Mowlam that offences committed before 1998 could not be prosecuted due to a general amnesty. Soon afterwards Smith claimed that a document released by the British and Irish governments proved that the deal was in place as he claimed. In support of his stance Smith even gave evidence at the trial of Gerry McGeough, arguing that the republican should not have been tried for the 1981 attempted murder of Sammy Brush because of the supposed deal being in place.\n\nBook\nSmith launched his book Inside Man, Loyalists of Long Kesh – The Untold Story () on 13 October 2014, the twentieth anniversary of the CLMC ceasefire. The book argues that thanks to politicisation and education a group of prominent loyalists prisoners came to support negotiation with their republican counterparts, leading to the eventual Northern Ireland peace process. The book mainly dealt with the experiences of loyalist prisoners within the Maze and was not intended as an autobiography.\n\nDeath\nSmith died on 8 June 2016, aged 62 after a short illness. Former PUP leader Brian Ervine paid tribute to his negotiating skills by bringing the RHC & UVF to the peace process, his intelligence, left thinking politics and for his cross community work. Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness praised his contribution and commitment to the peace process.\n\nHis funeral was held in St. Matthew's Church of Ireland on the Woodvale Road. Community worker and former loyalist prisoner Jim Wilson described Smith's contribution to loyalism as 'massive' during The Troubles but later became an 'architect of peace'. Wilson also commented that Sinn Féin representative's presence at the funeral proved Smith's sincerity at extending the hand of friendship across the sectarian divide.\n\nReferences\n\n1954 births\n2016 deaths\nUlster Volunteer Force members\nProgressive Unionist Party politicians\nPoliticians from Belfast\nRed Hand Commando members\nTrade unionists from Belfast", "machine_abstract": "For other people named William Smith, see List of people called William Smith.\nWilliam Smith was the leader in 1745–1746 of loyalists who fled from Ulster to Scotland after the Jacobite risings and were known as United Irishmen or Old Rough Diamonds.

Estimations vary as to the abruptness of the reversal. A 2004 paper estimated that it took over several thousand years; a 2010 paper estimated that it occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime; a 2019 paper estimated that the reversal lasted 22,000 years.\n\nThe apparent duration at any particular location can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude and local effects of non-dipole components of the Earth's field during the transition.\n\nThe Brunhes–Matuyama reversal is a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), selected by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a marker for the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, also known as the Ionian Stage. It is useful in dating ocean sediment cores and subaerially erupted volcanics. There is a highly speculative theory that connects this event to the large Australasian strewnfield (c. 790,000 years ago), although the causes of the two are almost certainly unconnected and only coincidentally happened at the same time. Adding to the data is the large African Bosumtwi impact event (c. 1.07 million years ago) and the later Jaramillo reversal (c. 1 million years ago), another pair of events which has not gone unnoticed.\n\nSee also\n Bosumtwi impact event\n Geomagnetic reversal\n Jaramillo reversal\nList of geomagnetic reversals\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nBehrendt, J.C., Finn, C., Morse, L., Blankenship, D.D. \"One hundred negative magnetic anomalies over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), in particular Mt.

It is located in Nordkapp Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county in the far northern part of Norway. The tunnel takes the European route E69 highway under the Magerøysundet strait between the Norwegian mainland and the large island of Magerøya.  The tunnel was built between 1993 and 1999, along with the Honningsvåg Tunnel.  The tunnels were built to connect the mainland of Norway with the town of Honningsvåg and the tourist attraction at the North Cape.  The tunnel was officially opened on 15 June 1999 by King Harald V of Norway. The tunnel is  long and reaches a depth of  below sea level.  Before the tunnel was built, a ferry carried the traffic across the sea between the village of Kåfjord and the town of Honningsvåg.\n\nThe tunnel takes its name from the North Cape on the northern shore of Magerøya island.  North Cape Tunnel is part of the European route E69 highway.  Since 29 June 2012, there is no longer a toll for passing through the tunnel. Before this date there was a toll of  per car, plus an additional  per adult and  per child, in each direction.\n\nThe tunnel has automatic anti-freezing doors () which close the mouths of the tunnel in the winter to avoid the freezing of any leaking water. These gates open automatically when cars approach and are permanently open in the summer, when traffic is denser.\n\nReferences\n\nRoad tunnels in Troms og Finnmark\nFormer toll tunnels\nSubsea tunnels in Norway\n1999 establishments in Norway\nTunnels completed in 1999\nNordkapp\nRoads within the Arctic Circle", "machine_abstract": "The North Cape tunnel is the longest railway tunnel in Sweden, and one of its most important transport links between northern Europe and southern Scandinavia.\nIt was built by Swedish State Railways (SJ) from 1965 to 1969 as part of their plan to upgrade the entire network into standard gauge track.

{"id": "Christian courtship", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20courtship", "title": "Christian courtship", "text": "Christian courtship, also known as Biblical courtship, is the traditional Christian practice of individuals in approaching \"the prospect of marriage\". Preceded by a proposal, courtship traditionally begins after a betrothal and concludes with the celebration of marriage (though in the present-day, courtship may precede the betrothal, which is then followed by the wedding). Christian theologian John Piper distinguished courtship from dating, teaching that:\n\nAndre Marie, a brother of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, discusses that courtship allows a couple to become acquainted with one another, and that physical intimacy is saved only for those in wedlock. Christian minister Patricia Bootsma further delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in \"courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors\". She further states that with courtship, \"commitment happens before intimacy\". \n\nChristian courtship remains normative in certain Christian countries such as Guatemala, in which much of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. In the United States, courtship is seen as a response to secular dating culture in which various Christian communities might find themselves, c. 1985 to present. Motivated by concern for the need of Christian values in contrast to secular dating practices, conservative Christians identified what they saw as key Biblical principles for courtship and romance, and began to disseminate them in the 1980s.\n\nThe practice of traditional Christian courtship among church members belonging to various Christian denominations experienced a revival in the 1980s. Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s. Proponents of courtship say that it is identified by Biblical principles, rather than particular methods or behavioural practices. These principles have been summarized in Leave Dating Behind: a Road Map to Marriage by Christina Rogers within the acronym CARE:\nCommitment to marriage\nAccountability \nRejection of the secular dating philosophy\nEstablishing physical boundaries (Song of Songs 2:7)\n\nCharacteristics of traditional Christian courtship \n The guardianship responsibility of fathers over single daughters.\n The responsibility of parents to prepare their children for marriage in all respects, and for youths to be prepared in terms of talents, education, vocation and finances prior to seeking a courtship relationship.\n The mentoring role of parents or other suitable \"accountability couples\" in a given courtship.\n Supervision of courtships to mitigate temptations or abuse, whether of a sexual, emotional or financial nature.\n Emphasis of the importance of marriage as an opportunity for Christian service rather than a selfish endeavor.\n Emphasis of the importance of singleness before marriage as a time for greater Christian service in the community, rather than a time to be employed in selfish pursuits.\n Emphasis of the importance of counsel and evaluation by family and friends as a relationship progresses.

{"id": "Choi Jungsook", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi%20Jungsook", "title": "Choi Jungsook", "text": "Choi Jungsook (10 February 1902 – 23 February 1977) was an activist in the Korean independence movement and women's movement. She was also an educator, a doctor, the first woman principal in Jeju, and the first woman superintendent in South Korea. Through her achievements, she was conferred a decoration by the Pope and she was honored with 516 national awards. She was the woman who devoted herself to education, public welfare, and medicine of her hometown and country.\n\nEarly life and education \nChoi was born as the first daughter of Choi Wonsoon, who was a lawyer in Samdori, Jeju. Her father let her enter Shin-seong Girls' School, which a French priest established.\n\nMeanwhile, when Choi was 8, Korea came under Japanese rule. When she was 12, she received baptism because of the influence of her teacher nun. Then she became the first graduate in that school. After graduation, she entered Kyungsung National Women's High School to study education. Most of the teachers and students were Japanese, so Korean students faced much hostility.\n\nCareer\nAfter Emperor Gojong died in 1919, she went to Daehanmun and wept with compatriots. She organized a girl's suicide squad for save-the-nation drive with 79 students. It was led by Park, Heedo, who drafted the Declaration of Independence. They also joined the March 1st Movement and shouted \"Hurrah for Korean Independence Day\" after leaping over the fences of their dormitories. Consequently, she was caught by the Japanese military police and tortured.\n\nAfter the hardships of prison life, she came back to her hometown. She was aware that teaching unenlightened people was necessary to get the country back. So she established Yeosuwon and taught students, illiterate people, women and girls. Because of the hardships of prison life, she was in poor health. Finally, she decided to learn medicine for philanthropic work. So she entered Kyungsung Women's Medical School when she was 37 years old. After getting a medical license, she worked in Seongmo Hospital.\n\t\nMeanwhile, she heard the news that Jeju had a bad situation. So she came back to her hometown, opened Junghwa Hospital and treated patients. One year later, Korean Independence Day came, and she decided to make comrades be aware of their illiteracy. So she spread out movement of Shinseong's restoration and finally got a license of establishing Shinseong Girls' Middle School and High School. And she became the principal of those schools. She dedicated herself to women's education and welfare service in Jeju until she retired due to the age limit. After all, the Vatican conferred a decoration of the Pope for her merits of contribution to education, public welfare, and medicine.\n\nAfter retirement as the principal, she was concentrating on treating patients. At that time, she heard the news that she had been elected to the first superintendent in Jeju. She has been the only woman superintendent in Korea. During the four years of her tenure in office, she built 270 elementary classrooms and 66 secondary classrooms. She focused on women's education and touched off a boom of library construction. In the end, she was honored with 516 national award and she made a Junghwa scholarship fund with a prize of one million won. She devoted herself to the development of Jeju, but she couldn't accomplish her dream of becoming a nun. However, she lived like a nun as a spinster, and she gave her life to the work of God. She died at the age of 76 on 22 February 1977. After her death, she received a presidential citation in 1993, and she was selected as an independence movement fighter from Jeju in March 2006.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Han, Limhwa.

The person experiences something that resembles the intuitive, but instead, the experience is qualified as delirious. This illusion is also described as autochthonous.\n\nThis description, in abnormal behavior, and communicated in abnormal speech, is translated from the German Wahneinfall. Delusional is, specifically, a false, capricious or whimsical opinion.\n\n \nDelirious intuition is a relevant term for the fields of psychiatry and psychology and describes the expression of thoughts that have no apparent basis in inference. It usually happens in a clinical setting, is apparently impossible or improbable in the sense that the semantic relationships of the subjects within the content of speech they have no basis in reality, that is, it is from a thought that is delirious.\n\nDescription\nThis description of a psychological phenomenon, that is as observed in the form of expression  within behaviour abnormally, and communicated in abnormal speech, is translated   from the German Wahneinfall.

A phenomenological understanding  is of an occurrence that is very much like the expression of the spontaneous occurrence of an inspirational  idea, sprung from the soil, translated into a delusionary vehicle  with the conviction of \"immediate enlightenment\" (Leon et al 1989) that occurs as a delire d'embléé id est complete in the actual instance. The delusion as defined  autochthonous in this context is known  as  primary  (Jaspers 1963).\n\nOccurrence\nThe delusion is found described in clinical settings as a description of medical symptom of the psychotic illness known as schizophrenia, and is known within that milieu as a first rank symptom The delusional ideation sometimes occurs from a prior delusional mood (Fish 1985). According to the Klaus Conrad 1958 account, grātia gratiam parit, the delusion occurs as a second order development of earlier delusionary thinking.\n\nSee also\nGlossary of psychiatry\n\nReferences \n\n  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\nSchizophrenia\nPsychosis", "machine_abstract": "The term delusional intuition was coined by the German psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1908 to describe what he saw as one of three main components (alongside association and autism) that make up schizophrenia,[1][2][3][4] although it is now considered obsolete or archaic terminology[citation needed].\nIntuition", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Delusional intuition\".

{"id": "Frieston", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieston", "title": "Frieston", "text": "Frieston is a village in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated just west of the A607 road, and  north from the market town of Grantham. Frieston is conjoined to the southern part of the village of Caythorpe.\n\nFrieston lies within Caythorpe civil parish. Local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganisation of 1 April 1974, which resulted from the 1972 Local Government Act. Hitherto, the parish had formed part of the Parts of Kesteven. Kesteven was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the 1888 Local Government Act Kesteven had been, in most respects, a county in itself.\n\nThis seems to be an example of the migration of a village. 'Frieston' is a name which belongs to the 5th-century settlement of Britain by Anglo-Saxons, in this area mainly Angles, but in this case Frisians. The thorpe element of Caythorpe indicates a secondary settlement by Vikings, in this case probably Danes, at some time between 800 and 1050.\n\nNotable people\nEdmund Weaver, 18th-century astronomer and land agent, lived at Frieston. He was buried at St Vincent's Church, Caythorpe, where his memorial is placed in the south chancel.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nVillages in Lincolnshire\nSouth Kesteven District", "machine_abstract": "The Frieston is a river of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\nIt rises in the Henglemann Hills near Wipperfurth and flows through the municipalities of Dörrenberghausen (in which it forms part of the border between Westphalian-Lippe), Schönebeck, Buxtehude, Lübeck, Rostock, Stralsund und Greifswald before emptying into the Baltic Sea at Stolpe.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Frieston\".

The brick townhouse, built c. 1806, is notable as the home for many years of Charles Sumner (1811–1874), an outspoken and aggressive political opponent of slavery, whose beating on the floor of the United States Senate in 1856 was a defining moment of the pre-American Civil War period. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Sumner is a four-story townhouse, faced in brick, which was built c. 1806. The interior has a typical side hall plan, with a front parlor, behind which are a sitting room and kitchen. Its upper floors have similar arrangements of rooms. The house was Charles Sumner's home for thirty years.\n\nCharles Sumner was born to abolitionist parents, and was educated at Harvard College, where he studied law under Joseph Story. Sumner became politically active in the fight against slavery in the 1840s, when he also gained a reputation as an orator. He helped found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848, under whose banner he won election to the United States Senate in 1851. This marked the beginning of a more vocal and aggressive opposition to slavery in the political halls of Washington, D.C. His searing verbal reprobation of his opponents escalated into violence when he was beaten unconscious on the floor of the Senate by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in 1856, an event that emotionally polarized the country. After Sumner's recovery, he returned to the Senate, where he played a leading role as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War, as an advocate of emancipation. After the war he championed civil rights for free slaves during the Reconstruction Era, and played a role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nThe house was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nImages\n\nSee also\n List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston\n National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nHouses completed in 1806\nNational Historic Landmarks in Boston\nHouses in Boston\nBeacon Hill, Boston\nHistoric district contributing properties in Massachusetts\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Suffolk County, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places in Boston\nSumner family", "machine_abstract": "The Charles Summers House is located at the corner of West Street and South Pearl Street in Boston, Massachusetts.

During his career, much was apparently made of Childs' pudgy appearance. Standing 5'8\" tall, he weighed 185 pounds. This led to the nickname of \"Cupid\", as he was said to resemble a cherub.\n\nCareer\nChilds led the league in runs (136) in  with the Cleveland Spiders. The 1892 Spiders featured several stars, including future Hall of Fame members Cy Young, George Davis and Jesse Burkett. The team went to the league championship series, where they lost to the Boston Beaneaters. They had similar success in 1895, when they finished second in the league and played in the Temple Cup.\n\nChilds was among the top ten players in the league in walks every season between 1890 and 1900; he finished second in walks every season between 1891 and 1894. He led the league in doubles and extra base hits in 1890. In May 1900, Childs was attempting a double play against the Pittsburgh Pirates when the Pirates player-manager Fred Clarke slid into him. There was a brief confrontation on the field, and then Childs spotted Clarke at a train station after the game. Childs charged Clarke and badly beat the manager in the ensuing fistfight. The next day, fans in Pittsburgh showed up in large numbers (triple the average Monday attendance) hoping to see a continuation of the scuffle, but the game was played without incident.\n\nChilds' playing time fell off in his final season of 1901 (63 games, from 137 the previous year) as Pete Childs (no known relationship) played more of the team's games at second base. A career .306 hitter, Childs retired with a .416 on-base percentage, 991 walks and 269 stolen bases, having played more than 1400 games as a second baseman.\n\nLater life\nBy the time he was 45, Childs was living in Baltimore, Maryland, and he had developed cirrhosis and nephritis (known as Bright's disease at the time). He died in Baltimore on November 8, 1912. He was buried there at Loudon Park Cemetery.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBaseball players from Maryland\nMajor League Baseball second basemen\nPhiladelphia Quakers players\nCleveland Spiders players\nSt. Louis Perfectos players\nChicago Orphans players\nSyracuse Stars (AA) players\n1867 births\n1912 deaths\nPeople from Calvert County, Maryland\nToledo Swamp Angels players\nSyracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players\nJersey City Skeeters players\nMontgomery Black Sox players\nBaltimore Orioles (IL) players\nSchenectady Electricians players\nScranton Miners players\n19th-century baseball players", "machine_abstract": "Cupid Childs (born in London, England) is the daughter of English actor David Threlfall and American actress Judith Light . - birth name \n\n\n\n- image \n\n\n\n\n\n- occupation \n\n\n\n- years active \n\n\n\n- spouse", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Cupid Childs\".

He was later loaned to Železničar Smederevo in order to gain experience. Later on, Ranković also spent some time at Dubočica while serving his military duty in Leskovac.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Ranković returned to Sartid and played three games in the 2000–01 season. He also sat on the bench in all four matches in the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, with the arrival of Dragan Žilić and Nebojša Milekić, Ranković was sent out on loan to Bosnian side Slavija Sarajevo for the rest of the 2001–02 season.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Ranković made another return to Sartid and became a member of the squad that won the Serbia and Montenegro Cup in the 2002–03 season. He began receiving more playing time after the departure of Žilić in the summer of 2004. Following the club's relegation from the top flight in 2008, Ranković established himself as the team's first-choice goalkeeper and helped them earn promotion back straight away. He continued playing regularly for the side over the next three seasons.\n\nLater career\nIn July 2012, Ranković moved to fellow Serbian SuperLiga club Sloboda Užice on a free transfer. He missed just one league game in the 2012–13 season, as the team narrowly fell out of a UEFA Europa League spot. In the following campaign, Ranković again missed just one league match, but failed to help the side avoid relegation from the top flight.\n\nDuring the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, Ranković played regularly for Serbian First League club Sloga Petrovac.\n\nPersonal life\nNicknamed Šnicla (Serbian for \"schnitzel\"), Ranković is a car mechanic, owning and maintaining an oldsmobile from 1968.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\nSartid Smederevo\n Serbia and Montenegro Cup: 2002–03\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\nAssociation football goalkeepers\nExpatriate footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nFirst League of Serbia and Montenegro players\nFK Dubočica players\nFK Slavija Sarajevo players\nFK Sloboda Užice players\nFK Sloga Petrovac na Mlavi players\nFK Smederevo players\nSerbia and Montenegro expatriate footballers\nSerbia and Montenegro expatriate sportspeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nSerbia and Montenegro footballers\nSerbian First League players\nSerbian footballers\nSerbian SuperLiga players\nSportspeople from Smederevo\n1976 births\nLiving people", "machine_abstract": "Dejan Ranković (Serbian Cyrillic: Дејан Рањовић; born September 16, 1974) is a Serbian professional football player who currently plays as defender/midfielder in the Premier League 2 club Chesterfield on loan from Championship side Blackburn Rovers until January 2013", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Dejan Ranković\".

The show is hosted by Jack Armstrong and Joe Getty. The talk show format is a mixture of libertarian political commentary, observations on local, national, and international news as well as reflections on social issues presented with humor.\n\nThe show\nThe Armstrong & Getty Show airs live from the studios of 650 KSTE in Sacramento, weekdays 6 to 10 a.m. Pacific Time.  It is also heard in Los Angeles; Las Vegas; San Francisco; San Diego; Portland, Oregon; Reno; Seattle; Tacoma; Palm Springs; Monterey; Salinas; Santa Cruz; Eugene; Salt Lake City; Ventura; Fresno; Fairbanks; Redding; Santa Maria, California; Aspen; Washington, DC; Daytona Beach; Tallahassee; Chicago; Ramsey, Illinois; Ames, Iowa; Cleveland; Great Falls, Montana; Missoula, Montana; Kansas City, Kansas; Greenwood, South Carolina; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Florence, South Carolina; Houston; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The show won the Best of Sacramento award numerous years in a row.\n\nDoug Stephan incident\nOn July 28, 2010, Armstrong and Getty were tipped off by a listener that a fellow radio talk show host, Doug Stephan, had been stealing audio material from the Armstrong and Getty show, editing the audio, and using it in his show in an attempt to portray it as if he were speaking to their caller.\n\nDuring that same broadcast, the hosts were able to speak to Douglas Stephan, himself, regarding the alleged plagiarism that appeared evident upon comparison of the duo's show content and Douglas Stephan's \"callers\" some days later. Stephen never admitted to the allegations, but apologized, saying that the calls were misplaced and accidentally played on his Good Day show.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nAmerican talk radio programs", "machine_abstract": "The Armstrong family is the name of several families that have been associated over time in various ways to the founding and development of the city of Richmond, Virginia.

As a junior officer he twice volunteered to take part in missions to search for Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to find the Northwest Passage. He also took part in the Battle of Fatshan Creek in June 1857 during the Second Opium War.\n\nLater in his career he became commander-in-chief at China Station and took his fleet into Vladivostok harbour in 1886, which surprised the Russians. He became First Naval Lord in July 1889 and in that role he was primarily concerned with implementing the recommendations contained in a report on the disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were unarmoured and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers (\"the Two-power Standard\"): these recommendations had been enshrined in the Naval Defence Act 1889. He finished his career as President of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich.\n\nEarly career\nBorn the son of the Revd John Vesey Hamilton and his wife Frances Agnes Hamilton (née Malone), Hamilton was educated at the Royal Naval School in Camberwell and joined the Royal Navy in July 1843. He was posted to the sloop  in the Mediterranean Fleet.\n\nHe volunteered to become a mate on the barque  which was despatched in 1850, under the command of Captain Erasmus Ommanney, on a mission to search for Sir John Franklin and his ill-fated expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Promoted to lieutenant on 11 October 1851, he volunteered for a second mission this time in the barque  which was despatched in 1852, under the command of Captain Henry Kellett, in search of Franklin. Resolute became stuck in the ice in the spring of 1854 and Kellett and his crew were ordered to abandon ship.\n\nHamilton was given command of the gunboat  in February 1856 and took part in the Battle of Fatshan Creek in June 1857 during the Second Opium War. Promoted to[commander on 10 August 1857, he was given command of the sloop  on the West Indies Station in June 1858.\n\nPromoted to captain on 27 January 1862, he took command of the sloop  on the West Indies Station in July 1862, the sloop  on the West Indies Station in 1865 and the broadside ironclad  on coast guard service at Portland Harbour in April 1870. He became commander of the steam reserve at Devonport in 1873 and captain-superintendent of Pembroke Dock in March 1875 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 29 May 1875.\n\nSenior command\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 27 September 1877, Hamilton was appointed Director of Naval Ordnance at the Admiralty in 1878. He was given command of the Coast of Ireland Station in 1880 and, having been promoted to vice admiral on 17 February 1884, he became commander-in-chief of China Station in September 1885; he took his fleet into Vladivostok harbour the following year and gave the Russians a surprise. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887 and promoted to full admiral on 18 October 1887.\n\nHamilton went on to be Second Naval Lord in December 1888, and First Naval Lord in July 1889. In that role he was primarily concerned with implementing the recommendations contained in a report on the disposition of the ships of the Royal Navy many of which were unarmoured and together incapable of meeting the combined threat from any two of the other naval powers (\"the Two-power Standard\"): these recommendations had been enshrined in the Naval Defence Act 1889. He became President of the Royal Naval Collega at Greenwich, in September 1891 and retired from the Navy in May 1894. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 25 May 1895.\n\nIn retirement he wrote Naval Administration; The Constitution, Character, and Functions of the Board of Admiralty, and of the Civil Departments It Directs. He died at his home in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire on 17 September 1912, and is buried at Eltham in South London.\n\nFamily\nIn 1862 Hamilton married he Julia Frances Delmé Murray; they had two sons and two daughters. William John Warburton Hamilton was his eldest brother.\n\nPublications\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n William Loney RN Career History\n \n\n1829 births\n1912 deaths\nAdmiral presidents of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich\nFirst Sea Lords and Chiefs of the Naval Staff\nKnights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath\nLords of the Admiralty\nRoyal Navy admirals\nMilitary personnel from Kent\nRoyal Navy personnel of the Second Opium War", "machine_abstract": "Richard Vesey Hamilton (born 8 May 1943) is the current Chief Justice of New South Wales, Australia's highest court and its most senior judge.\nHamilton was born in Sydney to parents who were both teachers at St Mary MacKillop College; his father Richard Hamilton taught English literature there while his mother Jean Vesey-Hamilton taught French.

{"id": "Hansard", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard", "title": "Hansard", "text": "Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the Parliament at Westminster.\n\nOrigins\nThough the history of the Hansard began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.\n\nThe many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of \"the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers\".\n\nSeveral editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society and Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia. The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in Edward Cave's The Gentleman's Magazine, which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully \"filleted\"; for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as \"Sr. R―t W―le\".\n\nIn 1771 Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the Parliamentary Register published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813.\n\nWilliam Cobbett (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing Parliamentary Debates as a supplement to his Political Register in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the Parliamentary History. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On 5 June 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found \"guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence\". The court sentence read: \"The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid\". The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as \"vindictive\". The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had \"seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all\" and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison.\n\nCobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the Parliamentary Debates and Parliamentary History, which then \"passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812\". Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates became Hansard Parliamentary Debates, \"abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard\". From 1829 the name \"Hansard\" appeared on the title page of each issue. Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of Hansard are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.\n\nHansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later Mirror of Parliament published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to \"correct\" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was The Times which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed. Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nThe Hansard of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when Parliament took over the publication and established its own staff of official Hansard reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.\n\nHansard is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons select committee in 1893, as being a report which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.\n\nOne instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of MPs to speak in the House of Commons. In that house, the Speaker must call on an MP by name before that member may speak, but Hansard makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, Hansard sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as \"the hon. Member for Constituency Name rather than by name, Hansard adds, in parentheses, the name of the MP being referred to, the first time that MP is referred to in a speech or debate. When an MP simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, Hansard identifies him or her.\n\nAny interruption to debate will be marked with the word \"(Interruption)\". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during Prime Minister's Questions, are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.\n\nHansard also publishes written answers – known as written ministerial statements – made by government ministers in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the House of Commons, printed and published a report stating that an indecent book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in Newgate Prison. Stockdale sued for defamation but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by parliamentary privilege. In the resulting case of Stockdale v Hansard, the court found that the house held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 to establish privilege for publications under the house's authority.\n\nSince 1909—and for important votes before then—Hansard has listed how members have voted in divisions. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons Hansard did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with MPs' references to other MPs of the same party as \"hon. Friends\", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The Hansard of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary written answers and statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that \"Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining\". The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK Hansard more accessible. The UK Hansard is currently being digitised to a high-level format for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK Hansard from 1803, with the exception of standing committees.\n\nBecause Hansard is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of Parliament makes an inaccurate statement in Parliament, they must write a correction in the copy of Hansard kept in the House of Commons library.\n\nIn 2010 historic copies of Hansard were sent to India in its original volume format and was transformed from the original bound versions into plain text by optical character recognition (OCR) and put on the Internet to enable easy research. In July 2018 this digitised Hansard was vastly improved and merged with the rest of Hansard as previously it was available under two websites and now it is a single website. There are still many 'typos' from the OCR process but readers are encouraged to report them when they are spotted.\n\nCanada\n\nHouse of Commons\nAs with the Westminster Hansard, the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding \"repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors\". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent (\"The member for Richmond Hill\", etc.) or by their cabinet post. Hansard supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—\"Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)\" or \"Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC)\"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.\n\nIf interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as \"Some hon. members: Oh, oh!\" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:\n\nTranslation\nGiven the bilingual nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian Hansards are maintained, one in French and one in English. This makes it a natural parallel text, and it is often used to train French–English machine translation programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the Hansards and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive corpus. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.\n\nThe Canadian Hansard records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English Hansard records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French Hansard record.\n\nIn one instance, during a Liberal filibuster in the Senate of Canada, Senator Philippe Gigantès was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the Hansard.\n\nNewfoundland\nIn Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of Saint John's Ledger, \"had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark\". The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. \nThe Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the Ledger, made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits. In another case, a \"Gentleman by the name Parsons\", of the Newfoundland Patriot, \"was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident\".\n\nNova Scotia\nAs was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the Halifax Gazette, was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the Acadian Recorder, founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the Free Press, established in 1816 by Edward Ward. Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.\n\nThe Family Compact of Nova Scotia, nicknamed \"the little compact\", \"viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain\" and \"were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront\". There are many cases which exemplify the \"struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes\" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.\n\nThe Novascotian newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by George Young who was instrumental in its establishment. George Young sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.\n\nIn 1827 Joseph Howe bought the Novascotian from Young. \"There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe\". In 1835 Joseph Howe was \"prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the Novascotian\". He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a \"cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada\". Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.\n\nOntario\n\nNo official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953. The provincial website now posts Hansard online, with records from March 29, 1977, to current.\n\nAlberta\nAlberta adopted a Hansard in 1972. From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook Hansard, which is available online. News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.\n\nIn 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk's office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create Alberta Hansard, and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.\n\nHansard staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other Hansards, Alberta Hansard follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to \"the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.\"\n\nTranscripts for Legislative Assembly of Alberta proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day's sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words. Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nNo complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa Hansard, opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: \"A. Wilkinson\". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with \"Honourable\": \"Hon. S. Hagen\". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as \"Interjection\". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line (\"Motion approved\" or \"Motion negatived\").\n\nAustralia\nThe Parliament of Australia also keeps record of debates, using the term Hansard. The records are published by the State Law Publisher. The Parliament of South Australia was the first convict free Australian colony to use Hansard; where it became a convention from 1857.  The Parliament of Victoria followed the lead of South Australia by introducing the use of Hansard in 1866. The Parliament of New South Wales commenced its Hansard system on 28 October 1879 with the reporting of the Legislative Council at the opening of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nOn 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the New Zealand Parliament. Ever since that day official transcripts of members' speeches in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been continuously published.\n\nToday the New Zealand Hansard is produced by a team of 17 FTE Hansard Editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Hansard is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.\n\nSpeeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words members use in the chamber. Hansard is as close to verbatim as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. Members are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website.

The family was Jewish but not religious. The family moved to Antwerp, where Van Praag attended elementary and high school.\n\nIn 1931 the family Van Praag was again registered in Amsterdam, and Henri attended the five-year course at the municipal training college (diploma 1936), where he met Leny van Huystee, whom he married in 1947. In 1938 he received his certificate of competency as headmaster, and  in 1939 a teaching certificate in French. At this time his interest in mysticism led him to read Chinese sage Li, a Jewish mystic whose name he never mentioned, the theologian J. Eykman (1892-1945) and the philosopher-physicist-educator Dr Philip Kohnstamm (1875-1951). He also had a practice as a psychologist and psychotherapist.\n\nVan Praag spent World War II in hiding, in Amsterdam and other places. Many of his relatives were deported to concentration camps, where more than seventy relatives were murdered. Leny maintained contact with him during this period.\n\nPost-war career\nAfter the war, Van Praag wanted to work for peace, and \"turned [...] to people across all boundaries of religion, or national cultures. He exchanged as any other information from Judaism to Buddhism, of Taoism to gnosticism, from theology to science.\n\nAfter obtaining the deed Dutch Language and Literature for secondary education (1946), he began an eagerness for several university studies: general philosophy of science, physics and pedagogy (Kohnstamm), logic (Evert Willem Beth), mathematics (L.E.J. Brouwer), biology (Heimans), sociology (Mennicken), economics (Mermans), general linguistics (Marcel Cohen), history (Jacques Presser), Judaica (Joseph B. Soloveitchik), psychology (Otto Selz) and phenomenology of religion and cultural anthropology (Gerard van der Leeuw). \nMeanwhile, he was heavily involved with the Jews returning from the camps, especially in children. He conducted research for the Institute for the Tropics. His first, not in book form, study number, time and space, (1949) deals with the psychological foundations of mathematics and physics. His first book, The Meaning of Education (1950), was devoted to education and ends with a passionate creed. He did bachelor's degree in 1950, Master's degree in 1951. Under the pseudonym Bernard Raimond, he published a novel in the style of mystical Meyrink, is waiting for you (1953), a document that attests to his deep interest in and knowledge of China, the Jewish mysticism and reincarnation.\n\nShortly after the war in 1946 Van Praag was director of teaching HBS (Aid Study). Hammelburg related to the pedagogic Social Work community, working at the Dutch Institute for Psychological Research in Hilversum. In 1949 he took part in the tenth congress of philosophy in Paris.

Van Praag included Otto Frank, Anne Frank's father, Zvi Werblowsky and Karl Thieme. One of the initiatives that emerged from the conference was the plan for a three-part series Das Lebendige Gottes Wort, an anthology with commentary from Jewish and Christian writings on revelation, prayer and promise. Many scholars, including Martin Buber, had agreed to cooperate, Thieme and Van Praag would lead. The plan was not implemented in this form by the sudden death of Thieme and the departure of Van Praag to Montevideo.\n\nIntermezzo Uruguay (1953-1954) \nIntermezzo Uruguay (1953-1954) in early 1950, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin to anti-Semitism. Van Praag in 1953 went to Uruguay to investigate whether this country a new home for Jewish children could be. He was visiting Montevideo in psychology, pedagogy and philosophy, while he also had a practice as a psychologist-therapist. All his life he would also like therapist (counselor) for fellows remain available, people who were on something or had a question, could always go to him for an interview or an opinion. He then listened to the other, conducted an interview and ended with this advice.\n\nHe also studied Chinese language and culture in Montevideo with Professor Li Yu-Ying (Li Shizeng), former Rector of the Imperial University of Peking. With Stalin's death and the arrival of Nikita Khrushchev in 1953 compared the situation for Jews in Russia to improve, so the mission had formed the reason for the trip to South America was halted.\n\nIn the center of society (1954-1973) \nIn the center of society was founded in 1954 with his brother Henry I. (Dorus) van Praag and I.J. Sloos, and was aimed at improving the dialogue between Jews and Christians. With Jacob Soetendorp he worked on the series Phoenix Bible Paperbacks. Soetendorp translated large parts of the Old Testament again from Hebrew into Dutch, inspired by the new German translation of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig. Van Praag had to finalize the 18 parts of Hebrew Bible, J. Goudoever of the final editing of the 12 parts of the New Testament. Van Praag also wrote the entire series of some forty articles and introductory and linking between texts and other items were the result of numerous conversations between Protestant and Catholic Christians, Jews and - to a lesser extent - Muslims.\n\nVan Praag was also active in many areas. He was appointed in 1957 as a teacher at the local training college in 4 hours per week in pedagogy and in the same year was appointed professor at the LOI (Pelman Institute). In 1958 he became director of the Center for pedagogic Psychology in Amsterdam, in 1964 he was consultant and from 1966 senior lecturer of Teleac (a relationship that until 1977 would last), (main) editor for various publishers and magazines including Studium Generale, Effective Business Management and Intermediate. He was a valued partner of leading people in the scientific, religious, political and philosophical territory.\n\nProfessor (1973-1988) \nFrom 1973 to 1978 he was professor of sociology (religious schools) at the Wageningen Agricultural University. In 1974 we started with the establishment of the International Academy of Manternach (Luxembourg), with the first academic year of 1976.

Tenhaeff as professor of parapsychology at the University of Utrecht, a position he held until 1986 would continue to play. Van Praag highlights in this field, that psychology should be seen as a border area of what is called parapsychology, as Einstein defined as a straight line curve with a degree of curvature = 0.\n\nHis wife Leny van Praag - Van Huystee deceased in 1981.\n\nBibliography \nNumber, time and space, Mathematisch Centrum, 1949\nThe Meaning of Education, De Erven F.

It has also won the Thuringia Cup on three occasions and, through this, qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe football team FC Wacker 05 Nordhausen was founded on 1 November 1905 as an offshoot of a Protestant youth club in the city. By 14 June 1906 the team had broadened its scope to become the sports club SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen  and in 1908 merged with local side Ballsport-Club Mars Nordhausen which had been formed in 1906. Until 1918 the club played as SV Wacker-Mars Nordhausen when it was renamed 1. SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen. Playing in the VMBV (Verband Mitteldeutscher Ballspiel Vereine or Federation of Middle German Ball Playing Teams), Wacker participated in the early rounds of the league championships in the mid- to late 20s, but without any success.\n\nAfter the end of World War II occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. The former membership of Wacker reorganized as SG Nordhausen in 1946 and this team went on to become the football department of the sports club BSG Motor Nordhausen in 1949. The club played briefly as KWU/Lok Nordhausen after a merger with an industrial club. From 1951 on the team played as BSG Motor Nordhausen-West in second tier East German football. Motor enjoyed some modest success in the early 80s but then slipped and was relegated to the third division Bezirkliga Erfurt in 1989.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990 the football department separated from the sports club to form FSV Wacker 90. The newly independent team took up play in the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (III) in the 1991–92 season and played at that level for seven years, interrupted by three seasons in the Regionalliga Nordost (III) from 1995 to 1998. During the 1990s the club made three appearances in the DFB-Pokal, in 1992–93, 1996–97 and 1997–98 but was knocked out in the first round at each occasion. After relegation back to the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (IV) in 1998 the club slowly declined.  Financial problems drove the club further down to the Landesliga Thüringen (V) in 2000–01 before they finally landed in the Landesklasse Thuringen-Ost (VI) in 2002.\n\nAfter a decade of lower league play the club won the Thüringenliga in 2011–12 and the NOFV-Oberliga Süd the season after to make a return to the Regionalliga Nordost where it plays today.\n\nStadium\nFSV plays its home matches in the Albert-Kuntz-Sportpark which has a capacity of 8,000 (~1,000 seats) spectators.\n\nCurrent squad\n\nHonors\nThe club's honours:\n NOFV-Oberliga Süd\n Champions: 1995, 2013\n Thüringenliga\n Champions: 2012, 2015‡\n Landesklasse Thüringen-Ost\n Champions: 2005\n Thuringia Cup\n Winners: 1992, 1996, 1997, 2019\n Runners-up: 1998, 1999, 2017\n ‡ Denotes won by reserve team.\n\nRecent seasons\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the club:\n\n With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

{"id": "Reserved word", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved%20word", "title": "Reserved word", "text": "In a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is \"reserved from use\". This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no user-define meaning.\n\nA closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms \"reserved word\" and \"keyword\" are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is \"reserved for use as a keyword\" – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above.\n\nIn general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords – these are \"reserved for future use\". In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no reserved words, with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.\n\nDistinction\nThe sets of reserved words and keywords in a language often coincide or are almost equal, and the distinction is subtle, so the terms are often used interchangeably. However, in careful usage they are distinguished.\n\nMaking keywords be reserved words makes lexing easier, as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords – for example, in Java, goto is a reserved word, but has no meaning and does not appear in any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a reserved word may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.\n\nConversely, keywords need not be reserved words, with their role understood from context, or they may be distinguished in another manner, such as by stropping. For example, the phrase if = 1 is unambiguous in most grammars, since a control statement of an if clause cannot start with an =, and thus is allowed in some languages, such as FORTRAN. Alternatively, in ALGOL 68, keywords must be stropped – marked in some way to distinguished – in the strict language by listing in bold, and thus are not reserved words. Thus in the strict language the following expression is legal, as the bold keyword if does not conflict with the ordinary identifier if:\nif if eq 0 then 1 fi\nHowever, in ALGOL 68 there is also a stropping regime in which keywords are reserved words, an example of how these distinct concepts often coincide; this is followed in many modern languages.\n\nSyntax\n \nA reserved word is one that \"looks like\" a normal word, but is not allowed to be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it satisfies the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers – for example, being a sequence of letters – but cannot be used where identifiers are used. For example, the word if is commonly a reserved word, while x generally is not, so x = 1 is a valid assignment, but if = 1 is not.\n\nKeywords have varied uses, but primarily fall into a few classes: part of the phrase grammar (specifically a production rule with nonterminal symbols), with various meanings, often being used for control flow, such as the word if in most procedural languages, which indicates a conditional and takes clauses (the nonterminal symbols); names of primitive types in a language that support a type system, such as int; primitive literal values such as true for Boolean true; or sometimes special commands like exit. Other uses of keywords in phrases are for input/output, such as print.\n\nThe distinct definitions are clear when a language is analyzed by a combination of a lexer and a parser, and the syntax of the language is generated by a lexical grammar for the words, and a context-free grammar of production rules for the phrases. This is common in analyzing modern languages, and in this case keywords are a subset of reserved words, as they must be distinguished from identifiers at the word level (hence reserved words) to be syntactically analyzed differently at the phrase level (as keywords).\n\nIn this case reserved words are defined as part of the lexical grammar, and are each tokenized as a separate type, distinct from identifiers. In conventional notation, the reserved words if and then for example are tokenized as types IF and THEN, respectively, while x and y are both tokenized as type Identifier.\n\nKeywords, by contrast, syntactically appear in the phrase grammar, as terminal symbols. For example, the production rule for a conditional expression may be IF Expression THEN Expression. In this case IF and THEN are terminal symbols, meaning \"a token of type IF or THEN, respectively\" – and due to the lexical grammar, this means the string if or then in the original source. As an example of a primitive constant value, true may be a keyword representing the boolean value \"true\", in which case it should appear in the grammar as a possible expansion of the production BinaryExpression, for instance.\n\nReserved ranges\nBeyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.\n\nThis is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.\n\nThe frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation dunder; this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.\n\nSpecification\nThe list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.\n\nReasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like class or object. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.\n\nA notable example is in Java, where const and goto are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like const to the language, which was possible using the const word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) would break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.\n\nLanguages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:\n\nThat is, C11 introduced the keyword _Thread_local within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword thread_local despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.\n\nPredefined names\nA related notion to reserved words are predefined functions, methods, subroutines, or variables, particularly library routines from the standard library. These are similar in that they are part of the basic language, and may be used for similar purposes. However, these differ in that the name of a predefined function, method, or subroutine is typically categorized as an identifier instead of a reserved word, and is not treated specially in the syntactic analysis. Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.\n\nLanguages vary as to what is provided as a keyword and what is a predefined. Some languages, for instance, provide keywords for input/output operations whereas in others these are library routines. In Python (versions earlier than 3.0) and many BASIC dialects, print is a keyword. In contrast, the C, Lisp, and Python 3.0 equivalents printf, format, and print are functions in the standard library. Similarly, in Python prior to 3.0, None, True, and False were predefined variables, but not reserved words, but in Python 3.0 they were made into reserved words.\n\nDefinition\n\nSome use the terms \"keyword\" and \"reserved word\" interchangeably, while others distinguish usage, say by using \"keyword\" to mean a word that is special only in certain contexts but \"reserved word\" to mean a special word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. The meaning of keywords — and, indeed, the meaning of the notion of keyword — differs widely from language to language. Concretely, in ALGOL 68, keywords are stropped (in the strict language, written in bold) and are not reserved words – the unstropped word can be used as an ordinary identifier.\n\nThe \"Java Language Specification\" uses the term \"keyword\". The ISO 9899 standard for the C programming language uses the term \"keyword\".\n\nIn many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a keyword is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, then, and else are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions.\n\nIn some languages, such as ALGOL and Algol 68, keywords cannot be written verbatim, but must be stropped. This means that keywords must be marked somehow. E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not reserved words, and thus the same word can be used for as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strop the keywords, and instead have them simply be reserved words.\n\nSome languages, such as PostScript, are extremely liberal in this approach, allowing core keywords to be redefined for specific purposes.\n\nIn Common Lisp, the term \"keyword\" (or \"keyword symbol\") is used for a special sort of symbol, or identifier. Unlike other symbols, which usually stand for variables or functions, keywords are self-quoting and self-evaluating:98 and are interned in the KEYWORD package. Keywords are usually used to label named arguments to functions, and to represent symbolic values.  The symbols which name functions, variables, special forms and macros in the package named COMMON-LISP are basically reserved words. The effect of redefining them is undefined in ANSI Common Lisp. Binding them is possible. For instance the expression (if if case or) is possible, when if is a local variable. The leftmost if refers to the if operator; the remaining symbols are interpreted as variable names. Since there is a separate namespace for functions and variables, if could be a local variable. In Common Lisp, however, there are two special symbols which are not in the keyword package: the symbols t and nil.  When evaluated as expressions, they evaluate to themselves. They cannot be used as the names of functions or variables, so are de facto reserved. (let ((t 42))) is a well-formed expression, but the let operator will not permit the usage.\n\nTypically, when a programmer attempts to use a keyword for a variable or function name, a compilation error will be triggered. In most modern editors, the keywords are automatically set to have a particular text colour to remind or inform the programmers that they are keywords.\n\nIn languages with macros or lazy evaluation, control flow constructs such as if can be implemented as macros or functions. In languages without these expressive features, they are generally keywords.\n\nComparison by languages\n\nNot all languages have the same numbers of reserved words.  For example, Java (and other C derivatives) has a rather sparse complement of reserved words—approximately 50 – whereas COBOL has approximately 400.   At the other end of the spectrum, pure Prolog and PL/I have none at all.\n\nThe number of reserved words in a language has little to do with how “powerful” a language is.  COBOL was designed in the 1950s as a business language and was made to be self-documenting using English-like structural elements such as verbs, clauses, sentences, sections and divisions.  C, on the other hand, was written to be very terse (syntactically) and to get more text on the screen.  For example, compare the equivalent blocks of code from C and COBOL to calculate weekly earnings:\n\n      // Calculation in C:\n      \n      if (salaried)\n              amount = 40 * payrate;\n      else\n              amount = hours * payrate;\n      \n      *> Calculation in COBOL:\n      \n      IF Salaried THEN\n              MULTIPLY Payrate BY 40 GIVING Amount\n      ELSE\n              MULTIPLY Payrate BY Hours GIVING Amount\n      END-IF.\n      \n      *> Other example of calculation in COBOL:\n      \n      IF Salaried \n              COMPUTE Amount = Payrate * 40\n      ELSE\n              COMPUTE Amount = hours * payrate\n      END-IF.\n\nPure Prolog logic is expressed in terms of relations, and execution is triggered by running queries over these relations.  Constructs such as loops are implemented using recursive relationships.\n\nAll three of these languages can solve the same types of “problems” even though they have differing numbers of reserved words.  This “power” relates to their belonging to the set of Turing-complete languages.\n\nDisadvantages\nDefinition of reserved words in a language raises problems.  The language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a long list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers.  It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, \"overloading\" of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing.  Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.\n\nBecause reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, users may choose deliberate misspellings of reserved words as identifiers instead, such as  for Java variables of type .\n\nReserved words and language independence\n\nMicrosoft's .NET   Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product.  Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language.  For example, a Visual Basic.NET library may contain a class definition such as:\n\n' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:\n\nPublic Class this\n        ' This class does something...\nEnd Class\n\nIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type “this” would encounter a problem: 'this' is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:\n\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\nthis x = new this();  // Won't compile!\n\nA similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.\n\nThis is resolved by stropping. In order to work around this issue, the specification allows the programmer to (in C#) place the at-sign before the identifier which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:\n\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\n@this x = new @this();  // Will compile! \n\nFor consistency, this usage is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.\n\nSee also\n C reserved keywords\n List of Java keywords\n Symbol (programming)\n\nReferences\n\nProgramming constructs\nProgramming language topics", "machine_abstract": "In computer programming, reserved words are keywords that have special meaning to the compiler or interpreter and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).

{"id": "Matt Wozniak", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt%20Wozniak", "title": "Matt Wozniak", "text": "Matt Wozniak (born January 6, 1983) is a Canadian curler from Winnipeg, Manitoba. He currently plays second on Team Jason Gunnlaugson. Wozniak is the former second for the Mike McEwen team which curled out of the Assiniboine Memorial Curling Club in Winnipeg.\n\nCareer\n\n2005–2010\nIn 2005, Wozniak joined the new Mike McEwen rink that included Justin Richter and Andrew Melnuk. For the 2006-07 season, Richter and Melnuk left the team and were replaced with Geordie Hargreaves and Adam Guenther. The team disbanded after just one season together.\n\nWozniak and McEwen joined with brothers Denni and B. J. Neufeld in 2007. In their first season together, they were a semi-finalist at the 2008 Safeway Championship, Manitoba's provincial championship. Their first Grand Slam event as a team was at the end season, at the 2008 Players' Championships. The team won two games, before being eliminated.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2008-09 season the McEwen team was ranked 7th on the CCA rankings. They had made it to three Grand Slam playoffs, and finished 4th at the 2009 Safeway Championship.\n\nDuring the 'Road to the Roar' 2009 Olympic Qualifier, the McEwen team just lost out to fellow Manitobans the Jason Gunnlaugson team in the semi-finals. Team McEwen thus missed out on the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials final despite being the favourite in that particular matchup vs Gunnlaugson.\n\nMcEwen's rink made it to his first provincial final in 2010, when he lost to Jeff Stoughton in the 2010 Manitoba provincial final. The game was being played in Steinbach, Manitoba and as the Neufeld brothers and their father have roots in Steinbach, were treated very much as the home team and crowd favourites.\n\n2010-2015: Grand Slam success and perennial provincial runner-up\nTeam McEwen started the 2010-11 season off well by defeating provincial rival Jeff Stoughton to win the World Cup of Curling and his first ever Grand Slam title in November, 2010. In part of the teams runner-up result in the provincial finals of 2010 and in part because of his 4 victories and leading the overall money winnings in the World Curling Tour season as of November 2010, the McEwen team was named as a nominee for the provincial team of the year by the Manitoba Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association.\n\nThe team continued their strong season that year by defeating provincial rival Stoughton in the semi-final of the 2011 Canadian Open. They would then go on to beat the Glenn Howard team in the extra end of the final, thus winning their second career Grand Slam and their second of that season.\n\nWozniak's rink once again made it to the Manitoba provincial this time, being the top seed (also ranked 1st in Canada). However, once again lost to Stoughton in the final of the 2011 Safeway Championship, losing by one point in the final end. The McEwen team then lost their third straight provincial final game at the 2012 Safeway Championship, this time losing to Rob Fowler, thus tying a provincial record for consecutive final losses previous set by Kerry Burtnyk from 97-99. This dubious record was avoided in 2013, when the McEwen rink failed to reach the final, but again losing to the rival Stoughton rink in the 2013 Safeway Championship semi-final. Once again, at the 2014 Safeway Championship, the team lost the final to Stoughton.\n\nDespite being ranked first in the world on both the World Curling Tour Order of Merit rankings and on the WCT money list, Wozniak lost his fifth provincial final in six years in 2015, losing to Reid Carruthers.\n\nThree Briers and team breakup \nWozniak's rink won their first provincial title in 2016, sending them to their first Brier. The Matt Dunstone rink had committed themselves to the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships, which occurred at the same time as the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier, so when the Dunstone rink beat Reid Carruthers in the semi-final, McEwen's team would go to the Brier, even if they had lost to Dunstone.\n\nIn 2017, Wozniak defended his Manitoba Championship by beating Reid Carruthers in the final. He would then better his 2016 Brier showing, going 9–2 in the round robin to enter the playoffs in first place and with hammer and choice of rocks (Brad Gushue was also 9–2 but lost first place due to losing his round robin meeting with Manitoba). He then lost 7–5 to Brad Gushue in the 1 vs. 2 game. In the semi finals against reigning Brier and World Champion Kevin Koe, they were in control for most of the game, being up 5–3 with hammer in the eighth end, but Koe made a comeback with a steal in the eighth end, two points in the tenth end, and another steal in the extra end, dropping Manitoba to the bronze medal game. They recovered to win their first Brier medal, defeating Brad Jacobs in their rematch of the 2016 bronze medal game, 7–6 in an extra end.\n\nWhile competing at the 2018 Viterra Championship, skip McEwen came down with chickenpox and was unable to play after the first game. B. J. Neufeld skipped the team, until a surprise appearance by McEwen in the final, where they lost to Carruthers. Despite the setback, they still had a chance to qualify for the 2018 Tim Hortons Brier through the wildcard game, which they won over Jason Gunnlaugson. Team McEwen had a difficult Brier and alongside Carruthers was unable to qualify for the playoffs. Following the Brier, the McEwen team announced they would be breaking up at the end of the 2017–18 season. Just days after the announcement, the McEwen team won the 2018 Elite 10 Grand Slam of Curling event, winning the top $28,000 prize money, and was the first team to go through the entire event undefeated. The Grand Slam victory was the team's seventh overall.\n\nWozniak took a few years off from men's play after Team McEwen broke up. However, he played mixed doubles with his current girlfriend Marlene Albrecht and spared for McEwen's new team. After Alex Forrest stepped away from competitive curling after the 2019–20 season, Wozniak joined the Jason Gunnlaugson rink. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, the 2021 provincial championship was cancelled. As Team Gunnlaugson were the reigning provincial champions, they were chosen to represent Manitoba at the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, the 2021 provincial championship was cancelled. As the reigning provincial champions, Team Gunnlaugson was chosen to represent Manitoba at the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier. At the Brier, they finished with a 6–6 record.\n\nPersonal life\nWozniak is employed as a mortgage broker for Vertuity Mortgage. He is currently in a relationship with Swiss curler Marlene Albrecht and has two children.\n\nGrand Slam record\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLiving people\nCurlers from Winnipeg\n1983 births\nCanadian male curlers\nCanada Cup (curling) participants", "machine_abstract": "Matthew John \"Wozenia\" Matt Wozniak (born September 16, 1975) is the former lead vocalist of American rock band Cold and current member of The Damned Things .

The river is the longest river in Britain and at its mouth has the second highest rise and fall of tide in the world.\n\n17th century\n\n30 January 1607, Bristol Channel floods, 1607 – the Bristol Channel and  Severn Estuary were devastated by a flood. Long considered as a storm, recent investigations point to a possible tsunami.\n\n18th century\n\n23 October 1799, the ferry at The Tuckies carrying workers from Coalport China Works capsized and 28 were drowned.\n\n19th century\n\n6 February 1809, the Newnham on Severn to Arlingham Passage ferryboat sank in full view of people on both banks of the Severn. Two boatmen on board drowned.\n1 February 1868, at the bridge over the Severn at Caersws an approach embankment, damaged by flood water, collapsed under a goods train. The driver and fireman were killed.\n\n20th century\n\n4 August 1919, on this Bank Holiday Monday pleasure boats were taking people on trips between Gloucester and Stourport. One boat, the May Queen, came downriver passing the Hampstall Ferry, (located between Stourport and Holt Fleet), at speed. The ferryboat lurched and all 17 passengers were tipped into the river. Some witnesses said the ferry was overloaded. Nine people were drowned.\n4 February 1939, three tanker barges overturned in the estuary off Sharpness. They were taken with the tide into the piers of the Severn Railway Bridge. Of the eight man crew, six men were killed\n3 April 1947, a British ship, the 1,580 ton Stancliffe, went aground off Sharpness loaded with 3,000 tons of timber. Local shipyard engineer, Ivor Langford, managed to cut the vessel in two and sail both parts down to Cardiff Docks. There the two halves were joined together and the ship sailed again under the new name of .\n23 March 1951, a large 4,845 ton Egyptian registered ship  was bound for Sharpness loaded with 7,000 tons of maize from Russia when she ran aground on Lydney Sands. Unable to float her off, the cargo had to be unloaded out in the estuary into smaller craft. Eventually she became a total loss. The wreck can be seen occasionally above the mud at low water.\n4 February, 1954, a Bristol Britannia G-ALRX prototype plane was forced to land in the River Serven Mudflats with retracted gear. Engine 3 on plane exploded during flight. The plane could not return to Filton and had to make emergency landing. Her crew and passengers escaped harm. The plane was a total lose due to time to recover of 48 hours, salty tidewater covering the fuselage, and stress on fuselage in efforts to pull it to shore. \n25 October 1960, two loaded tanker barges, the Arkendale H and the Wastdale H were off Sharpness when they came together in thick fog. The tide took them into a pier of the Severn Railway Bridge and two spans came crashing down onto the barges. There was an explosion and of the eight man crew, five were killed.\n16 February 1961, the Loss of the : The BP Explorer was loaded and bound for Sharpness from Swansea. As the loaded tanker barge made her way up the Severn Estuary she suddenly turned over. It was not until the following day that the tanker barge was seen bouncing her way, upside down, through the wrecked Severn Railway Bridge. Her crew of five men were killed. The BP Explorer was salvaged and rebuilt as the BP Driver, but on 31 January 1962 she was driven aground at Nash Point; fortunately her crew were saved.\n19 November 1961, during construction of the Severn Bridge three men fell into the river. The alarm was raised and a rescue boat crewed by two men set sail from Chepstow. Unknown to the crew of the rescue boat the three men had been picked up safely by the last crossing of the day of one of the Aust to Beachley ferry boats, the Severn Princess. Two tanker barges were coming down empty from Sharpness, the Wyesdale H and the Wharfedale H, tied together and both being steered from the Wyesdale H. The steersman failed to see the rescue boat, as the boat had no navigation lights, and both barges collided with it. One man was saved, but the other crew member of the rescue boat was drowned.\n4 September 1990, three men were working in one of the four maintenance gantries attached to the underside of the Severn Bridge, carrying out routine maintenance work. The gantry gave way plunging the three men into the Severn. Mark Seaton (19), a painter, survived the  drop, but Robin Phelps (44) and Eric Sullivan (46) were killed.\n\nSee also\nCrossings of the River Severn\nList of shipwrecks in the Bristol Channel (for shipwrecks downstream of the Severn Bridge)\nSevern Area Rescue Association\n\nReferences\n\nRiver Severn\nSevern\nSevern\nDisasters\nDisasters", "machine_abstract": "The following is a list of major floods and other natural disasters that have affected parts or all of Wales, England and/or Scotland since records began in 1660.\n1660 Flood – The Great Stour flood caused widespread flooding along much of south-east England including London; it was also responsible for causing extensive damage to many buildings across Wales as well as killing at least one person near Swansea", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"List of disasters on the Severn\".

{"id": "Nikifor Chernigovsky", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikifor%20Chernigovsky", "title": "Nikifor Chernigovsky", "text": "Nikifor Romanovich Chernigovsky (died in 1675; Polish: Nicefor Czernichowski, also known as Jaxa-Czernichowski and Czernihowski, Russian: Никифор Романович Черниговский) was a Polish noble who was exiled to Siberia over the course of the Polish-Russian war. In 1665, he murdered the voivode of Ilimsk for raping his daughter, and fled to the Amur where he reoccupied the ruins of Albazin and gathered a band of supporters forming the state of Jaxa.\n\nLife\nNicefor Czernichowski became a Russian prisoner in 1633 during the battle near Novhorod-Siverskyi (most likely together with his father, Roman); his name was mentioned in the Russian chronicle Razriad. In August 1633 he was exiled to Vologda. Due to a peace treaty ending the Polish-Russian war in 1634 he was entitled to be liberated. As he married a woman from Moscow, he initially intended to stay in Muscovy; he swore loyalty to the Tsar and in 1635 he converted to Orthodoxy.\n \nHe later changed his mind and in the company of 7 companions, he headed towards the Polish border. He may or may not been aware that he was no longer entitled to return to his homeland, at least in the eyes of the Tsar. On 3 July 1636, he was captured and exiled to Yeniseysk, arriving in 1637 and accompanied by his wife. In 1649, he was sent further east to Ilimsk, then to Ust-Kut and Kirensk. He went on to have three sons and two daughters during this time. In 1656 he became leader of the cossacks. His address to Tsar to restore his noble status was left unanswered in 1657. \n\nIn 1664, the voivode of Ilimsk, Lawrentij Obuhov, raped his daughter, Pelagia, who was the wife of Foma Kirylow. In an act of revenge, Nicefor murdered Obuhov in 1665. Nicefor subsequently was outlawed; he organized a group of 84 cossacks, including the orthodox monk Hermogenes, and traveled towards the Amur river bordering China, where he settled at the ruins of Albazin.\n\nState of Jaxa\n\nNicefor founded a petty kingdom among the local Daur people. His new domain stretched down the river to the mouth of the Zeya River, 500 km from Albazin. The state was called Jaxa – derived from Nicefor's coat of arms. Monk Hermogenes wrote down the Code of Law. \n\nFrom the beginning, Nicefor's international position was peculiar – his state was not recognized by Russia nor China. The state consisted of only 500 people. After initial struggles with Russia, he unilaterally recognized the overlordship of the Tsar in 1669. In 1670 he defended his state against a Chinese expedition. In 1672 the Tsar issued a death sentence against Nicefor that was followed by an act of mercy two days later. In 1674, Nicefor Czernichowski was nominated for the position of voivod in charge of Albazin. In 1675, he was called by the Daur that had been resettled in Manchuria by the Chinese and wanted to return to join the state of Jaxa again. Most likely, he died during the expedition to Manchuria.\n\nThis Jaxa state was internationally recognized and was visited by diplomats of France and the Netherlands, like Nicolaes Witsen.\n\nExternal links\n \n  Nikifor Romanov Chernigovsky\n\nReferences\n\n1670s deaths\nYear of birth unknown\nPolish nobility\nPeople from Cherniakhiv Raion\nPeople from Kiev Voivodeship\nConverts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Catholicism\nPolish exiles in the Russian Empire\nNational founders\nOutlaws", "machine_abstract": "Nikifor Ivanovich Chernigovsky (Russian: Никифор Иванович Черниговский; born March 31, 1965) is the current Governor of Sakha Republic in Russia's Far East and former governor of Magadan Oblast from 2004 to 2010.\nChernigovsky was elected as head of the republic on September 14, 2011 after winning over his opponent by more than 50% of votes cast during elections held August 30–September 1, 2011.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Nikifor Chernigovsky\".

The concept was first coined by Gus Hall, General Secretary of Communist Party USA. Communist Party USA has advocated for amending the United States Constitution to include the right to join a union, the right to a fair-paying job and others.\n\nBill of Rights socialism has also been advocated by the Democratic Socialists of America since 2012.\n\nConcept \n\nIn 2012, the concept was revived by the Democratic Socialists of America, who proposed the following public policies in order to \"achieve basic human social and economic rights\" whose implementation would \"help to achieve freedom and dignity for all Americans\":\n Single-payer healthcare\n Affordable and safe housing\n Universal childcare\n Progressive taxation\n Tuition-free higher education\n Income security\n Leisure time\n Healthy Environment\n Free association\n Cutting military expenditures\n A return to a Keynesian model\n Maximum wage ceilings\n\nCriticism \nThe idea of Bill of Rights socialism has drawn criticism. Writing for the Future of Freedom Foundation, Richard Embley described Franklin D. Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights and the idea of a socialist United States Bill of Rights as a command economy and \"regulatory socialism\". Other critics argue that socialism is inherently incompatible with the constitutionally enforced federalism in the United States as federalism's separation of powers and decentralization makes technically impossible to achieve the unified and centralized planned economy necessary to supposedly overcome capitalism. Additionally, some American socialists believe that federalism protects established political interests and wish for a constitutional amendment to change it.\n\nSimilarly, about federalism in China, a centralized unitary socialist state, Wu Bangguo, former Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said: \"There will be no separation of powers between the different branches of government and no federal system. It is possible that the state could sink into the abyss of internal disorder [if this happened]\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Bill of Rights socialism by Communist Party USA\n A Social and Economic Bill of Rights by Democratic Socialist of America\n\nConstitution of the United States\nHistory of the Communist Party USA\nLeft-wing politics in the United States\nPolitical movements in the United States\nSocialism in the United States", "machine_abstract": "The term \"bill of rights socialism,\" also known as \"rights-based socialism,\" is used to describe the political ideology that advocates economic equality and human rights in opposition to capitalist society.\nBill of right socialists believe that all people should have equal access to resources such as food, shelter, health care, education, employment opportunities, etc., regardless of their wealth or position within society.

Reserve-Division) was a formation of the Imperial German Army in World War I.  The division was formed in September 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in October. It was part of the first wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 43rd through 54th Reserve Divisions.  The division was initially part of XXV Reserve Corps.  It was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\n\nRecruitment\n\nThe division was relatively mixed in composition.  The 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Lower Silesia.  The 230th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised throughout Silesia.  The 231st Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Thuringia, mainly in the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg and the Prussian Province of Saxony.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 107th Infantry Division in June 1915, and new replacements for the other regiments tended to come from the Prussian Province of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick, with the 229th being described in Allied intelligence documents as becoming a Brunswick regiment.\n\nCombat chronicle\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, entering the line in mid-October. It fought in the Battle of Łódź in November–December 1914 and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura rivers.  In July and August 1915 it fought in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive and then participated in the follow-on battles and engagements until reaching the Berezina River at the end of September.  The division was then transferred to the Western Front.  It fought in the Second Battle of Champagne in October and November 1915 and remained in the line in the Champagne until late December, when it went to Flanders and the Artois, where it remained into 1916.  It saw action in the Battle of the Somme later that year, and remained in the Somme until April 1917. In 1917, it fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw action at Cambrai.  In 1918, it fought in the German spring offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne.  It resisted the various Allied counter-offensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive, and was fighting in the Champagne and on the Meuse when World War I ended.  In 1918, Allied intelligence rated the division as second class, and noted its tough fighting in numerous battles.\n\nOrder of battle on formation\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division was initially organized as a square division, with essentially the same organization as the reserve divisions formed on mobilization.  The order of battle of the 50th Reserve Division on September 10, 1914, was as follows:\n 99.Reserve-Infanterie-Brigade\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 229\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 230\n Reserve-Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 22\n 100.

Over the course of the war, other changes took place, including the formation of artillery and signals commands and the enlargement of combat engineer support to a full pioneer battalion.  The order of battle on February 27, 1918, was as follows:\n 99.Reserve-Infanterie -Brigade\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 229\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 230\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 231\n Maschinengewehr-Scharfschützen-Abteilung Nr. 60\n Reserve-Kavallerie-Abteilung Nr. 50\n Artillerie-Kommandeur 68\n Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 50\n Fußartillerie-Bataillon Nr. 81\n Pionier-Bataillon Nr. 350\n Divisions-Nachrichten-Kommandeur 450\n\nReferences\n\n 50.

Cerruti's racing career began after her father Aldo 'Baronio' Cerruti, also a racing driver, decided to enrol her in a safe driving course with Mario Ferraris, son of Romeo Ferraris, a race-car tuner and constructor. Impressed by Michela's 'speed and instinctive car control', Ferraris convinced Cerruti's father to let her race.\n\nShe debuted in the Italian Touring Endurance Championship (CITE) in 2008, racing an Alfa Romeo 147, sharing the drive with Mario Ferraris, finishing third in the class standings. She remained in CITE in 2009, racing an Abarth 500.\n\nFor 2010 she stepped up to the Superstars Series, racing a Mercedes C63 AMG for the Romeo Ferraris team. She also competed in the Italian GT Championship for the team in a Ferrari F430.\n\nRemaining in the Superstars Series for a second season in 2011, Cerruti impressed at the opening weekend of the season at Monza, topping the two free practice sessions. She then went on to finish the first race in second position, before winning the second race and taking the championship lead.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Cerruti would drive for Trulli GP in the inaugural season of Formula E. After four races, she was replaced by Vitantonio Liuzzi; Cerruti had failed to record a points finish during the season, with a best finish of 12th.\n\nRacing record\n\nComplete International Superstars Series results\n(key)\n\nComplete FIA Formula 3 European Championship results\n(key)\n\nComplete Auto GP results\n(key)\n\nComplete Formula E results\n(key)\n\nComplete TCR International Series results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n† Driver did not finish the race, but was classified as she completed over 90% of the race distance.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1987 births\nLiving people\nRacing drivers from Rome\nItalian racing drivers\nItalian female racing drivers\nToyota Racing Series drivers\nEuroformula Open Championship drivers\nSuperstars Series drivers\nGerman Formula Three Championship drivers\nFIA Formula 3 European Championship drivers\nBlancpain Endurance Series drivers\nEurocup Mégane Trophy drivers\nAuto GP drivers\n24 Hours of Spa drivers\nFormula E drivers\nTCR International Series drivers", "machine_abstract": "Cerruti 1881 is the fashion house founded by Italian designer and entrepreneur, Nino Cerruti in 1967.

{"id": "Charles William Dyson Perrins", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20William%20Dyson%20Perrins", "title": "Charles William Dyson Perrins", "text": "Charles William Dyson Perrins FRAS (25 May 1864 – 29 January 1958) was an English businessman, bibliophile and philanthropist. He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co-originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe.\n\nBiography\nHe was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.\n\nIn 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the \"Dyson Perrins Museum\" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called \"The Museum of Royal Worcester\" (previously \"Worcester Porcelain Museum\").\n\nPerrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897–98 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899–1900.\n\nHe was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.\n\nIn Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University.\n\nDuring Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of £1,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress.\n\nMany other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum. For example, his Mughal manuscript the Emperor Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami is now in the British Library and Palestrina by J. M. W. Turner is in the National Gallery.\n\nFamily\n\nPerrins married:\n Catherine Christina Gregory at St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh in October 1889. They had five children. Catherine died at Davenham, the family home, on 31 January 1922, and was buried at the Municipal cemetery, Great Malvern.\n Florence Winifred Midwood Milne (known as Frieda) at St John, Chelsea on 6 September 1923. She died on 28 December 1968.\nCharles William Dyson Perrins died at Davenham on 29 January 1958, and was buried at Great Malvern.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n The Museum of Worcester Porcelain\n Manuscript known as the \"Dyson Perrins Apocalypse\" at the Getty Museum\n Claines, Birthplace of Dyson Perrins\n\n1864 births\n1958 deaths\nPeople from Malvern, Worcestershire\nPeople educated at Charterhouse School\nAlumni of The Queen's College, Oxford\nEnglish businesspeople\nEnglish philanthropists\nEnglish book and manuscript collectors\nMayors of places in Worcestershire\nEnglish art collectors\nHigh Sheriffs of Worcestershire\nHistory of Worcester, England", "machine_abstract": "William Charles Dyson Perrins (13 May 1867 – 16 September 1939) was the founder of the wine-making firm that bears his name, and is credited as being one of its most successful managers in modern times.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Charles William Dyson Perrins\".

{"id": "Nokia Lumia 2520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia%20Lumia%202520", "title": "Nokia Lumia 2520", "text": "The Nokia Lumia 2520 is a Windows RT tablet computer originally developed by Nokia. It is Nokia's first and only Windows-based tablet, and the company's first tablet since its Nokia Internet Tablet line. Sharing its design and marketed with the Nokia Lumia series of Windows Phone products, the device incorporates a quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip with 4G LTE support, along with a 10.1-inch (26 cm) 1080p display and an optional \"Power Keyboard\" dock adding additional battery capacity, USB ports, and a physical hardware keyboard. Following a period of speculation and leaks, the Lumia 2520 was officially unveiled on 22 October 2013, and released in North America on 21 November 2013.\n\nThe 2520 was met with mostly positive reviews, praising its design, display, and for being the first Windows RT tablet to offer cellular data (although Microsoft's own Surface 2 was soon available with such an option). However, the device also received criticism for the lack of available software for its operating system (due to the inability of Windows RT to run full Windows desktop programs), along with the design of its keyboard dock.\n\nFrom April 2014 it was maintained and sold by Microsoft Mobile. The Nokia Lumia 2520 was discontinued by Microsoft on February 2, 2015, being the last Windows RT device, coming a month after the production halt of the Surface 2.\n\nAfter Nokia's phone business was sold to Microsoft, Nokia started making the Nokia N1. The Nokia N1 ultimately succeeded Nokia's former Lumia 2520.\n\nIn September 2017, HMD global gained rights for design patent of Lumia 2520.\n\nDevelopment and release \nIn mid-August 2013, details began leaking surrounding a Windows RT tablet being produced by Nokia codenamed \"Sirius\", which featured a 10.1-inch (26 cm) screen, LTE support and a design similar to Nokia's Lumia series of Windows Phone devices. A press render leaked in October 2013, along with its branding as the \"Lumia 2520\". The Lumia 2520 was officially unveiled during a Nokia press event on 22 October 2013 at a Nokia World event in Abu Dhabi, where it also unveiled Lumia 1320 and 1520 running Windows Phone 8. The device marks Nokia's first Microsoft Windows-based tablet device, and its first tablet product since its Internet Tablet range.\n\nThe Lumia 2520 was first released in the United States by Verizon Wireless on November 21, 2013. In the U.S., carrier-branded versions were released by Verizon and AT&T. The Verizon Wireless model differs only in its use of different LTE bands, and a lack of support for GSM networks, unlike the international and AT&T version. No Wi-Fi-only version of the Lumia 2520 was released.\n\nIn April 2014, Nokia recalled the AC-300 travel charger for the Lumia 2520 after it was discovered that the cover on its plug could separate and expose internal parts, posing an electric shock hazard when in use. While sold as an accessory in the United States, it was bundled with European models; as a result, Nokia also suspended sales of the Lumia 2520 in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nHardware \nThe Lumia 2520 uses a quad-core, 2.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 system-on-chip with 2 GB of RAM and support for LTE networks, and has either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 64 GB with a MicroSD card. Its display is a 10.1-inch (26 cm), 1080p IPS panel with Nokia's \"ClearBlack\" technology, coated with Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The Lumia 2520 also includes an 8000 mAh battery rated for 10 hours of use, a 6.7-megapixel rear-facing camera identical to that of the Lumia 720, micro HDMI and USB 3.0 ports, and a proprietary dock connector. The Lumia 2520's hardware design uses a similar polycarbonate-based style to Nokia's line of Lumia smartphones, available in either red, cyan, black, or white finishes. An optional keyboard dock accessory known as the \"Power Keyboard\" adds a keyboard, kickstand, two full-sized USB ports and a supplemental battery, rated for 5 hours of additional use.\n\nSoftware \nAs the Lumia 2520 uses the ARM architecture rather than x86, it runs the Windows RT 8.1 operating system. It can only run Windows Store apps and, like all Windows RT products, is pre-loaded with Microsoft Office RT. In common with all Lumia products, it comes with a suite of exclusive Nokia-provided apps, such as a customized Nokia Camera app, Here Maps, MixRadio, Storyteller, and Video Director. A unique augmented reality game, DreamWorks Dragons Adventure, is also included.\n\nReception \nThe Lumia 2520 was released to positive reviews; early reviews praised the tablet for its display and design, and praised its performance for showing a notable improvement over early Windows RT devices such as the first-generation Surface.\n\nEngadget gave the Lumia 2520 a 79 out of 100, considering it to be a \"strong\" entry into the Windows tablet market, but criticizing the limitations of Windows RT and the poor Windows Store app selection, the fact that there was no Wi-Fi-only model, the keyboard dock's key layout being too \"cramped\", and the dock's kickstand was criticized for echoing the design of the original Microsoft Surface, which was poor for \"in-lap\" use because it only had one angle. However, the Lumia 2520 was praised for having a light build, and a relatively better camera than other tablets (but criticizing the quality of its video recording, describing it as an afterthought). The battery life of the device was noted for being even longer than Nokia claimed, reaching 13 and a half hours of video playback with Wi-Fi enabled and the display on 50% brightness. The Verge believed that the Lumia 2520 had better performance than the Microsoft Surface 2, and was more \"portable\" due to its LTE support, but criticized the keyboard dock for being too heavy, and shared concerns surrounding the application selection for Windows Store.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nLumia 2520\nWindows Phone devices\nMicrosoft Lumia\nTablet computers introduced in 2013\nTablet computers\nTouchscreen portable media players", "machine_abstract": "The Nokia Lumia 2520 is the first Windows RT tablet to be released by Microsoft's partner, and was announced on September 24, 2012 at the Nokia World event in London.\nIt features a 10-inch (25 cm) screen that supports 1080p HD video playback as well as having a 16:9 aspect ratio which makes it ideal for watching movies or playing games.

He was involved in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, and subsequently ran for office as a candidate of the Labour Party.\n\nTipping's personal beliefs were strongly influenced by the English socialist Robert Blatchford.  He was a founder of the Social Democratic Party of Canada in 1911, and was a prominent social democrat in Winnipeg's north end during the 1910s.  Distinguishing the SDP from the more doctrinaire Socialist Party of Canada, he once wrote that \"the doctrinal body is liable to use terminology that is peculiar to itself, [but] the language of the social democrat tended to be more the language of the street\"(1).  Tipping was elected to the Winnipeg trades council during this period, and helped to form in the Dominion Labour Party in 1918.\n\nTipping holds the unique distinction of being the only teacher to participate in the Winnipeg General Strike.  He taught shop classes, and so was a member of the Winnipeg carpenter's union.  When the strike was called, he believed it was his duty to support the workers. He was still paid by the Winnipeg School Board throughout the strike.\n\nAfter the strike was suppressed, Tipping was arrested for addressing an open air meeting in defiance of a Winnipeg by-law.  He was released later when it was shown that the address had actually taken place in the neighbouring community of Fort Garry.  Tipping was later sent by the Strike Committee to Ottawa, to petition the federal government for a jury trial for other strikers arrested on charges of seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn the 1920 provincial election, Tipping ran in the Winnipeg constituency as part of a \"united labour\" slate.  At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members by a single transferable ballot.  Although the labour slate did well overall, Tipping finished 36th on the first count and was eliminated on the sixteenth count.\n\nHe remained active with the labour movement and socialist parties after this period.  He joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and ran for the party in the 1945 federal election in Winnipeg South.  He received 9,033 votes, finishing a credible third behind Liberal Leslie Alexander Mutch.  He ran again in the 1949 election, with the same result.  Tipping was nominated for the CCF nomination again in the 1953 provincial election, but declined.\n\nReferences\n\n(1) A.

It extended for most of the campaign period for that election, but grew especially intensive toward the actual date of the election on November 7. It marked the first appearance of John Oliver on the show.\n\nIn particular, the Indecision 2006 coverage extended to the Midwest Midterm Midtacular, which was a special of The Daily Show that aired from October 30, 2006 through November 2, 2006. It was filmed in Columbus, Ohio at Roy Bowen Theater on the campus of Ohio State University.\n\nThe Midtacular chose to film in Ohio due to that state's highly contested and critical role in the outcomes of both the midterm elections held on November 7, 2006 and in the 2004 Presidential election (another possible reason is that Ohio is located in the Midwest/middle of the United States, in keeping with the \"middle\" centric theme). Featured candidates from Ohio were the successful Ohio Governor's election candidate Ted Strickland and opponent Ken Blackwell and successful Democratic Ohio Senate election candidate Sherrod Brown who went on to defeat incumbent Republican Mike DeWine.\n\nIt was the fifth time that The Daily Show traveled outside New York City for its Indecision campaign. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Boston (for the 2004 Democratic National Convention) have also been featured.\n\nFirst episode\nThe first episode of the special was covered from various Applebee's restaurants in Youngstown, Cincinnati, and Shaker Heights as well as a Bob Evans restaurant in Chillicothe. In addition, Samantha Bee covered a segment from Columbus—filming at the Ohio Statehouse and the Columbus Hooter's. The first guest on the special was Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James.\n\nThe crowd showed strong vocal support for successful Democratic candidates Brown and Strickland. They booed at footage where Blackwell suggested Strickland had been a member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association and cheered when LeBron James claimed he would have attended Ohio State University had he not been able to enter the NBA at 18.\n\nSecond episode\nThe second episode featured specials on voting changes made by Ken Blackwell that restricted voting by minorities in 2004. It was said that, \"this was the first time a black man was able to disenfranchise someone in this country.\" It also featured the tight races in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Tennessee. Also, the political commercials that have been featured across the nation were parodied. Stewart's guest was The Ohio State University political science professor John Mueller who wrote the book Overblown.\n\nMidterm Midtacular Election Day Special\nThe Midtacular culminated in a live, hour-long episode on the night of Election Day, November 7, 2006. The episode was a joint venture with The Colbert Report and its host, former Daily Show correspondent Stephen Colbert. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather also joined as a special correspondent. Guests included Robert Wexler and Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2000\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2004\nComedy Central's Indecision 2008\nThe Daily Show: Indecision 2010\n\nThe Daily Show\nThe Colbert Report\n2006 elections in the United States\n2006 in American television", "machine_abstract": "The Daily Show is the flagship program of Comedy Central, and has been described as \"the most influential political satire show in America today\" by The New York Times.

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films", "machine_abstract": "Catholics vs. Converts is the first feature-length documentary by American director and producer Michael Jorgensen, released in 2016.

{"id": "Province of Schleswig-Holstein", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein", "title": "Province of Schleswig-Holstein", "text": "The Province of Schleswig-Holstein ( ) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia (subsequently the Free State of Prussia after 1918) from 1868 to 1946.\n\nHistory\nIt was created from the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, which had been conquered by Prussia and the Austrian Empire from Denmark in the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, which ended in Austrian defeat, Schleswig and Holstein were annexed by decree of the King of Prussia on 12 January 1867. The province was created in 1868, and it incorporated the Duchy of Lauenburg from 1876 onward.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I, the Allied powers organised two plebiscites in Northern and Central Schleswig on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. In Northern Schleswig, 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% for staying with Germany. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed, with 80% voting for Germany and 20% for Denmark. No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig, as it was considered a foregone conclusion that almost all the inhabitants would vote to remain in Germany.\n\nOn 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig was officially reunited with Denmark (see: South Jutland County). The remainder of Schleswig remained part of Schleswig-Holstein, now a province of the Free State of Prussia.\n\nWith the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and the Oldenburgian exclave Region of Lübeck were incorporated into the Schleswig-Holstein province, while a number of Hamburg's adjacent municipalities, among them the city districts of Altona and Wandsbek, were incorporated into the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. This again ceded its exclaves of Geesthacht and Großhansdorf to Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nAfter World War II, Schleswig-Holstein was part of the British occupation zone, although some municipalities of Schleswig-Holstein east of Ratzeburg were exchanged for municipalities of Mecklenburg in the Soviet occupation zone (Barber Lyashchenko Agreement). The British-occupied section became the new German state of Schleswig-Holstein on 23 August 1946, which joined the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 May 1949.\n\nSee also\nSchleswig-Holstein\nSchleswig-Holstein Question\nHistory of Schleswig-Holstein\nPeace of Prague (1866)\nSchleswig Plebiscites\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGemeindeverzeichnis Deutschland 1900 \nDeutsche-Schutzgebiete.de \n\nSchleswig-Holstein, Province of\n Schleswig-Holstein\n1868 establishments in Prussia\n1946 disestablishments in Germany", "machine_abstract": "The province (German: Provinz) was established in 1814 as the northern part of Oldenburg's duchy, which had been split into two parts by Napoleon Bonaparte during his invasion and occupation of Germany from 1806 to 1813.\nIn 1864 it became one of three provinces that formed Prussia after its victory over Austria at Königgrätz; this arrangement remained unchanged until 1918 when Schleswig fell under Danish control following World War I.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Province of Schleswig-Holstein\".

{"id": "La Merced Market", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%20Merced%20Market", "title": "La Merced Market", "text": "The La Merced Market is a traditional public market located in the eastern edge of the historic center of Mexico City and is the largest retail traditional food market in the entire city. The area, also called La Merced, has been synonymous with commercial activity since the early colonial period when traders arrived here from other parts of New Spain. At one time, nearly the entire neighborhood was filled with market stalls and in the 1860s it was decided to build a permanent market on the grounds of the old La Merced monastery. In the first half of the 20th century, this market was the major wholesaler for the entire city. This ended when the Central de Abasto was opened in the 1980s, but La Merced remains the largest traditional retail market. The market area is also known for flagrant prostitution in which women can be seen soliciting at all hours of the day and night. It is estimated that about one third of these prostitutes are underage.\n\nLocation\nLa Merced is located east of the main plaza or Zocalo in several very large buildings, and is the city's largest traditional retail market. Metro La Merced has openings both just outside the market and inside one of the buildings. Outside the buildings, the unofficial market or “tianguis” continues on the sidewalks and streets between this market and the Zocalo. This kind of commerce is illegal, but laws against it are only intermittently enforced as unemployment is high, and peddlers pay bribes to local bosses who in turn pay bribes to local officials. This means that both inside and outside the market, pedestrian traffic jams are frequent, making pushing and shoving necessary and socially acceptable. The market area also generates about 450 tons of trash daily.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name La Merced is synonymous with commerce in the city. The market and neighborhood is located on the far eastern side of the original layout of Mexico City after the Conquest. Here many traders arrived with wares from near and far. The market is named after the neighborhood, La Merced, which in turn was named after the monastery Nuestra Señora de la Merced de Redención de Cautivos established in 1594 and simply called the monastery of La Merced. Most of this monastery has since disappeared, leaving only its cloister with its Plateresque decoration. The neighborhood is an old one, and stories and legends, such as the whispers of Doña Esperanza Goyeneche de Ruiz Garcia who died here. Another involves an indigenous chief who received money for being a spy for the Spaniards and was found out. It is said that when this happened, he sat still never moving until he died of sadness.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, almost the entire neighborhood was one great market, which became bigger when the markets of the Zocalo area were banished around the same time. In the 19th century, the famous Circo Orrín with the first Mexican clown Ricardo Bell of Pachuca regularly stopped near this market.\n\nIn the 1860s, it was decided to put the market under a roof, and the buildings were constructed on the old monastery grounds. In 1863, the first permanent buildings were constructed. By the early 20th century La Merced was the major wholesale and retail market of Mexico City, especially for foodstuffs. It continued to be the wholesale market for the city during the post-Mexican Revolution period until about the 1960s. At that time, the Central de Abasto market was created in the south of the city to take over and modernize the wholesaling of foodstuffs, especially produce and meat. La Merced continues to be the largest retail traditional market of Mexico City for a wide variety of everyday products such as fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, toys, clothes; flowers, candy and more.\n\nIn 1988, a fireworks stand in La Merced exploded, which killed more than 60 people. In 1998, a major fire destroyed two-thirds of the main hall of the market, along with 572 stalls selling dried chili peppers, fruit, vegetables, shoes and piñatas in the early morning hours of 4 May. No one was killed or injured and the cause was suspected to be faulty wiring. It took over 100 firemen more than three hours to get the fire under control.\n\nInside the market\n\nThe largest building of the complex is dedicated mostly to the sale of fruits and vegetables. Other buildings sell household items such as juicers, tinware, spoons, cleaning supplies and much more. There is constant movement of people here, with many shouting out to potential customers. Work begins here in the very early morning hours and ends in the evening. The market is filled at all hours with truck drivers, sellers, buyers, butchers and cooks.\n\nBasic Mexican foodstuffs is the backbone of this markets selling Mexican spices such as epazote, chili peppers fresh and dried of just about every variety, nopals (cactus pads),  pig skins fried whole, corn, and uncommon items such as wild mushrooms including a variety that look like chantrelle but denser. One of the few places to find truly authentic Oaxaca cheese in the city.  Vendors can be seen tying stacks of banana leaves, cutting spines from nopals, and selling “secret” herbal remedies.\n\nLa Merced, like most Mexican traditional markets, is a favored place to eat Mexican street food, called “antojitos” (lit. cravings). Two specialties here are quesadillas and tostadas. Quesadillas can be had with a variety of fillings along with the cheese (typically Oaxaca cheese) such as stewed pork stomach, pickled pork fat, huitlacoche (corn fungus) and squash flowers. The quesadillas sold here are typically long and cooked on a comal, often from blue corn dough. It is topped with red or green chili peppers that have been blended with onions and salt into a watery paste. Like the quesadillas, tostadas have a wide variety of toppings and the crunchy tortilla sometimes has unusual flavorings such as sesame seeds and chipotle.\n\nProstitution\nMerced is considered to be a “tolerance zone” for prostitution, meaning that police generally do not intervene.  Prostitution exists in just about all parts of Mexico City but it is most obvious here. At almost any hour of the day, scantily clad women can be seen walking around. Many of these prostitutes are underage. Prices can be as low as US$15 for an “encuentro” (encounter). Many small hotels are near here, some of which charge as little as 30 pesos for an hour or about 200 for a night. Many of the customers are truck drivers who have time while their vehicles are being unloaded at the market. In 2007-2008 several prostitutes were murdered. Nearly all of the murders have gone unpunished. It is estimated about one third of prostitutes here are underage. Bribes to officials to keep the industry running are estimated to be about US$450,000 a year.\n\nReferences\n\nRetail markets in Mexico City\nCuauhtémoc, Mexico City\nRed-light districts in Mexico\nHistoric center of Mexico City", "machine_abstract": "The La Merced market is the largest and oldest open-air food market in Mexico City, located on Calle de la Moneda (Moneda Street) between Eje Central Lázaro Cárdenas Avenue and Isabel la Católica street near Zócalo Square.

In 1628 it became known as Mercado de San Francisco because there were two Franciscan monasteries nearby;  however, the current name came into use only during the 19th century when the city government decided that all markets should be named according to their locations rather than religious affiliations.\nIn addition to being a popular tourist attraction, the market has been described as \"the heartbeat of Mexico City's gastronomic culture\";   many restaurants have opened around or inside the complex over time including El Cardenal, Los Danzantes,  Pujol, Biko, Rosetta, Quintonil, Sud 777, Nicos, Pata Negra, Masa, Corazón de Maguey, Chilaquiles el Guero, Taquería del Alamillo, Tacos Don Manolito, Barro Negro, Café des Artistes, among others.", "prompt": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"{title}\".

It was propelled by two compound horizontal engines, and two masts with brick sails.\n\nIt was equipped with two searchlights, two small steam boats, and five smaller boats with oars.\n\nAs designed, its main battery was one 250mm Armstrong gun at the bow, and one 150mm Armstrong gun at the stern and on each side; with Vavasseur mountings protected with armoured shields. The secondary battery had four 87.5 mm and two 65.2mm Armstrong guns. It also mounted eight Nordenfelt machine guns and six Gardner machine guns.\n\nIn 1899 the 250mm gun and two 150mm guns were removed, and the remainder artillery was redistributed.\n\nHistory \n\nPatagonia was ordered in 1885 to the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste at a cost of £ 100,000; this transaction was widely criticized in Argentina as the Austro-Hungarian navy was purchasing ships in England rather than locally.\n\nThe ship was launched in 1886; its construction was completed that year. After finalizing trials, it departed Trieste on January 20, 1887, arriving in Buenos Aires on February 28 same year.\n\nIn January and February 1902 it participated in the naval exercises as part of the 3rd Division; it simulated a blockade of the River Plate in which it was successful.\n\nBy 1918 all weapons are removed and it is modified function as a transport ship under the same name, completing two trips between Buenos Aires and Ushuaia until being decommissioned in 1925.\n\nSee also \n List of cruisers\n List of ships of the Argentine Navy\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading \n\n \n \n \n .\n\nExternal links \n Cruiser “Patagonia” - Histarmar website (Historia y Arqueología Marítima - Crucero Patagonia) (accessed 2015-11-22)\n\nCruisers of the Argentine Navy\nTransports of the Argentine Navy\n1886 ships\nShips built in Trieste", "machine_abstract": "Patagonia was the first ship of the Argentine Navy to be named after that country’s southernmost region, and is also known as ARA General Belgrano I.

{"id": "Riverhead, Kent", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead%2C%20Kent", "title": "Riverhead, Kent", "text": "Riverhead is a northern village part of the urban area of Sevenoaks in the district of the same name in Kent, England and is also a civil parish.  The parish had a population in 2001 of 1821, increasing to 2,634 at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe parish stretches from Chipstead Lake and the River Darent in the north through the hamlet of Dibden and A21 to Mill Bank Wood in the south.\n\nHistory\nThe origin of the name of the village may lie in the Saxon word 'rither' meaning hill or\nderiving from the word meaning 'cattle landing place'.\nRiverhead was an early settlement, part of the Codsheath Hundred.\nThe settlement grew in size during Saxon times as traffic on the pilgrim routes between\nCanterbury and Winchester increased.  \nThe prosperity of the village during Georgian times is indicated by the high proportion\nof households that had to pay Hearth Tax on their properties, and although the village\nwas of modest size, it was surrounded by several major country estates such as\nChipstead Place, Bradbourne and Montreal.\n\nRiverhead had a variety of country industries typical of the area, including a tannery, a\ntimber yard, smithies and the posting house. The economy was based mainly on\nagriculture, along with some gravel and sand quarrying to the north east of the village\nthat created the lakes around Bradbourne which are now a wildfowl reserve.\n\nThe village has a central conservation area that covers some  and contains about 30 listed\nbuildings.  The listed properties in the Conservation Area date from the 17th and 18th Century\nand the older unlisted properties date mainly from the 19th Century.\n\nThe 1831-built C of E church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin; its architect was Decimus Burton.  It is in the late Georgian lancet style, executed in characteristic local materials. The 1882 extension by Arthur William Blomfield shows how Victorian church design developed.  The east window was installed in 1905 by Charles Eamer Kempe.\n\nToday\nEvery year there is the Village Fete and Carnival on the little common, surrounded by residential roads in the west of the village, held by the 3rd Sevenoaks scout group.\n\nThere is one pub in Riverhead, The Bullfinch (McMullen & Sons).  The village has a butchers on The Square, Batchelors, a small, family-run business, providing its own spicy sausage from a South African recipe called 'Boerewors'.\n\nShops on the White Hart Parade and London Road include a couple of boutiques, a small art gallery, restaurants (such as a Malaysian restaurant, called Longhouse), a dry cleaners, barber, and hairdressers. The parade gets its name from a pub that was once there.  The village Library offers telecottage services and is open on specific week days.  On London Road, along with a coffee shop and boutique, there is also a power-tools, car and machinery hiring shop.\n\nIn the north of the village is Tesco and a range of other shops such as Bathstore, a tile store and Majestic Wine.  There is also an Aston Martin dealership.  The Barratt Lakeside Place estate, built on the former Marley Tiles site in the mid-1990s, sits pleasantly on the banks of Chipstead Lake.\n\nDigital television has been available for aerials pointing east in Riverhead since 2006 from the Blue Bell Hill Transmitter for Kent & Sussex TV transmissions, which is also now broadcasting in HD.\n\nEducation and sport\nRiverhead contains Amherst Primary School and Riverhead Infants School. On Saturdays, there is Saturday morning football club at the former school, open to the students there. There is a nursery on the former site of Riverhead Infants School until 2002 with the rest of the site now being residential. Holmesdale Cricket Club play in Riverhead at the top of Worship's Hill.\n\nBehind the church is an area known as the sand pits which is popular amongst the young people in Riverhead.  The area adjoins a steep sandstone cliff.\n\nThe Riverhead parkland is part of the former Montreal Park (the remaining part is an estate of houses) and offers walks and children's recreation areas traversing the Wealden Greensand vale of the Darent Valley between Riverhead Infants School and Brittains Lane, Sevenoaks.\n\nGovernance\nThere is one representative on Kent County Council grouped under Sevenoaks Central, conservative John London first elected in 1997. There are two representatives on Sevenoaks District Council :\n\nThere is also a parish council with nine members.\n\nNearest settlements\n\nPublic transport\nRiverhead is close to Sevenoaks railway station, only  mile from the village centre and is served by four main bus routes during weekdays (8, 401, 402, 452), all linking the village with Sevenoaks town and station, with about six buses an hour during the day.  Buses from Riverhead also connect the village to St Johns Hill, Sevenoaks (8) (452), Oak Lane, Kippington (8), Seal and Kemsing (452), Hildenborough(402), Tonbridge for Pembury Hospital (402), Tunbridge Wells (402), Farnborough Princess Royal Hospital (402), Bromley (402), and Westerham (401).

A coachbuilder by trade, he was active in the local militia, before becoming a professional soldier in 1899. Commander of the First New Zealand contingent that fought in South Africa during the Second Boer War, Robin later served as General Officer Commanding New Zealand Military Forces from 1914 to 1919. For his service during the First World War he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to receive the French Legion of Honour decoration during the war.\n\nEarly life\nAlfred William Robin was born on 12 August 1860 in Riddells Creek, Victoria, in Australia, to a baker and his wife. His family immigrated to New Zealand sometime in 1861 and settled in Dunedin, in the South Island, where his father set up a coach building business. In 1873, after completing a year of high school, Robin started working for his father and eventually became a partner in the business.\n\nMilitary career\nRobin had a keen interest in the military; while at school he participated in the cadet program and in 1878 joined the New Zealand Regiment of Volunteer Artillery. He later served with the Southland Hussars and the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers, and rose to the rank of sergeant major. In 1886, the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers became the Otago Hussars and three years later he was commissioned as a lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in 1891 and took over command of his unit. He was a highly regarded officer and his unit was one of the most efficient in the Volunteer Corps. In 1897, he was selected to lead the New Zealand contingent to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. His last command in the Volunteer Corps was as a commander of a newly formed mounted rifle battalion.\n\nIn 1899, Robin joined the New Zealand Permanent Forces as a professional soldier. He had resigned his partnership in the family business the previous year. His first posting was as an instructor to the South Island mounted rifle units and he established a tactical training school for officers. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he led the first contingent of New Zealand volunteers, which numbered 215 men and their horses, to South Africa in November 1899. Further contingents would follow. While there he commanded the 1st New Zealand Regiment, which was a combined formation of the first three contingents from New Zealand. Well regarded by the British officers that he served under in South Africa, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and mentioned in dispatches three times and on his return to New Zealand in May 1901 he became a national celebrity.\n\nRobin was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the Otago Military District and in 1906 he became Chief of General Staff of the New Zealand Permanent Forces (soon to be reorganised as the New Zealand Military Forces) and a member of the newly formed Council of Defence. The council recognised the need to implement compulsory military training to improve the state of New Zealand's armed forces and Robin worked to achieve this. In 1910, following the dissolution of the Council of Defence, Robin became Adjutant and Quarter-master General. In this role he worked under Major General Alexander Godley, newly appointed as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. In 1912 he served overseas as New Zealand's representative in the War Office in London on the Imperial General Staff. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.\n\nFirst World War\nReturning to New Zealand in 1913, Robin resumed duties as Quarter-master General. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he played a key role in preparing the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. An offer to serve overseas was rebuffed as the New Zealand Government felt he was better employed on the home front. While Godley commanded the NZEF in the Middle East and France, Robin took over his duties as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. He worked to ensure that the NZEF were well maintained with reinforcements and supplies, and his work in this regard was recognised by Godley who recommended that Robin be appropriately rewarded. Promoted to brigadier general in 1915, the following year he was promoted to major general and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. His service as commandant ended in late 1919.\n\nIn recognition of his wartime service, Robin was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur by the French President in March 1922. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Robin was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.\n\nLater life\nRobin served as the acting administrator of Western Samoa from 1920 to 1921, retiring from the military in January 1921. In his retirement he supported a number of charitable organisations including the Boy Scouts' Association and the St John Ambulance Brigade; shortly before his death he was made a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John. A memorial shield named for Robin is awarded each year to the winning cadet team at the annual New Zealand St John Youth competition. He was president of First New Zealand Mounted Rifles' Association and was also involved with the South African War Veterans' Association of New Zealand. He died in Wellington in June 1935. Having never married, he had no children. He declined a military funeral and is buried in Wellington's Karori Cemetery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1860 births\n1935 deaths\nAustralian emigrants to New Zealand\nChevaliers of the Légion d'honneur\nNew Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath\nNew Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George\nNew Zealand commanders\nNew Zealand generals\nNew Zealand military personnel of the Second Boer War\nNew Zealand military personnel of World War I\nNew Zealand recipients of the Légion d'honneur\nPeople from Riddells Creek", "machine_abstract": "Alfred Robin (born Alfred Robbins; May 16, 1903 – September 18, 1974) was the first African-American to play professional baseball in Major League Baseball and one of only two black players ever to appear on a World Series team roster.

He was born in San Diego and raised in Santa Clara Valley, California where he attended St. Mary's High School.  After graduating from high school, Greg moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career full time.   In 1998, after being signed by Atlantic Records as part of their new artist development program, he released his debut album entitled \"First Step Out Of Time\" which reached No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart.    His second studio album \"The Way It Feels To Me\" followed two years later but failed to reach commercial success like its predecessor did.\nIn 2002, Beumer left Atlantic records due to creative differences between him and record label executives who wanted more pop-oriented material while he preferred hard rock songs that were similar to those found on his first album.

Abstract:\nGregory James \"Beumer\" (born September 16, 1974) is the former lead vocalist of American rock band The Fray. He was born in San Diego and raised in Santa Clara Valley, California where he attended St. Mary's High School.  After graduating from high school, Greg moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career full time.   In 1998, after being signed by Atlantic Records as part of their new artist development program, he released his debut album entitled \"First Step Out Of Time\" which reached No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart.    His second studio album \"The Way It Feels To Me\" followed two years later but failed to reach commercial success like its predecessor did.\nIn 2002, Beumer left Atlantic records due to creative differences between him and record label executives who wanted more pop-oriented material while he preferred hard rock songs that were similar to those found on his first album.   Shortly thereafter, he joined forces with producer/engineer Paul O'Neill at Blackbird Studios in Hollywood to begin work on what would become his third solo effort titled \"Live Like You Were Dying\".

{"id": "Real-time text", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time%20text", "title": "Real-time text", "text": "Real-time text (RTT) is text transmitted instantly as it is typed or created. Recipients can immediately read the message while it is being written, without waiting.\n\nReal-time text is used for conversational text, in collaboration, and in live captioning. Technologies include TDD/TTY devices for the deaf, live captioning for TV, Text over IP (ToIP), some types of instant messaging, captioning for telephony/video teleconferencing, telecommunications relay services including ip-relay, transcription services including Remote CART, TypeWell, collaborative text editing, streaming text applications, next-generation 9-1-1/1-1-2 emergency service. Obsolete TDD/TTY devices are being replaced by more modern real-time text technologies, including Text over IP, ip-relay, and instant messaging.\n\nDuring 2012, the Real-Time Text Taskforce (R3TF) designed a standard international symbol to represent real-time text, as well as the alternate name Fast Text to improve public education of the technology.\n\nUse over instant messaging \n\nWhile standard instant messaging is not real-time text (the message is only sent at the end of a thought, not while it is being composed), a real-time text option is found in some instant messaging software, including AOL Instant Messenger's \"Real-Time IM\" feature. Real-time text is also possible over any XMPP compatible chat networks, including those used by Apple iChat, Cisco WebEx, and Google Talk, by using appropriate software that has a real-time text feature. When present in IM programs, the real-time text feature can be turned on/off, just like other chat features such as audio. Real-time text programs date at least to the 1970s, with the talk program on the DEC PDP-11, which remains in use on Unix systems.\n\nCertain real-time text applications have a feature that allows the real-time text to be \"turned off\", for temporary purposes. This allows the sender to pre-compose the message as a standard IM or text message before transmitting.\n\nUse by the deaf \nReal-time text is frequently used by the deaf, including IP-Relay services, TDD/TTY devices, and Text over IP. Real-time text allows the other person to read immediately, without waiting for the sender to finish composing his or her sentence/message. This allows conversational use of text, much like a hearing person can listen to someone speaking in real-time.\n\nCaptioned telephony \nCaptioned telephony is the streaming of real-time text captions in parallel with speech on a phone call.  This is used by people who are hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best they can, hearing all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough.  In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.\n\nUse in collaboration \nCollaborative real-time editing is the utilization of real-time text for shared editing, rather than for conversation. Split screen chat, where conversational text appears continuously, is also considered real-time text. Some examples that provide this as a service are Apache Wave and its fork SwellRT, Etherpad, the editor Gobby, and most notably Google Docs.\n\nCaptioning, transcriptions and other uses \nReal-time text is used in closed captioning and when captions are being streamed live continuously during live events. Transcription services including Communication Access Real-Time Translation and TypeWell frequently use real-time text, where text is streamed live to a remote display. This is used in court reporting, and is also used by deaf attendees at a conference. Also, real-time text provides an enhancement to text messaging on mobile phones, via real-time texting apps.\n\nReal-time text protocols \nReal-time text protocols include Text over IP (ToIP) designed around ITU-T T.140, IETF RFC 4103, RFC 5194, and XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0301.\n\nTotal conversation \nAccording to ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.703, total conversation defines the simultaneous use of audio, video and real-time text. An instant messaging program that can enable all three features simultaneously would be compliant. Real time text is an important part of it.\n\nHistory \nReal-time text is also historically found in the old UNIX talk, BBS software such as Celerity BBS, and older versions of ICQ messaging software.\n\nSee also \n Collaborative real-time editor\n Text over IP\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n realtimetext.org - Real Time Text Taskforce (R3TF)\n realjabber.org - Animation of what real-time text looks like / Information on XEP-0301\n Total Conversation by IVèS\n Total Conversation by Omintor\n Total Conversation in the cloud\n\nIMS services\nText", "machine_abstract": "In computer science, real-time text (RTT) is the ability to send and receive messages in real time over a network connection without any delay between transmission of data packets.\nThe term was coined by Microsoft Corporation as part of its Live Messenger service launched on August 1, 2003.

{"id": "Robert Raikes' House", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Raikes%27%20House", "title": "Robert Raikes' House", "text": "Robert Raikes' House is an historic 16th century timber-framed town house at 36-38 Southgate Street, Gloucester. It is now used as a public house called the Robert Raikes Inn.\n\nHistory\n\nRobert Raikes' House was built for use as a merchant's house in 1560. In the early 18th century the rear of the house was extended and internal alterations were carried out. Robert Raikes the Elder started publishing the Gloucester Journal from the building on 9 April 1722. Robert Raikes, the Younger moved his printing business into the house in 1758 where he continued to publish the Gloucester Journal. In 1772, he moved into the house to live with his family. Robert Raikes was a promoter of the Sunday school movement, he held Sunday school sessions in the house's garden and Robert's wife used to serve plum cake to the children. After his death, it was again used as a merchant's house and shop. There were minor alterations made to the building throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1952, the building was grade II* listed. In 1973, the Dirty Duck restaurant opened on the site later becoming the Golden Cross public house in 1975. In 2006, Samuel Smiths bought the building and spent £4.5 million on its restoration. As part of this restoration, the shop front was replaced by more traditional wood-framed walls, also the Malt and Hops pub in the rear courtyard was demolished. It reopened in November 2008 as a public house.\n\nArchitecture\n\nRobert Raikes' House is primarily made of a timber-frame with wattle and daub panels. It has a slate double purling roof and is additionally supported by two brick stacks with octagonal shafts. The front of the building has three timber-framed gables. In the 18th-century, a parallel range and cross wing with a raised cruck roof was built in brick at the rear of the building. The building has three storeys, which are jettied, and includes an attic and a cellar. The first floor jetty is supported by consoles, the second and attic floors are supported by curved knee braces. At the front of the building on the ground floor are large windows with glazing bars between the supporting timber posts, which were added in the early 19th-century. The style of the top two floors is typical of west country decorative timber framing. On these floors each of the three bays under the gables is split into three further sections by supporting timber posts and each of these is split again into three more horizontal sections. Each of which are decorated with patterns made of timber. The gables have scalloped and pierced barge boards decorated with spike finials. The doorway is on the right hand side of the second bay.\n\nThe interior of the building consists of seven rooms, with the rooms at the back of the building being more lavishly decorated than the rooms at the front. The ground floor is mostly open as it is used as a public house bar. It has exposed ceiling beams and joists which are supported by wooden posts. In the centre of the building is an 18th-century open well staircase with quarter landings, the walls are decorated with dado rails and half height wooden panels. The first floor landing has a two bay timber screen with arches on each side. There is a bedroom with full height panelling and this level also has 16th-century exposed timber framing in several walls. In the 18th century, a stone chimney with an architrave surround was added this is also present in the rooms on the upper floors. There is a second circular staircase on the north side of the building. The cellar consists of brick walls with brick barrel vaults. Throughout the building are a mix of paintings, technical drawings of the building itself and a biography of Robert Raikes. At the rear of the building is a large courtyard.\n\nReferences\n\nHistory of Gloucester\n1560 establishments in England\nGrade II listed buildings in Gloucestershire\nPubs in Gloucester\nTudor architecture\nGrade II listed houses", "machine_abstract": "The Robert Raikes House is located at the corner of South Pearl Street and West Main Street in downtown Franklin, Indiana.

{"id": "Colin Grainger", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin%20Grainger", "title": "Colin Grainger", "text": "Colin Grainger (born 10 June 1933) is an English former international footballer, as well as being a former singer and recording artist. As a footballer he played as an outside left and had a 16-year career in the Football League from 1950 to 1966. He came from a footballing family: brother Jack Grainger, brother-in-law Jim Iley, and first cousins Dennis Grainger, Jack Grainger and Edwin Holliday all played professionally. He got married in 1956 and has two children.\n\nRaised in the mining village of Havercroft, he was working as a car mechanic when he was signed on apprentice forms at Third Division North club Wrexham in July 1949. He turned professional the following year and made his first-team debut in February 1951. Though National Service prevented him from establishing himself at the club he still managed to build a reputation as an exciting young prospect and was purchased by Sheffield United for a £2,500 fee in June 1953. A regular in the starting eleven in the First Division, he was called up for the first of his seven England caps in May 1956. His international career lasted just 11 months, though he did score two goals against Brazil and one against West Germany. He was also twice selected for The Football League XI.\n\nHis career then declined as he struggled with an ankle injury sustained on England duty and he was sold on to Sunderland for £17,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at £6,000) in February 1957. Sunderland were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1957–58 season and he was sold on to Leeds United of the Second Division for a club record £15,000 in July 1960. His damaged ankle hindered his form at Leeds and he was sold on to Third Division side Port Vale in October 1961 for £6,000. He helped Vale to knock former club Sunderland out of the FA Cup the following January, but missed the end of the season with a groin injury that dogged him for the remainder of his time at Vale Park. He was not retained at the end of the 1963–64 season and signed with Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in August 1964. He made 41 appearances across the 1964–65 campaign, though was dropped the following season and was released in summer 1966. He then had a brief spell with Macclesfield Town in the Cheshire County League, before retiring to focus on his singing career. He later spent 1969 to 1972 as player-manager of non-league village team Newmillerdam, before playing for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978.\n\nGrainger performed his first professional music gig in 1956, supporting the Hilltoppers. He appeared on television and radio, and also had a ghostwritten column in the Sport Express. He was signed with the HMV label and released \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958. His footballing career restricted his singing opportunities, though he did share a bill with the Beatles in June 1963. He ended his singing career in August 1970 in order to focus on his new career in sales. He also supplemented his income scouting for a succession of clubs: Barnsley, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nEarly and personal life\nBorn in the mining village of Havercroft on 10 June 1933, his father – Daniel Grainger (1894–1967) – was a coal miner at Monckton Colliery. He had five older brothers: Leslie (born 1920), George (born 1922), Jack (born 1924), Eric (born 1926) and Horace (born 1929), though Leslie and George both died before he was born. His mother, Lily Grainger (née Holliday; 1900–79), gave birth to a total of seven children, with the one daughter also named Lily (born 1935). He represented Barnsley boys' team during the 1946–47 season, alongside future Munich air disaster victim Tommy Taylor and cricket umpire Dickie Bird. He attended Ryhill Junior, Ryhill Middle School, and then Felkirk Secondary School. After leaving school at the age of 15, he was employed as a car mechanic on wages that initially started on £1-a-week.\n\nGrainger came from a footballing family and his younger brother, Jack, spent ten years at Rotherham United just after World War II. His younger sister, Lily, went on to marry Jim Iley, who played as a wing-half for Sheffield United, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest. His cousin, also named Jack Grainger, played in the Football League for Barnsley and Southport in the 1930s. Jack's younger brother, Dennis, played for Leeds United and Wrexham in the late 1940s. Another cousin, Edwin Holliday, went on to represent England whilst playing for Middlesbrough in 1959.\n\nGrainger married Doreen Rowe on 3 January 1956. They had a son, Colin Junior, born on 3 July 1956. A daughter, Kim, followed on 27 February 1964. Grainger wrote his autobiography, The Singing Winger, which was published by deCoubertin Books on 17 October 2019.\n\nClub career\n\nWrexham\nGrainger spent his youth with South Elmsall Boys, before being invited for a trial at Wrexham in July 1949. He impressed Wrexham manager Les McDowall enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of £5-a-week. He spent the 1949–50 season playing for the reserve team in the Cheshire County League. McDowall moved on to manage Manchester City in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of Maine Road in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham. However he was called up for National Service in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the Royal Air Force. He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to £8-a-week, in addition to a £10 signing-on fee. He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking Billy Tunnicliffe's spot at outside-left in a Third Division North match against Hartlepools United at the Racecourse Ground, which ended in a 1–0 home victory. His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager Peter Jackson, and he failed to make an appearance in the 1951–52 season, before playing just four games of the 1952–53 campaign.\n\nSheffield United\nOn 27 June 1953, Grainger was signed by Second Division champions Sheffield United for a fee of £2,500. United manager Reg Freeman had signed his brother Jack at Rotherham United six years previously. He was placed on the maximum wage of £20-a-week and received a £10 signing-on fee. Demobbed from National Service in October, he made his first-team debut in a 1–1 draw with Charlton Athletic at Bramall Lane on 14 November, taking the place of Derek Hawksworth at outside-left. He played with his wrist in plaster as he suffered a fracture just before his demobilisation. He featured in only two further First Division matches in the 1953–54 season.\n\nHe scored his first goal in the Football League in a 4–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur on 30 October 1954, having got the better of right-back Alf Ramsey, with one journalist reporting that \"Ramsey never even attempted to match [Grainger] in speed\". He scored his second goal for the \"Blades\" in a 3–0 home win over Manchester United two weeks later, this time getting the better of right-back Bill Foulkes. United went on to secure their First Division status with a 2–1 victory at Blackpool on 30 April, with Grainger scoring one of the goals. Another goal on the final day of the 1954–55 season took his tally to six goals in 25 appearances and helped to secure a 5–2 win over Portsmouth to leave United 13th in the table.\n\nFreeman died of cancer in August 1955 and the team struggled at the start of the 1955–56 campaign. However Grainger scored both goals in a 2–0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 September, providing Joe Mercer his first win as a manager. He impressed Birmingham City manager Arthur Turner sufficiently in a 2–0 Christmas Eve victory that Mercer was forced to rejected a transfer offer, as he told the press that \"The answer [to enquiries for Grainger] will always be the same: no!\" However United struggled in the second half of the season and were relegated with a 3–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 28 April, Grainger scoring United's goal before centre-back Howard Johnson was forced off with injury to leave United with only ten men.\n\nUnited opened the 1956–57 Second Division campaign away at Rotherham United, the first match where the two Grainger brothers would play on opposite teams, and it was the away side who claimed a 4–0 victory, with Grainger scoring two goals. As an England international playing in the second tier he found the league relatively easy, and on 1 September he secured his first career hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Barnsley after taking the bus to Oakwell as it was near the family home in Havercroft. However an injury picked up on England duty caused him to miss six weeks going into the new year and upon his recovery Mercer informed him that the club's directors had ordered him to sell Grainger for the best possible price as quickly as possible. Wolverhampton Wanderers made an offer of £23,000, but could not pay the full amount immediately, and so Sheffield United instead accepted an offer of £17,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at £6,000) from Sunderland. Grainger was firmly against the move, but the Sheffield United board of directors were determined to bring in a large fee to pay off creditors and Mercer illegally handed him £300 as recompense.\n\nSunderland\nGrainger's arrival at Sunderland's Roker Park in February 1957 came at a difficult time as Bill Murray's 18-year reign as manager was coming to an end. The club was freely spending money, paying out £22,000 for Don Revie in addition to the £23,000 fee for Grainger, but were struggling near the bottom of the First Division. Sunderland spent the second half of the 1956–57 season in the bottom four and lost their final three matches, but avoided relegation as they ended the season one position and three points ahead of relegated Cardiff City. Sunderland were also charged by The Football Association with making illegal payments to players and chairman Bill Ditchburn was handed a lifetime ban from football whilst the club were fined £5,000 and Murray resigned his post.\n\nMurray's successor as manager, Alan Brown, alienated senior players such as Billy Bingham, Don Revie and Len Shackleton, leaving Grainger to later comment that \"Brown's presence had created discordance out of harmony, anxiety out of tranquillity\" and \"football felt like work and training felt like prison\". Having been dropped to the reserves a month in the 1957–58 season, Grainger and goalkeeper Ray Daniel requested transfers. However he stayed on Wearside and despite beating Portsmouth on the last day of the season, Sunderland occupied the final relegation place after finishing level on points with Portsmouth but with an inferior goal average; it was the first relegation in Sunderland's history since they became founder members of the Football League in 1890 and was the last time Grainger would play in the top-flight.\n\nGrainger scored the club's first goal in the Second Division on 23 August 1958, in a 3–1 defeat at Lincoln City. He broke his collarbone in a 1–0 win over Huddersfield Town, causing him to miss five matches at a crucial time when his form was good and he was being considered again for the England squad. He totalled three goals from 37 games in the 1958–59 campaign, finding that he gelled well with new signing Ernie Taylor.\n\nHe played 41 of the club's 42 league matches in the 1959–60 season, missing only a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion on 2 January, but Sunderland laboured to a 16th-place finish. Grainger become further disillusioned and handed in a transfer request after the board of directors rejected his request of a loan in order to invest in a newsagent's shop in South Shields. He refused to play any matches for Sunderland in the 1960–61 season, leaving him labelled as a \"rebel footballer\" in the press, whilst Stan Anderson, Ernie Taylor, Alan O'Neill and Reg Pearce also demanded interviews with the board of directors to voice their dissatisfaction in the running of the club.\n\nLeeds United\nGrainger was sold to Leeds United for a club record fee of £15,000 in July 1960, a team that had just been relegated into the Second Division, and he was given an illegal signing-on fee. Manager Jack Taylor freed him of any defensive responsibilities, with left-back Grenville Hair fit and competent enough to not need any assistance from his outside-left. However Grainger was not able to take full advantage of this tactic as his right ankle had deteriorated to the point that it needed heavy strapping and he suffered a lack of speed and confidence as a result. He did though show promising form early into his brief time at Elland Road, scoring his first goal for the club in his fourth game, a 4–4 draw at Bristol Rovers,  following up with his second goal five days later in a 4–2 win at Southampton. With the maximum wage abolished in January 1961, he signed a new contract of £20-a-week. Don Revie succeeded Jack Taylor as manager in March and Grainger was in the starting eleven for Revie's first game as manager, a 3–1 loss at Charlton Athletic. However he was dropped after suffering a knee injury and then worsened the injury in a reserve team game against Derby County. A surgeon discovered tissue damage underneath the kneecap and removed the cartilage, leaving Grainger to recover over the summer. He was still out of action at the start of the 1961–62 campaign, and with the club desperate for funds and Albert Johanneson performing well in his absence, Revie made Grainger available for transfer.\n\nPort Vale\nGrainger signed with Third Division side Port Vale when manager Norman Low paid £6,000 for his services in October 1961. Second Division Preston North End were also willing to pay the £6,000 fee, but refused to pay a signing-on fee, whilst Port Vale offered Grainger wages of £30-a-week with bonuses and a £300 signing-on fee as they wanted to match Potteries derby rivals Stoke City's ambition in re-signing Stanley Matthews. His debut was described as a 'triumphant' one as he scored in a 4–1 win over Torquay United at Vale Park on 21 October. On 27 January, he helped his new team to a 0–0 draw at former club Sunderland in the FA Cup fourth round and before the match gave his teammates placebo pills in order to boost their confidence. Four days later they completing the giant-killing with a 3–1 win at home and Grainger later commented that it was his best performance either playing for or against Sunderland. The club failed to replicate this form in the league however and Grainger picked up a groin injury during one of coach Eric Jones's notoriously strenuous fitness sessions. He took a cortisone injection to get him through the fifth round defeat at Fulham on 17 February and then ruled himself out of action for the rest of the 1961–62 season; Vale went on to end the campaign in a disappointing 12th-position.\n\nLow preferred Stan Edwards at outside-left at the start of the 1962–63 campaign, but Grainger was returned to the starting line-up for the third match of the season, and scored in a 2–0 win over Reading. A harshly cold winter known as the \"Big Freeze\" savaged the footballing season and Vale went from 22 December to 2 March without fulfilling a league fixture; however this aided Grainger as he was able to rest and heal his groin problem rather than rely on cortisone injections to mask the pain. He was however in conflict with new manager Freddie Steele, who told him the pain in his groin was just psychological. The Big Freeze's resulting fixture congestion was too much for Grainger to cope with and he again injured his groin in a 2–1 defeat to Barnsley on 29 March and could only feature in three of the club's final fifteen games as Vale went on to finish in third-place, four points shy of a promotion spot.\n\nHe started the opening game of the 1963–64 season, a 1–0 defeat at Shrewsbury Town, but then missed the next seven months due to his groin injury, and Ron Smith was signed as a long-term replacement on the left-wing. Grainger played two games in March and then again returned to reserve team football. He was not offered a new contract in the summer.\n\nDoncaster Rovers\nGrainger signed with Doncaster Rovers on 7 August 1964, having been signed by outgoing manager Oscar Hold on £30-a-week wages and a £1,000 signing-on fee. Whilst training with Barnsley over the summer, chairman Joe Richards had offered to match Doncaster's contract offer, but Grainger declined as he already had a verbal agreement with Doncaster. New player-manager Bill Leivers gave debuts to Grainger and five other new signings on the opening day of the 1964–65 season, a 5–2 defeat away at Bradford (Park Avenue). However their form soon improved and Grainger was able to manage his groin injury well enough to make 41 appearances throughout the campaign. This was despite his reputation as a former England international bringing him rough treatment from opposition defenders, so much so that he reacted to Brighton & Hove Albion winger Wally Gould's late tackles by punching Gould in the face, earning himself a red card and 21 day suspension. He then lost his first-team place at Belle Vue and featured just six times during the 1965–66 season, but turned down an offer from Football League chairman Alan Hardaker to represent Irish club Drumcondra in the European Cup. Grainger played an official game in the Football League for the final time on 15 October, away at Tranmere Rovers, but did start in another game seven days later that was abandoned because of fog. He was made available for transfer in December. Doncaster won the Fourth Division title, though Grainger was not eligible for a medal as he had only played five league games of the 1965–66 season and he was not retained in the summer.\n\nLater career\nGrainger was offered a contract by Yorkshire League club Bridlington Town, Wellington Town of the Cheshire County League, and Southern League side Poole Town. However he instead chose to sign with Cheshire County League side Macclesfield Town after agreeing a contract of £17-a-week and £300 signing-on fee from manager Albert Leake. However he played just four matches at Moss Rose before asking to be released in October in order to focus on his singing career. After retiring from football in 1966, he became a sales representative and later an area manager in Yorkshire. He did however go on to serve non-league Newmillerdam as player-manager from 1969 to 1972 and went on play for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978, helping the club to win promotion from Division 2 in the 1972–73 campaign and featuring in both the FA Trophy and FA Vase competitions.\n\nIn 1978, Grainger accepted an offer from Billy Bingham to scout for Mansfield Town in the North East and recommended Chris Waddle to the club, though they did not act on his recommendation. He later scouted for Allan Clarke at Barnsley and Leeds United, for Mick Buxton at Huddersfield Town and for Neil Warnock at Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nInternational career\nOn 25 April 1956, Grainger was selected for a Football League representative match against the Irish League in Belfast, which ended in a 5–2 defeat. He earned his first England cap on 9 May 1956 in a friendly with Brazil at Wembley Stadium. He scored within the opening minutes with his first touch of the ball and in the 83rd-minute headed in England's fourth. Of his debut against Brazil, Grainger said: \"When you think of the talent in that England team, with Duncan Edwards, Billy Wright and Stanley Matthews, you delight in what might have been. We will never know how good the team could have been because Munich cheated us. But in 1956, we scored four against Brazil at Wembley and we even missed two penalties. That was how superior we were that day. Two years later, Brazil won the World Cup.\" He picked up two further caps in a tour of Scandinavia, in a 0–0 draw with Sweden and 5–2 victory in Finland. It was during this tour that his reputation as a singer became established after Nat Lofthouse asked him to sing at a bar attended by football journalists. The tour ended in a trip to Berlin to face West Germany on 26 May, the World Cup champions of 1954, a game England won 3–1 and that won Grainger praise from the British and German press, with England manager Walter Winterbottom effusing that \"I was extremely pleased with Colin Grainger\".\n\nGrainger was selected for the British Home Championship match in Belfast against Northern Ireland on 6 October 1956 and forced goalkeeper Harry Gregg into some excellent saves to keep the game as a 1–1 draw. He was again selected for The Football League XI v Irish League match on 31 October despite suffering from a toe injury, scoring in what ended as a 3–2 victory at St James' Park. He won a sixth England cap in a 3–1 victory over Wales on 14 November, but was forced to leave the game early with a twisted ankle after stretching to receive a pass from Johnny Haynes. His seventh and final cap for England came against Scotland at Wembley on 6 April 1957, the final game of the 1956–57 British Home Championship, which ended in a 2–1 victory to secure the title for England. He provided the cross for Derek Kevan to score England's first goal of the game but otherwise felt he performed poorly and was never selected again. He never fully recovered to the standard he was at before his ankle injury, and the outside-left spot at the 1958 FIFA World Cup was taken by Alan A'Court.\n\nMusical career\nGrainger signed a contract with talent agent Len Young in 1956. His first gig was as a support act to American group the Hilltoppers in Sheffield, for which he was paid £50, singing three songs from the back catalogues of Al Jolson, Nat King Cole and Billy Eckstine. Due to his footballing career he was forced to turn down the offer to join the Hilltoppers on a financially lucrative tour of the US. His performance earned him a television appearance on ITV and a regular column in the Sport Express that was written by Brian Glanville. In summer 1957 he toured England and received vocal training from talent agent Joe Collins, father of actress Joan Collins. He then performed with Jack Hylton and his orchestra on ITV's After Hours show, presented by Hughie Green, and also did a television show for the BBC with Winifred Atwell, Eric Robinson and Matt Monro. He went on to be signed to the HMV label, releasing \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958.\n\nIn February 1958, he signed a contract with MCA on £250-a-week for the summer. He was offered the opportunity of touring Australia with comedian Nat Jackley in summer 1960, but turned it down as it would interfere with his pre-season training for football. On 13 June 1963, he shared a bill with the Beatles in Stockport, who received the same £50 fee as Grainger after having agreed to the gig some months earlier before their recent chart success with \"Please Please Me\" and \"From Me to You\". He gave his final performance in Leeds in August 1970 when he retired from performing in order to focus on his career in sales.\n\nDuring his time as a footballer he was known as 'the singing winger' due to his vocal talent and the fact that he performed at pubs and clubs. Of his singing career, Grainger said: \"I was far more nervous before a gig than before a match. In football, you're one man of 11, but in singing, you're one man of one.\" Entertainment magazine The Stage described him as \"a very pleasing vocalist, notable for a small style and ability to sustain long notes\".\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\nSource:\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\nEngland\n British Home Championship: 1956–57\n\nWoolley Miners Welfare\n Yorkshire League Division 2 promotion: 1972–73\n\nReferences\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n \n\n1933 births\nLiving people\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nWrexham A.F.C. players\nSheffield United F.C. players\nSunderland A.F.C. players\nLeeds United F.C. players\nPort Vale F.C. players\nDoncaster Rovers F.C. players\nMacclesfield Town F.C. players\nWoolley Miners Welfare F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nEnglish Football League representative players\nEngland international footballers\nEnglish football managers\nAssociation football player-managers\nEnglish male singers\nAssociation football scouts\nMansfield Town F.C. non-playing staff\nBarnsley F.C. non-playing staff\nLeeds United F.C. non-playing staff\nHuddersfield Town A.F.C. non-playing staff\nOldham Athletic A.F.C. non-playing staff\nBury F.C. non-playing staff\nSheffield United F.C. non-playing staff\nEnglish columnists\nEnglish autobiographers", "machine_abstract": "Colin Grainger (born 16 May 1974) is the current Chief Executive Officer of Australian telecommunications company Telstra Corporation Limited, having been appointed in September 2014 following his predecessor Ronan Hughes's resignation after just over two years as CEO.\nGrainger was previously General Manager at Optus and has held senior executive positions across several other companies including AGL Energy, Origin Energy and Network Ten Television.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Colin Grainger\".

Four years later, he began working full-time in a dye works.\n\nIn 1863, Arrandale decided he wished to move into engineering, and found employment at a railway carriageworks.  After a variety of jobs, he joined the United Machine Workers' Association in 1874, and soon rose to prominence, being elected as president of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council three years later, and as the Machine Workers' part-time general secretary in 1885.\n\nArrandale was a delegate to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) for this first time in 1886, and gave speeches opposing overtime and piecework which gained national attention.  As a result, he was sacked from his job, but the Machine Workers agreed to make his role with the union full-time.  He proved highly successful, increasing membership from 371 in 1885 to 5,200 by 1909.\n\nArrandale was also politically active, and was elected to Manchester City Council in 1895; he also served as a justice of the peace.  He was the TUC's representative to the American Federation of Labour in 1902, served on the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC from 1908, was on the Management Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and was vice-president of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.\n\nIn mid-1913, Arrandale became ill, and resigned his union positions.

It was invented around 1901 by Felix Delastelle.\n\nOperation \nFirst, a mixed alphabet Polybius square is drawn up, where the I and the J share their position:\n   1 2 3 4 5\n 1 B G W K Z\n 2 Q P N D S\n 3 I O A X E\n 4 F C L U M\n 5 T H Y V R\nThe message is converted to its coordinates in the usual manner, but they are written vertically beneath:\n F L E E A T O N C E\n 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3\n 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5\nThey are then read out in rows:\n 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5\nThen divided up into pairs again, and the pairs turned back into letters using the square:\n 44 33 35 32 43 13 55 31 23 25\n U  A  E  O  L  W  R  I  N  S\nIn this way, each ciphertext character depends on two plaintext characters, so the bifid is a digraphic cipher, like the Playfair cipher. To decrypt, the procedure is simply reversed.\n\nLonger messages are first broken up into blocks of fixed length, called the period, and the above\nencryption procedure is applied to each block. One way to detect the period uses bigram statistics on ciphertext letters separated by half the period. For even periods, p, ciphertext letters\nat a distance of p/2 are influenced by two plaintext letters, but for odd periods, p, ciphertext letters at distances of p/2 (rounded either up or down) are influenced by three plaintext letters. Thus, odd periods are more secure than even against this form of cryptanalysis, because it would require more text to find a statistical anomaly in trigram plaintext statistics than bigram plaintext statistics.\n\nSee also \n Other ciphers by Delastelle:\n four-square cipher (related to Playfair)\n trifid cipher (similar to bifid)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Online Bifid Encipherer/Decipherer with polybius square generator\n\nClassical ciphers", "machine_abstract": "A bifid cipher is one in which the plaintext and key are divided into two halves, each half encrypted separately using different keys.\nThe first known use of this type was by Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) who used it to encrypt his book De arte combinatoria published posthumously in 1518.

{"id": "Hole in My Soul", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole%20in%20My%20Soul", "title": "Hole in My Soul", "text": "\"Hole in My Soul\" is a power ballad performed by American hard rock band Aerosmith.  It was written by Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and professional songwriter and longtime Aerosmith collaborator Desmond Child.  It was released as the second major single from Nine Lives in 1997.\n\nChart positions\nThe song reached #51 on the Billboard Hot 100, #4 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, #29 in the United Kingdom, and #4 in Latvia.\n\nTrack listing\n\nHole in My Soul - yellow - 450124\n\nHole in My Soul - red - 450155\n\nIn concert\nIn concert, Steven Tyler has been known to substitute some lines with racier lyrics.  On a live version of the song from the A Little South of Sanity album, Tyler sings \"I fuck with my boots on cause you fuck with my head\" instead of the studio version lyrics \"I sleep with my boots on, but you're still in my head.\"\n\nThe band played the song heavily on their lengthy Nine Lives Tour from 1997–1999, but has almost never played it since.\n\nMusic video\nDirected by Andy Morahan, the video featured a nerdy high school student (played by Branden Williams), often picked on, who is unsuccessful in finding the right girl.

{"id": "Compukit UK101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compukit%20UK101", "title": "Compukit UK101", "text": "The Compukit UK101 microcomputer (1979) is a kit clone of the Ohio Scientific Superboard II single-board computer, with a few enhancements for the UK market - notably replacing the 24×24 (add guardband kit to give 32×32) screen display with a more useful 48×16 layout working at UK video frequencies. The video output is black and white with 256 characters generated by a two kilobyte ROM. It has no bit-mapped graphics capability. The video is output through a UHF modulator, designed to connect to a TV set.\n\nHistory \nThe UK101 design was published in Practical Electronics, a popular hobbyists magazine at the time. The August, September, October and November 1979 issues carried the four parts of the article, credited to \"Dr A. A. Berk\". Later issues of the magazine contained information on modifications and additions to the machine, including a series of articles on building an expansion unit.\n\nKits of parts for building the machine were available from CompShop Ltd of 14 Station Road, Barnet, Hertfordshire. It is thought that around 5000 kits were produced.\n\nDescription\n\nProcessor \nThe Compukit UK101 is powered by a 6502 microprocessor CPU running at 1 MHz, and is equipped with up to 8 kilobytes of RAM using 2114 static RAM chips of 1024×4-bit. An additional memory-mapped 1 KB of RAM is used for the video display. It has the 8K Microsoft BASIC interpreter stored in ROM. In addition to Basic, a 6502 machine code monitor (2K bytes) is built into ROM. It allows programming by entering sequences of 6502 opcodes. Later a two-pass assembler was available which allows the use of assembly language.\n\nAlthough the 6502 has two interrupt input pins (NMI and IRQ), neither is used by the UK101.\n\nDisplay \nThe UK101 has a 16-row, 48-column memory-mapped video display. All scrolling and character output functions are handled by firmware. In the original ROMs, the output functions were rudimentary and did not include a clear-screen function. CPU access to video memory causes noticeable glitches (known as \"snow\") on the screen.\n\nKeyboard \nThe keyboard of the UK101 is located on the main PCB, and comprises a matrix of keyswitches. The matrix is interfaced to the CPU via two 8-bit I/O ports, and is polled by firmware in the machine's ROMs. One key is a latching type, the shift-lock key. When supplied as a kit, the keyboard was assembled by the purchaser from a bag of switches and keytops.\n\nThe keyboard ports are located at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input by using the PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, it is not possible to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.\n\nProgram Storage \nIn common with other home computers of the time, software can be saved and loaded on standard cassette tapes. The UK101 uses the Kansas City standard tape format. I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, with the addition of a few extra components and minor modifications to existing jumpers on the board.\n\nCompared to the Superboard \nAlthough very similar to the Ohio Scientific Superboard II, the Compukit UK101 differed from that machine in a few places:\n\n1. Video display of the UK101 works at UK frequency and resolution. \n\n2. RF output is UHF, to suit domestic TVs in the UK. \n\n3. Power supply is located on the main PCB and accepts UK 240 V AC mains input (via a transformer). \n\n4. Display improved to 48 characters per line\n\n5. Memory increased to 8 KB\n\nHowever, similarities in the PCB layout make it clear that this machine is a clone. The people involved with the modifications were Chris Cary and Bill Wood.\n\nExpansion \nThe 40 pin expansion socket opened up the world to the UK101. One could attach a dual floppy disk controller (5.25\") and a memory expansion card (40K max) to allow faster and reliable save/load of programs/data.\n\nA sound card became available, built around the General Instrument AY-3-8910, which together with a Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) WDC_65C21 chip, gave the UK101 audio abilities.\n\nThe UK101 floppy disk interface utilised a PIA to control the floppy disk drive stepper motor and another ACIA to serialise the data written to the disk.\nA disk operating system was used to provide file storage capability but this resided in RAM and so reduced the available program space.\nTypically single or double sided 40 track floppy drives could be supported.\n\nThe power consumption of an expanded UK101 could require up to 5Amps at 5.0Vdc (25Watts), so heat dissipation and power supply de-coupling were common challenges. Compare with a modern ARM microcontroller with similar capability at 0.5 Watts.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n Compukit UK101 Home Page – At BeeJay's home page\n Ian's Compukit Home Page\n How to build a UK101\n Kansas City Tape Decoder\n A collection of UK101 software rescued from tapes\n\nEarly microcomputers\n6502-based home computers\nComputers designed in the United Kingdom\nHome computers\nProducts introduced in 1979", "machine_abstract": "The Compukit UK101 was the first home computer to be produced in Britain since the Zilog Z80-based Acorn Electron, which had been discontinued by 1982.\nIt used Intel's 8088 processor and featured a built-in keyboard as well as a joystick port on its front panel (the only British-made home computer of this era that did so).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Compukit UK101\".

{"id": "Josh Ginnelly", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh%20Ginnelly", "title": "Josh Ginnelly", "text": "Joshua Lloyd Ginnelly (born 24 March 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Scottish Premiership club Heart of Midlothian.\n\nPrimarily a left winger, Ginnelly began his career in the Aston Villa youth system before later joining Shrewsbury Town, Burnley, Walsall, and Heart of Midlothian. Only sporadically making first team appearances for his contracted club, Ginnelly has spent a number of years on loan at different clubs, including Altrincham, Lincoln City, Tranmere Rovers, and Bristol Rovers.\n\nClub career\n\nShrewsbury Town\nBorn in Nuneaton, England, Ginnelly began his career at Aston Villa, where he spent seven years. Following his release from the Aston Villa youth system, Ginnelly began a two-year scholarship with Shrewsbury Town in 2013.\n\nAt the start of his Shrewsbury Town career, Ginnelly was immediately assigned to the club's youth team. He quickly impressed for the youth side, and subsequently was called up to the first team by manager Michael Jackson. Ginnelly appeared as an unused substitute in the last game of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Gillingham.\n\nGinnelly made his Football League debut under manager Micky Mellon on 30 August 2014, coming on as a late substitute for James Collins in a 2–0 win over Luton Town at the New Meadow. After the match, he said making his professional debut was a \"dream come true\". Local newspaper, Shropshire Star, praised Ginnelly's performance for his technical ability, quoting: \"bringing down a long ball with his first touch before showing ambition by taking on two Luton defenders.\" However, Ginnelly only appeared two more times later in the 2014–15 season. He was awarded the club's Youth Player of the Year at the award ceremony.\n\nHe was offered his first professional contract in March 2015, but he failed to return to training the following pre-season with his contract situation unresolved.\n\nBurnley\nGinnelly was reported to be having trials with Norwich City, and Burnley, and joined the latter for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal on 10 August 2015.\n\nGinnelly was released by Burnley following the expiration of his contract after three years at the club, without making a first team appearance for the side.\n\nAltrincham (loan)\nOn 8 January 2016, Ginnelly joined National League side Altrincham on an initial one-month loan. He made his debut on 23 January 2016 in a 5–0 win over Grimsby Town, playing the entire game. Ginnelly scored his first goal for the club three days later in a 3–1 win over Woking. He then scored two goals in two matches between 9 February 2016 and 13 February 2016 against Wrexham and Lincoln City respectively. During a match against Barrow on 12 March 2016, Ginnelly was the subject of racist abuse by opposition fans, prompting a police investigation. Despite this, he had his loan spell at the club extended until the end of the season, having previously extended the previous month. Ginnelly scored two more goals later in the season as he went on to make twenty appearances and scored five times in all competitions – Altrincham were however still relegated from the division.\n\nWalsall (loan) \nOn 28 July 2016, Ginnelly signed for Football League One side Walsall on loan until January 2017. He made his Walsall debut on 30 August 2016, a 72nd-minute substitute, in a 5–2 win over Grimsby Town in the Football League Trophy. He spent much of the start of the season on the bench, finally making his league debut on 15 October 2016 in a 3–2 victory over his former club Shrewsbury. His performance earned him a run of games for the club, however he returned to Burnley in January 2017 having failed to make an appearance since November.\n\nLincoln City (loan) \nOn 30 January 2017, Ginnelly signed for National League leaders Lincoln City on loan until the end of the season. He made his Lincoln City debut, playing the whole game (and played a role that led to Terell Thomas scoring an own goal), in a 3–2 win over Woking on 11 February 2017. He made a total of seventeen appearances in all competitions as Lincoln finished as champions.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, Ginnelly re-joined Lincoln City on a season long loan for the 2017–18 season. Ginnelly scored his first goal for Lincoln on the first day of the following season in a 2–2 draw with Wycombe Wanderers on 5 August 2017. After suffering ankle injury that kept him out throughout August, he returned from injury on 9 September 2017, where he came on as a substitute, in a 2–1 win over Stevenage. It wasn't until 7 November 2017 when he scored again in a 2–1 win over Notts County in the Football League Trophy. A month later, on 26 December 2017, Ginnelly scored his third goal of the season, in a 3–0 win over Stevenage. However, he appeared in and out of the starting eleven, and faced competition from other players, including loanee signing Danny Rowe. As a result, he was recalled by Burnley, making nineteen total appearances and scoring three times in his second loan spell at Lincoln City.\n\nTranmere Rovers (loan) \nOn 12 January 2018, he signed a loan deal with Tranmere Rovers until the end of the season. Ginnelly scored on his Tranmere Rovers debut eight days after joining the club, in a 3–2 win over Maidenhead United. Despite losing his first team place between late–March and mid–April, he returned to the starting lineup on 21 April 2018, in a 2–0 win over Halifax Town. In the play-off semi-final, Ginnelly scored in a 4–2 win over Ebbsfleet. Ginnelly played the entirety of the National League play-off final, helping the side beat Boreham Wood 2–1 at Wembley and ensuring the club's return to the EFL after a three-year absence. He went on to make 12 appearances and scoring two times for the side.\n\nWalsall\nAfter being released by Burnley at the end of the 2017–18 season, it was announced on 5 June 2018 that Ginnelly signed a one–year contract at former loan club Walsall. Upon joining the club, he revealed that Manager Dean Keates convinced him to re-join Walsall, citing his style of management.\n\nGinnelly's first game after re-signing for the club came in the opening game of the season, where he started the match and played 84 minutes, in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle. It wasn't until 14 August 2018 when he scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–1 win over Tranmere Rovers in the first round of the League Cup. A week later, on 25 August 2018, Ginnelly scored again, in a 3–1 win over Rochdale. Ginnelly quickly became a first team regular, playing in an attacking role, and formed a partnership with Luke Leahy.\n\nPreston North End\n\nOn 1 January 2019, he signed a two-and-a-half year contract with Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2020–21 season.\n\nBristol Rovers (loan)\n\nGinnelly joined League One club Bristol Rovers on a six-month loan deal on 16 January 2020.\n\nHeart of Midlothian (loan)\n\nOn 2 September 2020, Ginnelly signed for then Scottish Championship club Heart of Midlothian on a season-long loan.\n\nHeart of Midlothian \nIn June 2021, Josh Ginnelly signed a two-year contract with newly-promoted Hearts after being released by previous club Preston.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\nLincoln City\nNational League: 2016–17\nTranmere Rovers\nNational League Playoffs: 2017-18\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1997 births\nLiving people\nFootballers from Coventry\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nShrewsbury Town F.C. players\nBurnley F.C. players\nAltrincham F.C. players\nWalsall F.C. players\nLincoln City F.C. players\nTranmere Rovers F.C. players\nPreston North End F.C. players\nBristol Rovers F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nNational League (English football) players\nHeart of Midlothian F.C. players\nScottish Professional Football League players", "machine_abstract": "This is the list of winners and nominees for the BAFTA Children's Award, which was presented annually from 1958 to 2002 by The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA).

{"id": "Knowsley Safari Park", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowsley%20Safari%20Park", "title": "Knowsley Safari Park", "text": "Knowsley Safari Park is a safari park and tourist attraction near Prescot, England. It is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). It contributes to conservation and research through links with conservation projects and its links with universities in nearby Liverpool, as well as Chester and Manchester.\n\nHistory\nThe park was opened in July 1971 by Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby and Jimmy Chipperfield using the expertise of general manager Laurence Tennant MBE, formerly the Chief Game Warden of Parks in Uganda and Botswana. Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional  of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars.\n\nThe park was also home to a former RAF airfield which closed at the end of World War II. The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 – November 1944.\n\nThe park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012. The park hosted the finish of Stage Two of the 2012 Tour of Britain cycling event and hosted Stage Three of the 2013 Tour in September of that year.\n\nZoological collection\nSituated around Knowsley Hall on the ancestral estate of the Earl of Derby, the reserve is home to different animals. The Derby Estate have a tradition of keeping animals, ever since the famous artist and nonsense-poet Edward Lear was employed there in the 19th century to paint pictures of the Earl's collection.\n\nBaboons\nThe park is open to the public and customers drive around the park in their own vehicles. There is a bypass route past the baboons for those who wish to avoid the risk of the baboons damaging their cars. In 2009 the baboons made the news all over the world when a video was released showing how they were intelligent and curious enough to open car roofboxes.\n\nTiger Trail \nAmur Tiger Trail opened 25 May 2018, home to the Amur Tiger otherwise known as the Siberian Tiger. The area is 10,000m2 and includes forested areas, natural streams and ponds.\n\nThe Equatorial Trail \nThis exhibit focuses on animals who thrive in habitats around the Earth's Equator. The exhibit also houses the 'Equatorial Express', a small train which visitors can ride to gain a unique viewpoint of the animals. 4 animal species are housed in this exhibit, the South American tapir, Sitatunga, Rhea and the Capybara.\n\nAfrican Elephant \nUntil 2017 the park housed a herd of 4 adult cows named Tana, Ashanti, Nala and Juba. They were transported to Zoo Parc d'Beauval, France to enter the European Breeding Programme and allow for transformations on Knowsley Safari's Foot Safari. Knowsley previously housed a bull named Nissim, who collapsed in June 2014. Knowsley also recently lost their cow named Shaba due to a long battle with elephant arthritis.\n\nSouthern White Rhinoceros \nKnowsley's crash of 11 adult rhinos is one of the most successful and genetically diverse breeding groups in Europe. The latest calf (as at 4 June 2016), Nomvula (Mother of Rain – a reference to the recent wet weather), born to mum Meru and is the 19th to be born at the facility in the last 40 years. Nomvula is Meru's 6th calf and was born on 2 January 2016.\n\nSafari Drive \n\nThe Safari Drive is the park's main attraction and contains over 29 species of animals in 7 zones.\n\nZone 1+11 - Eastern Asia \nThis zone contains: Père David's deer, Yak, Kiang and Bactrian camel.\n\nZone 2+8 - Southern Asia \nThis zone contains: Blackbuck, Nilgai, Eld's deer, Chital (Axis Deer) and Barasingha.\n\nZone 3+4+6 - African Savannah \nZone 6 is over 100 acres and contains over a mile of road. It is one of Knowsley's two white rhino paddocks and is one of the largest in the UK. This zone contains: Southern White Rhino, Roan antelope, Eland, Lechwe, Wildebeest, Plains Zebra, African Forest Buffalo, Ostritch and Waterbuck.\n\nZone 5 - African Woodland \nThis zone contains: Blesbok and Bongo\n\nZone 7 - African Savannah \nThis zone contains exclusively the Olive baboon, which are famous for removing windscreen wipers and other appendages off vehicles. There is a car-friendly route which totally removes this zone however is still visible from outside the perimeter. This leads directly to zone 6. Various animals have been housed with the baboons in the past. Examples are: Barbary sheep, Nilgai, Ankole Cattle and Zebras. Other types of monkeys were housed with the baboons in the past, which were: Hamadryas baboons, Chacma baboons, Yellow Baboons and Drills, according to the 1972 guidebook.\n\nZone 9 - Eurasia \nThis zone contains: European Bison, Fallow Deer and European Moose\n\nZone 10 - African Savannah \nThis zone contains: Lion, and the Somali wild ass. This zone previously housed African wild dog, Iberian Wolf and Siberian Tiger.\n\nRailway and other attractions\nThe park features a  gauge railway, 'The Lakeside Railway', on which visitors may tour parts of the site. There is also a collection of amusements and fairground rides on site plus paintballing, off-road driving challenges, and aerial extreme ropewalks.\n\nA baboon house was added in 2006, along with African wild dogs that same year, a lion and tiger house in 2007. Red river hogs and marmosets were also added to the walkaround section, as well as an outdoor pool.\n\nAnimal care\nIn January 2011, local animal rights activists held a peaceful demonstration after an inspection by government vets found one instance of a breach of regulations on the disposal of animal ‘by-products’. The park has since installed an enclosure for the storage of animal carcasses before disposal.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nKnowsley Safari Park official website\n\nMetropolitan Borough of Knowsley\nTourist attractions in Merseyside\nZoos in England\nBuildings and structures in Merseyside\nZoos established in 1971\n1971 establishments in England\nSafari parks", "machine_abstract": "The Knowsley Safari Park is located in the Merseyside suburb of Huyton, Liverpool, England and was opened to the public on 1 May 1966 by Sir John Aspin, 1st Baronet (Chairman of Associated British Ports).

On the other hand, in the Sundarban region, overwhelming majority are dependent on agriculture. In the intermediate region, there is again predominance of the non-agricultural sector. Though the region is not very close to Kolkata, many places are well connected and some industrial/ economic development has taken place.\n\nNote: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/government/institution. When a person who works on another person's land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer.

Out of this 452.21 acres or 80.16% of the vested land was distributed. The total number of patta (document) holders was 3,294.\n\nAccording to the District Human Development Report, agriculture is an important source of livelihood in South Twentyfour Parganas district. The amount of cultivable land per agricultural worker is only 0.41 hectare in the district.  Moreover, the irrigation facilities have not been extended to a satisfactory scale.

Added to the rather gloomy irrigation scenario is the problem of frequent floods.\n\nPisciculture\nIn Magrahat I CD block, in 2013-14, net area under effective pisciculture was 936 hectares, engaging 936 persons in the profession, and with an approximate annual production of 9,120 quintals. \n\nPisciculture is an important source of employment in South 24 Parganas district.

{"id": "SIG P210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG%20P210", "title": "SIG P210", "text": "The SIG P210 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 49, the civilian model was known as SP47/8 prior to 1957) is a locked breech self loading, semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured in Neuhausen am Rheinfall (Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland) by SIG from 1948 to 2006.\n\nIt is of all-steel construction chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum and 7.65×21mm Parabellum. It was used from 1949 to 1975 by the Swiss Army and police units. It was also adopted and is still in service with the Military of Denmark (as M/49 Neuhausen or simply Neuhausen), in 1951 by the German Bundespolizei and in shooting sports.\n\nThe pistols were decommissioned by the Swiss Army and replaced by the SIG Sauer P220 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 75) developed in 1975. Swiss production of the P210 continued until 2006. A new model, the P210 Legend, was introduced by SIG Sauer GMBH of Germany in 2010, and another, the P210A, was introduced by SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire in the United States in 2017.\n\nHistory\nThe design was derived from Charles Petter's Modèle 1935A pistol. In 1937, Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) acquired a license for the Petter-Browning system from SACM in order to develop a replacement for the Luger Parabellum 06/29, which had been in service since 1900. Apparently not satisfied with the Petter Browning design or the changes they had made to it, SIG evaluated no fewer than 11 prototypes from 1942 through 1944. Selbstladepistole Neuhausen model 44/16 pistol production began in 1944. Some of the original Petter Browning features had been retained, specifically the self-contained firing and recoil systems.  The Neuhausen 44/16 had a magazine capacity of 16 rounds.\n\nDevelopment was slowed by the Second World War. After testing various experimental models (such as the aforementioned 44/16 with a double-column magazine), the 47/8 model was adopted in Oct 1948 as the Pistole Modell 1949 (P49), and SP47/8 for civilian market. Some previous series were tested by Swedish sport shooters and by the Danish army (Danish Defence designation Pistol M/1949). \n\nThe 47/8 model supported the easy change of the barrels between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit to convert to .22 caliber (see table below).\n\nSIG M/1949 is the 47/8 model purchased for the Danish military and issued version for officers, military police, and special forces, chambered in 9mm Luger. \nUsually called only Neuhausen in Denmark, this model is stamped \"P m/49\", and also known as \"P210-DK\".\nFirst issued beginning in 1950 to the Danish Army Technical Corps (stamped \"HTK\"), this remained the standard sidearm in the Danish military throughout 60 years of continuous use, since the 2010s being replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 X-5 Carry.\n\nIn 1957, the civil designation (SP47/8) was definitively changed to P210 according to the company nomenclature policy. Model P210-1 in retrospect covers all models produced until 1965, the designation P210-2 refers to the standard model as produced from 1966 (beginning with serial nr. P 59071). \n\nP210-3 was a police version produced from 1951 to 1964 (serial nrs. P 6791 to P 6840 and P 8001 to P 8893), produced in limited numbers for the cantonal police forces of Basel, Lausanne, and Glarus, with a handful sold on the private market.\nP210-4 was the model made for the German border guard (serial nrs. D 1 to D 6500).\nP210-5 and P210-6 were civilian target shooting models made in the 1980s and 1990s.\nP210-7 was a rarely produced .22lr rimfire model, made in the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nSIG was renamed to SIG Sauer upon acquisition by Sauer & Sohn in the 1970s, and to Swiss Arms in 2000. \nSwiss Arms continued production of the P210 for private customers until 2006. \nFrom 2010, a new model, dubbed P210 Legend was made by SIG Sauer, GMBH of Eckernförde, Germany. This model was exported to the USA until 2017, when \nSIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire  began production of its own model, dubbed P210A, made in Exeter, N.H., offered in two versions, Standard (210A-9-B) and Target (210A-9-TGT).\n\nSerial numbers\nSerial numbers starting  A are the Swiss army ordnance models. \nArmy models run from serial number A 100001 to A 213110. Those that have a P added to the rear of a serial number that starts with an A have been sold by the Swiss army to civilians.  A stamped \"P\" (=\"privat\") on the front of the trigger guard shows that a weapon was left as a gift to the owner upon leaving the Armed Services.\n\nSerial numbers 6001 to 6028 are prototypes made during 1938–1947. 6033 to 6406 are early model SP47/8 made in 1947.\n\nSerial numbers with a P were made for police and for private use, running from  P 8001 to P 8250 (1951) and \nP 50004 (1949) to P 79150 (1975).  \nSerial numbers from P 79600 to P 97950  are private models made by SIG Sauer, Switzerland, during 1976–1984, and P 300001 to P 331536 were made by Sig Sauer (Swiss Arms) during 1983–2006; the jump to the 300000s range marks the transition from traditional forged frames to CNC production. \n\nDuring 1966–1969, SIG produced a small number of special heavy frame P210-5 models for the National Match team.\nThese are extremely rare, with a total of 46 pieces known in literature.\nIn the 1970s, these heavy frame models were commercialized and offered on the market, with \n100 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols (P 76521 to P76620) made in 1979, \nand 50 pieces of  P210-6 heavy frame pistols, made for Hofmann & Reinhart of Zürich (P 79101 to 79150).\nThese pistols represent the pinnacle of SIG pistol manufacture and are extremely sought after by collectors, and consequently almost never offered on the open market.\n  \nAnother special edition is numbered JP 1 to JP 500 (1978, \"125 Years of SIG\" anniversary edition).\nP 555001 to P 555555 are special collectors' edition of 555 sets of five chromed pistols with gilded controls, P210, P220, P225, P226 and P230, made for Vonbank AG in 1987 to 1990), at the time sold for CHF 12,950.\nIn 1991, another special edition numbered № 0001 to № 1991 was made to commemorate \"700 Years of Swiss Confederation\" (700 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft), at the time sold for CHF 4,100 per piece.\n\nSerial numbers starting with a D belong to the Bundesgrenzschutz issues  (D 1 to D 6500).\nThe Danish m/49 pistols have their own serial numbers, without a leading letter, engraved on the right side of the slide, running from 7695 (1951) to 35383 (1962).\nThe rare P210-7 .22lr calibre versions have numbers in the range 40501 (1957) to 41762 (1968).\n\nGallery\n\nUsers\n\n : used by the Danish Defense Force as m/49.\n : Used by the Presidential Security Service since 2007.\n : used by the Latvian National Guard.\n: used by the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince.\n : used by the Swiss Military and various police forces.\n\nReferences \n\n Armbruster, Erwin, & Werner Kessler (ed.).

{"id": "Schnellbomber", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnellbomber", "title": "Schnellbomber", "text": "A Schnellbomber (German; literally \"fast bomber\") is a bomber that relies upon speed to avoid enemy fighters, rather than relying on defensive armament and armor.\n\nConcept\nThe concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance.\n\nAdolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the Schnellbomber and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the Schnellbomber, lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and its heavier twin-engine Bf 110 counterpart due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first aircraft adopted for the Schnellbomber role was the single-engine Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engine Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability.\n\nBomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the Schnellbomber, and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940.\n\nJapan's air war in China\nAs World War II broke out in Asia with the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Navy dispatched dozens of their unescorted Mitsubishi G3M bombers in the schnellbomber strategy of Giulio Douhet's total war concept of attacks against Chinese Air Force assets as well as civilian targets, however, the strategy backfired as the Japanese underestimated the effectiveness of the Chinese air raid early-warning net and the numbers of experienced Chinese pilots leading their squadrons of Curtiss Hawk III (max-speed marginally slower than G3M) and Boeing P-26 Model 281 (max-speed marginally faster than G3M) fighters in a bloody rout against the Japanese bombers. Nonetheless, the total war strategy with the schnellbomber wasn't lost to the Japanese, as the Chinese lost many of their top fighter pilots by Fall of Nanking at the end of 1937, and with ever-growing Japanese blockade of war materials and high-octane aviation fuel particularly following the capture of Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, the increasing obsolescence of Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel versus fast and high-flying massed bomber formations burning high-octane avgas continued to wreak havoc and devastation against Chinese cities for years to come, particularly in the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu beginning in May 1939; eventually however, the United States enacted an oil and steel embargo against Japan in July 1941.\n\nGermany's quest for \"fast bombers\"\nThe Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer Schnellbombers, as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as Schnellbombers by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 Blitz (dubbed \"the fastest bomber\" – \"Schnellstbomber\").\n\nSeveral other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 — meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start — as a new Zerstörer heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765 km/h (475 mph).  The Bomber B high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original Schnellbomber role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier Schnellbomber designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the Bomber B program.\n\nde Havilland Mosquito\nThe most successful Schnellbomber of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own Schnellbomber concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all-wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name Moskito.\n\nSee also\nBomber B - 1939 design competition, meant to replace all bombers in Luftwaffe service\nFighter-bomber\nLight bomber\n\nReferences\n\nBomber aircraft\nLuftwaffe", "machine_abstract": "The Schnellbomber (German pronunciation: [ˈʃnɛlbʊmɐ], English: \"fast bomber\"; also known as the Sturmbomber) was a German World War II aircraft designed to attack targets at high speed and low altitude using its heavy armament of bombs or torpedoes.

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store.\n\nInternational Museum of Contemporary Art\nIn the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art.  The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC).\n\nThe exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miró,  Antoni Tàpies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso.\n\nThe courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs.\nBeneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two  connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nArrecife\nMuseums in the Canary Islands\nModern art museums in Spain\nCastles in Canary Islands\nBien de Interés Cultural landmarks in the Province of Las Palmas\nBuildings and structures in Lanzarote\nTourist attractions in Lanzarote", "machine_abstract": "The Castillo de San José (English: Castle of Saint Joseph) is the oldest surviving building in Havana, Cuba and was built by order of King Charles III as part of his plans to fortify Havana against British attack during the Seven Years' War.

{"id": "Diogo Dalot", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo%20Dalot", "title": "Diogo Dalot", "text": "José Diogo Dalot Teixeira (; born 18 March 1999), known as Diogo Dalot, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a right-back for  club Manchester United and the Portugal national team.\n\nDalot is a product of the Porto youth system and made his professional debut for the club's  B team in January 2017. He made his first-team debut in a Taça de Portugal game in October 2017. After making eight appearances for Porto, he joined Manchester United in June 2018 for a reported fee of €22 million (£19 million). From October 2020 to June 2021, Dalot was loaned to Italian Serie A club Milan.\n\nDalot was a youth international and represented Portugal from under-15 to under-21 level. He was a member of the under-17 squad that won the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He made his senior international debut for Portugal at UEFA Euro 2020.\n\nClub career\n\nPorto\nBorn in Braga, Dalot joined Porto's youth system in 2008, aged nine. On 28 January 2017, he made his senior debut with the B team, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home loss against Leixões for the LigaPro championship.\n\nDalot first appeared with the first-team in a competitive game on 13 October 2017, starting in a 6–0 away win over Lusitano de Évora for the season's Taça de Portugal. He first played in the Primeira Liga on 18 February 2018, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute in a 5–0 home routing of Rio Ave.\n\nManchester United\nDalot signed for Premier League club Manchester United on 6 June 2018 on a five-year contract for a fee of £19 million. Upon his arrival in Manchester, coach José Mourinho said that, considering his young age, he was one of the best right-backs around. He made his debut on 19 September 2018 in an away UEFA Champions League group stage match against Swiss side Young Boys, but was unable to have continuity in the team due to an injury sustained in the previous season. His debut in the Premier League happened on December 1 against Southampton in a 2–2 draw On 26 January 2020. Despite Mourinho's sacking and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being appointed as the new manager, Dalot remained a valuable option: at the end of the season, he had had 23 appearances, 16 of which in the Premier League. During that season, he had a memorable match in Paris, in the Champions League quarter-finals 2 nd leg against PSG, where Manchester United completed a remarkable comeback thanks to a late penalty, won after a shot by Dalot. He scored the second goal in a 6–0 FA Cup win against Tranmere Rovers; it was his first goal for United.\n\nDuring his first seasons for the club, Dalot struggled with various injuries and following the arrival of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, his performances were severely limited under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nLoan to AC Milan\nFollowing sporadic use by Manchester United, Dalot was loaned to Italian Serie A side AC Milan for the 2020–21 season. He made his debut for Milan on 22 October, starting in a 3–1 win against Celtic in a UEFA Europa League group stage match. Seven days later, Dalot scored his first goal for Milan and provided an assist for compatriot Rafael Leão in a 3–0 home group stage victory in the UEFA Europa League against Sparta Prague. He made his Serie A debut on 1 November, replacing Davide Calabria in the 71st-minute of a 2–1 away win against Udinese. He made his first start in the league in a 2–2 away draw against Genoa. On 7 March 2021, Dalot score his first Serie A goa in a 2–0 away in at Hellas Verona. \n\nDuring the season, Dalot's versatility enabled him to play either as a right back and left back. This made him an integral part of Stefano Pioli's team, helping Milan secure second place in the 2020–21 Serie A and qualification for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League after an eight-year absence. During his spell as a Rossonero, he was able to play regularly, making 33 appearances, scoring two goals and provinding three assists. As often said by Dalot himself, in Italy he was able to improve defensively, without losing his ability to attack.\n\nReturn to Manchester United\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, Manchester United were interested in signing another right-back. Meanwhile, Milan, who were impressed with Dalot during his loan move with the club, began negotiations with Manchester United to sign him on permanent basis. After returning to Manchester United, he impressed coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with his performances during pre-season. Borussia Dortmund were also interested in signing him on a loan deal, but he decided to remain at United to compete with Aaron Wan-Bissaka for a starting position. On 22 September, Dalot was given his first start of the season, featuring in a 1–0 home loss to West Ham United in the third round of the EFL Cup. Since then, he has had limited opportunities with two starts and three substitute appearances. He played against Villarreal in a Champions League group stage match after Wan-Bissaka was suspended for two games. \n\nOn 2 December, Dalot was given his first start in the league under interim manager Michael Carrick, putting an impressive performance and creating the second goal in a 3–2 home win over United's rivals Arsenal at Old Trafford. Following the arrival of interim manager Ralf Rangnick, Dalot cemented his place as starter for the club, following his solid performances in the club's next two matches against Crystal Palace and Norwich City.\n\nInternational career\n\nYouth\nDalot helped Portugal win the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, scoring twice in five games in Azerbaijan including once in the final against Spain. The same year, he helped the under-19 team reach the quarter-finals of the same competition.\n\nWith the under-19s, Dalot participated in the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, helping finishing as runner-up, after losing in the final to England. For his performances throughout the competition, he was named in the \"Team of the Tournament\". Dalot played for Portugal at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup, starting in all the matches in an eventual quarter-final exit.\n\nOn 10 November 2017, he won his first cap for the Portugal under-21s, starting in a 1–1 away draw against Romania for the 2019 UEFA European Championship qualifiers. In March 2021, Dalot took part in the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Portugal finished as runners-up after losing in the final 1–0 to Germany.\n\nSenior\nOn 13 June 2021, Dalot was included in Portugal's squad for UEFA Euro 2020 as a replacement for João Cancelo, who withdrew after testing positive for COVID-19. He made his debut ten days later in the final group game – a 2–2 draw with France in Budapest – in which he replaced Nélson Semedo for the final 11 minutes. On  27 June, Dalot made his first start with the senior national team, in a 1–0 loss to Belgium in the round 16.\n\nIn October 2021, he was called up by Portugal and on October 9, he provided two assists, with the first being converted by Cristiano Ronaldo in a 3–0 home win against Qatar.\n\nStyle of play\nDalot is a physically strong defender known for his speed, technique and offensive capabilities. He can play as a full-back or winger on either flank, although he usually plays on the right. He is usually deployed as a wing-back on the right but in a more conventional full-back role on the left. As a left-back, he has been praised for his work ethic and defensive awareness. He has good dribbling skill and is noted for his involvement in counter-attacks by making crosses or long passes. His physique enables him to perform well in aerial duels.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\nPorto\nPrimeira Liga: 2017–18\n\nPortugal\nUEFA European Under-17 Championship: 2016\n\nIndividual\nUEFA European Under-17 Championship Team of the Tournament: 2016\nUEFA European Under-19 Championship Team of the Tournament: 2017\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPortuguese League profile \nNational team data \n\n1999 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Braga\nPortuguese footballers\nAssociation football defenders\nFC Porto B players\nFC Porto players\nManchester United F.C. players\nA.C.

{"id": "Riverside Polytechnic High School", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside%20Polytechnic%20High%20School", "title": "Riverside Polytechnic High School", "text": "Riverside Polytechnic High School is a four-year public high school in Riverside, California, United States, and part of the Riverside Unified School District.  The current facility, located on Victoria Avenue, was opened in September 1965; the traditions of the school go back to 1887, then known as the Riverside High School, making Riverside Polytechnic the oldest high school in the city.\n\nHistory \n\nRiverside Polytechnic High School traces its heritage from 1887,\nwhen the newly formed city of Riverside needed higher education for the community.  The first joint elementary and high school's first graduating class in 1890 comprised seven students—four girls and three boys. Eugenie Fuller was its principal. When classes grew too large in 1902, a new co-educational high school building was constructed on Ninth Street between Lemon and Lime Streets, and the original 14th Street building became the Grant School, serving grades 3–8.\n\nIn 1910, Riverside High School's enrollment was approximately 500 students, and new facilities were required. In 1911, the genders were separated, creating a Girls High School at the Ninth Street building, and the Polytechnic High School for boys at a newly constructed campus on Terracina Avenue. Fuller continued as principal of the Girls High School, and Mr. J.E. McKown was appointed principal of the Riverside Polytechnic High School.\n\nIn 1916, the Polytechnic High School began offering postgraduate classes. The Riverside Junior College District was formed in 1920, and the Riverside Junior College moved out of the high school to an adjacent property.\n\nWorld War I brought changes to both high school campuses. The earlier enrollment explosion waned as young men joined the armed forces. In 1924, the school board created a junior high school level and consolidated the senior high schools into one co-educational school. A new Applied Arts Building provided Home Economics and \"other facilities for the girls.\" The old Girls High School now served as a Girls Junior High School, while the Boys Junior High School was located at the old Grant School. 1924–25 saw the Junior College and the Senior High School with growing enrollments, and so provided separate administrations for each. There were 202 seniors in 1924.\n\nDuring World War II, many Poly girls worked with a federal government–sponsored group called the High School Victory Corps.\nThe girls helped make bandages and other needed items, or worked in essential industries after school. All who took part in these activities were volunteers. In 1944, the Victory Corps was discontinued at Poly.\n\nIn the 1940s, there was a tradition that each incoming class at the school would be given an unflattering nickname that would remain with the class until their graduation.  For example, the class of 1951 was dubbed the \"Geeks\" and the class of 1953 was the \"Orts\".\n\nIn 1956, double sessions at Poly were needed until a second high school, Ramona High, could be built. As high school enrollment continued to grow, it was evident that a third high school would be needed in Riverside. In 1960, a new high school, Rubidoux, shared the Poly campus until its campus could be completed in 1961.  In 1965, Poly separated from the junior college campus and a site on the corner of Central and Victoria Avenues was built, along with a high school on Third Street and Chicago Avenue, named North High. Both high schools opened their doors in September 1965, with the Victoria site keeping the traditional name of Riverside Polytechnic High School. Since that time, Poly High School classes have taken place on the present site.\n\nRiverside Polytechnic High School is home to one of the original, still active Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) units, established in 1917 and was originally called the Poly High Cadet Corps. It is the oldest JROTC program west of the Mississippi River, and second oldest in the United States. In 1970 it was among the first JROTC units to offer a girls program \n\nThere were 51 young men making up the Class of 1916, known as the \"Stags of 1916\". There were 18 faculty members. This class was the first to complete the four-year course offered in the new building.\n\nNotable alumni\n\nNotable instructors\n Edmund Jaeger – noted naturalist, his first zoology class in 1921 had 3 students\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official School website\n \n\nPolytechnic\nPublic high schools in California\nEducational institutions established in 1887\n1887 establishments in California", "machine_abstract": "Riverside Poly is the only public high school in Riverside, California and serves grades 9 through 12.

During World War II, Brooke, a navy nursing sister, was decorated for her actions during the sinking of the passenger ferry . The vessel's keel was laid down on 29 May 2017 and the vessel was launched on 10 November 2019. The ship was scheduled to begin contractor sea trials in May 2021. The vessel was delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy for post-acceptance sea trials on 15 July 2021.\n\nReferences\n\nHarry DeWolf-class offshore patrol vessels\n2019 ships\nShips built in Nova Scotia", "machine_abstract": "The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) is the oldest surviving regiment of Foot Guards in continuous existence, dating back to 1660 when King Charles II formed it as his personal bodyguard from volunteers recruited throughout England and Scotland.\nIn 1778 HMS Margaret Brooke was commissioned by Captain James Cook on behalf of the British East India Company; she served under him during three voyages between 1768-1779.

{"id": "Kaira (spider)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaira%20%28spider%29", "title": "Kaira (spider)", "text": "Kaira, sometimes called frilled orbweavers, is a mostly neotropical genus of orb-weaver spiders first described by O. Pickard-Cambridge in 1889. It includes sixteen described species that occur from South America up to the southern and eastern USA. It is presumably related to Aculepeira, Amazonepeira and Metepeira.\n\nThey spin small webs from which they hang upside down and attract male moths that fly into a basket formed by their legs. They use a moth pheromone for this, which resembles the one used by the bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora. Though they belong to the same family, the two genera are not closely related, so this is likely an example of convergent evolution.\n\nAll species are pale yellow-white with scattered, small, white, brown and black random spots, or in some species transverse bands. Females have a body length of about . Males are less than half the size of females and less pigmented.\n\nKaira specimens are uncommon in arachnologist collections, and the females of different species are difficult to separate. Females and immatures can be confused with species of the not closely related genus Pozonia.\n\nBehavior\nWhen a fly was put into a jar containing a K. alba, the female dropped from the underside of the lid on what seemed a single thread about  long and hung there until the fly blundered into her. Then she clamped her legs around it and killed it. Instead of constructing orb webs, they construct a small trapezoidal web, containing two triangular zigzags of threads, which is remade every twenty minutes. The spider then hangs upside-down by the fourth leg on the lower and shorter parallel edge of the trapezoid, which is spread by the other legs. When a moth flies into the basket formed by the spider's legs, it is clasped and bitten, and later wrapped in araneid-like fashion. The moth is then hung from a trapeze line between the last legs of the spider, which resumes the hunting posture. As many as eight moths can be caught in this way before the spider starts feeding.\n\nSpecies\n it contains sixteen species:\nKaira alba (Hentz, 1850) – USA, Mexico\nKaira altiventer O.

She attended high school in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, and a boarding school in Queluz to the west of Lisbon. She began her career as a journalist and writer at the children's newspaper O Papagaio. In 1941, she started working at Rádio Renascença, a station owned by the Catholic Church. Beginning as a secretary she graduated to being an announcer. Later, she worked at the magazine Modas & Bordados, a supplement of the O Século newspaper. The magazine was edited by Maria Lamas, a leading feminist. In 1946, when Lamas was appointed president of the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (National Council of Portuguese Women - CNMP), Lopes de Almeida became editor of that magazine and also wrote short stories and reports for the magazine O Século Ilustrado. She also published several books of recipes, as well as children's books, and contributed to the radio station, Rádio Clube Português.\n\nOpposition to government\nIn 1944, Lopes de Almeida started working as an announcer for Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão. A year later she was one of the early supporters of the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), a quasi-legal organization set up after World War II in opposition to the Portuguese Estado Novo dictatorship. She became active with the CNMP until its closure by the Estado Novo in 1947. In 1962, she was dismissed from Modas & Bordados for political reasons, having signed a petition against the colonial war in Africa. Because of the danger of arrest for publishing articles hostile to the government, she began to write using pseudonyms. In 1968 she went to Paris, sending back reports to O Século about Portuguese emigrants in the city who were opponents of the regime. In 1969 she was a candidate for the Comissão Eleitoral de Unidade Democrática (Electoral Commission for Democratic Unity - CEUD) for the national assembly, although with no hope of success as the elections were controlled by the Estado Novo.\n\nMember of parliament\nAfter the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, which overthrew the Estado Novo, Lopes de Almeida headed Radiodifusão Portuguesa Internacional, visiting several Portuguese communities abroad as part of her work. She represented the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS) in the Constituent Assembly of Portugal, which agreed a new Constitution for the country, and was a Deputy in the first Legislature of the Assembly of the Republic, from 1976 to 1978, representing the Évora constituency and in the second Legislature (1979–80), representing Lisbon.\n\nLater life\nIn later life she devoted herself to the problems of the elderly and was a founder of Fundação Sara Beirão / António Costa Carvalho in Tábua in Portugal'’s Coimbra district. In 1993, Lopes de Almeida chaired, in Strasbourg, a session of the European Parliament for the Elderly, during which the European Charter for the Elderly was approved. Etelvina Lopes de Almeida died on 30 April 2004 in Tábua, after a long illness.\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 1982, she was elected Woman of the Year by the National Council of Women in Brazil.\nIn 1995, she was made a Commander of the Portuguese Order of Merit.\n\nReferences\n\n1916 births\nPeople from Serpa\n2004 deaths\nSocialist Party (Portugal) politicians\nPortuguese socialists\nPortuguese feminists\nPortuguese journalists\nMembers of the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)\nPortuguese radio people", "machine_abstract": "Lopes, Etelvina; Almeida, Maria da Graça (2008).

Built at Brest on private plans by Pierre Ozanne, she was particularly fast. The French Navy adopted the design and copied the plans as late as 1848. Originally armed with 6-pounder guns, she was later rearmed with heavier carronades. She continued in service, off and on, until she was struck in 1854.\n\nService history\n\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\nDiligente took part in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 in Leissègues' squadron, culminating in the Battle of San Domingo.\n\nThe frigates , , and Diligente captured and burned the American vessel Lark, Moore, master, which was sailing from Philadelphia to Jamaica.\n\nIn August 1808 Diligente, captained by Commander Jean-François Lemaresquier, with the corvettes  and Espiègle, sailed from France with supplies for the island of Martinique. British ships chased the group through the Bay of Biscay and captured Sylphe and Espiègle. Diligente escaped, only to encounter the British sloop , under Commander (later to be Admiral) Charles Napier, off Antigua. During a hard-fought action lasting three hours, Recruits mainmast fell, putting her somewhat at Diligentes mercy. However, a lucky shot ignited Diligentes ammunition store, causing some damage.  Diligente withdrew and later Lemaresquier justified his action on the grounds that other British naval vessels were approaching, which they were not, and the weight of Recruits broadside, which was heavier.\n\nOn 3 October, Diligente sank the Mexican brig Juliana. Then on 12 November she returned to Lorient. Here she served from 1811 to 1812 as a school ship. On 12 March she was in the harbour at Brest. On 2 December 1812, she accidentally collided with  in the Roads of Toulon.\n\nShe may have cruised in the Channel as  reported that on 20 December 1813 she had retaken and sent in the brig Racehorse, from Newfoundland for Teignmouth, that the French corvette Diligente had captured. In 1814 Diligente was paid off.\n\nBourbon Restoration\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, Diligente underwent refitting at Brest between 22 August 1820 and 4 January 1821. She was recommissioned with 18-pounder carronades and was reclassified as a corvette aviso (sloop corvette). Then on 21 April she left Brest for the Antilles, Guiana and Newfoundland. By 30 August 1822 she was in the Antilles again.\n\nOn 2 November 1822 Diligente left Rochefort for Brazil, not returning to Brest until 27 December 1826. Around 1825 or so she was off the coast of Chile where she took a privateer that had fired a broadside at her.\n\nIn 1827 Diligente was again decommissioned for refitting. Then in 1828 she was in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nJuly Monarchy\nUnder Commandant Garibou Diligente took part in the expedition to the mouth of the Tagus River where a French squadron fought the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831. The French vessels fought their way past the Portuguese forts guarding the mouth of the river and sailed up to Lisbon. There they forced the Portuguese king Dom Miguel to accede to French demands, among them that he recognize the July Monarchy. The French also seized all the military and commercial vessels they could find as reparations.\n\nThen in 1835–36 Diligente was on the Livorno station. On 30 January 1836, she was driven ashore and severely damaged at Livorno. On 26 October 1840 she left Toulon for Alexandria, Egypt. She visited Smyrna in March 1841. Lastly, she was present at Athens during the 3 September 1843 Revolution.\n\nFate\nDiligente was struck off on 11 October 1854.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n \n \n  (1671-1870)\n \n \n\nAge of Sail corvettes of France\nShips built in France\nDiligente-class corvettes\n1801 ships\nMaritime incidents in January 1836", "machine_abstract": "The French corvette Diligent was built in 1801 at Rochefort, France and launched on 16 May 1802 under the command of Captain de la Motte-Picquet.

{"id": "Cartographic censorship", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic%20censorship", "title": "Cartographic censorship", "text": "Cartographic censorship is the  deliberate modification of publicly available maps in order to disguise, remove, or obfuscate potentially strategic locations or buildings, such as military bases, power plants or transmitters. Sensitive objects and places have been removed from maps since historic times, sometimes as a disinformation tactic in times of war, and also to serve competitive political and economic interests, such as during the Age of Discovery when strategic geographic information was highly sought after. In modern times requests for censorship are sent to Google Earth for certain sites that are deemed to pose security risks for national governments.\n\nHistory\nThe renowned map historian, J.B. Harley, wrote in 1989:\n\nThroughout the history of modern cartography in the West ... there have been numerous instances of where maps have been falsified, of where they have been censored or kept secret, or of where they have surreptitiously contradicted the rules of their proclaimed scientific status.\n\nThe early policy of secrecy proved difficult to enforce and soon maps became subject to censorship and falsification.  Cartographic disinformation has long been a weapon in political propaganda, military counter-intelligence and covert diplomacy.\n\nMaps are weapons of war and the falsification of maps is a legitimate ruse de guerre. However, such Machiavellian arts were not confined to wartime, particularly in an age when there was very little peacetime. Fake maps were a weapon for all seasons, to be used against all rivals, political and commercial.\n\nNorth America \n\nIn October 1941, before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that he had \"a secret map\" of South America titled 'Luftverkehrsnetz der Vereinigten Staaten Süd-Amerikas Hauptlinien'. He said the map had been \"made in Germany by Hitler's government\" and that it showed that the Nazis had designs against the United States. It was a fake map, probably created by British intelligence agents, but Roosevelt may have thought it was genuine.\n\nEurope\n\nIn the Age of Discovery there was a premium on geographic information: ports of call for wood and fresh water, deep natural harbours, shorter passages and straits.\n\nGermany \nCensorship of maps was also used in former East Germany, especially for the areas near the border to West Germany in order to make attempts of defection more difficult.\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, or VOC, had a mission to censor cartographic knowledge of newly explored regions. It complained when ships owned by its rival, the Australische Compagnie, entered the Pacific by a new passage round Cape Horn, named the Le Maire Strait. The VOC persuaded the Dutch government to prohibit the publication of this latest geographical information. However, the injunction was lifted after twelve months and Willem Blaeu and other cartographers were permitted to publish revised maps.\n\nPortugal\n\nThe German cartographer Henricus Martellus made his famous mappamundi (World Map), soon after the Portuguese navigator, Bartolomeu Dias, sailed round  the southern tip of Africa. The map is based on a Portuguese prototype (which has not survived), but the coast of southern Africa is greatly extended and dislocated. Some scholars have suggested that this distortion is a result of misinformation circulated by King John II. His purpose was to pretend that the new eastern sea route to Asia and was far longer than it actually is, in order to discourage foreign interlopers from profiting from Portuguese discoveries.\n\nChristopher Columbus may have consulted Martellus' map (or a copy) before leaving Spain in 1492 to find the western route to Asia.\n\nRussia\n\nIn 1765, the Swiss geographer Samuel Engel, accused the Russian government of deliberately falsifying maps by extending Siberia 30° eastward. Its purpose, according to Engel, was to exaggerate the length and difficulty of the Northeast Passage along the arctic coast, in the hope of discouraging rival European merchants from attempting this route to the Pacific and China.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFrancis Drake \n\nWhen Francis Drake sailed on his voyage round the world in 1577, he was given clear instructions that \"none shall make any charts or descriptions of the said voyage.\" Furthermore, all charts made or captured from foreigners had to be delivered to the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council. Two hundred years later, the Admiralty's instructions to Captain Cook were almost identical.\n\nCaptain Cook \n\nThe British Admiralty sent James Cook on his three Pacific voyages during the Second Hundred Years War when France and Britain were vying for commercial supremacy and control of shipping lanes around the world.\n\nCook has been accused of making \"major mistakes in his charting\", such as depicting \"Stewart Island as a peninsula, and the failure to determine the insular character of Tasmania\".\n\nHowever, Cook was the greatest navigator of his day and too experienced to make such errors. During his three Pacific voyages, Cook was on a mission to keep secret any strategic discoveries he made such as off-shore islands and deep, natural harbours. He would report such prizes to the Admiralty when he returned to London, but meanwhile he would omit them from his journal and charts. Cook's program of disinformation was first proposed in the book Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage (2018).\n\nIn 1770, Cook found Sydney Harbour by walking overland from Botany Bay, along an Aboriginal track connecting the two inlets. He also identified Bass Strait which separates Tasmania from mainland Australia. However, off-shore islands can provide a base from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power so he concealed Tasmania's insularity. Similarly, Cook depicted New Zealand's Stewart Island as a peninsula, concealing Foveaux Strait.\n\nCaptain Cook's fake maps were not fake enough for the Admiralty. It wanted even greater concealment of politically sensitive discoveries when it commissioned Dr. Hawkesworth to write the official account of Cook's voyages. Thus the Admiralty's engraver  deliberately altered and refined Cook's manuscript charts when preparing them for printing. Hawkesworth's \"Journals\" was a bestseller in Europe, and the Admiralty's fake maps misled Britain's rivals for decades.\n\nCold War \nIn the United Kingdom, during the Cold War period and shortly after, a number of military installations (including 'prohibited places') did not appear on commercially issued Ordnance Survey mapping. This practice was effectively curtailed with the mass availability of satellite imagery. Another aspect of map censorship in the UK is that the internal layout of HM Prison facilities were not shown on public OS mapping.\n\nFalse altitudes\nA variant of censorship of maps is putting in false altitudes. This can be important for predicting flooding. In World War I many German soldiers were killed in Belgium after their camps were flooded, even though the maps used by German military indicated the camp sites were not prone to flooding.\n\nModern use \nCensorship of maps is today still often applied, although it is less effective in the age of satellite picture services. A \"dead map\" is a term often applied to sensitive government maps that show the location of top secret facilities and other highly sensitive installations within a country. Russia, the United States and Great Britain all have such maps.\n\nGoogle Earth censors places that may be of special security concern. The following is a selection of such concerns:\n Former Indian president Abdul Kalam had expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in India.\n Indian Space Research Organization says that Google Earth poses a security threat to India and seeks dialogue with Google officials.\n The South Korean government has expressed concern that the software offers images of the presidential palace and various military installations that could possibly be used by North Korea.\n Operators of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney, Australia asked Google to censor high resolution pictures of the facility. However, they later withdrew the request.\n The government of Israel also expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in its territory, and applied pressure to have Israeli territory (and the Occupied Territories held by Israeli forces) appear in less clear detail.\n The Vice President of the United States' residence (Naval Observatory) in Washington, DC has been pixelated, as has the Federal Gold Depository at Fort Knox.\n From June 2007 until January 2009, downtown Washington, DC was shown using USGS aerial photography from the spring 2002, while the rest of the District of Columbia was shown using imagery from 2005.\n\nCensorship of maps is also applied by Google Maps, where certain areas are greyed out or areas are purposely left outdated with old imagery.\n\nIn Lebanon, all maps concerning the country are property of the Lebanese Army and are issued by the Directory of Geographic affairs of the Lebanese military. It is considered a felony to reproduce whole or portions of maps without the permission of the military, although maps can be issued to certain universities and urban design schools for use by students and can be issued to civilian upon presenting certain documents. A notice is written on the maps prohibiting reproduction, copying or sale of the map and that it should be returned to the Ministry of National Defense upon request. This policy is meant to prohibit terrorists, outlaws, and entities that are at war with Lebanon from obtaining those maps.\n\nSimilar cases \nLists of air traffic obstacles may not be published by many countries as many of them are strategically important (chimneys of power stations, radio masts, etc.)\n\nExample \n Hiding a VLF-transmitter of Russian Navy on a map.

{"id": "Sobibór Museum", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobib%C3%B3r%20Museum", "title": "Sobibór Museum", "text": "The Sobibór Museum, or the Museum of the Former Sobibór Nazi Death Camp (), is a Polish state-owned museum devoted to memorializing the victims and atrocities committed at the former Sobibor extermination camp, located on the outskirts of Sobibór near Lublin. The Nazi German death camp was set up in occupied Poland during World War II, as part of the Jewish extermination program known as the Operation Reinhard, which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland. The camp was run by the SS Sonderkommando Sobibor, initially commanded by Franz Stangl. The number of Jews from Poland and elsewhere who were gassed and cremated there between April 1942 and October 14, 1943, is estimated at 250,000; possibly more, including those who were transported from other Reich-occupied countries.\n\nSince May 1, 2012, the Sobibór Museum has been managed as a branch of the Majdanek State Museum, dedicated to the history and commemoration of the Holocaust camps and subcamps of KL Lublin. Originally, the museum served as a branch of the district museum in nearby Włodawa, founded in 1981. The museum was temporarily closed to the public from April 2011 to May 2013 due to lack of funds. The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage reopened the Museum with additional funding after its administrative reorganisation.\n\nArchaeological and conservation work was conducted at the site between 2007 and 2017, revealing formerly buried features of the camp and thousands of items belonging to the victims. The mass grave site was covered with geotextile and crushed marble in 2017. In 2020, a new Museum and Memorial in Sobibór was inaugurated, with 323-square meters of exhibition space, displaying a permanent exhibition artifacts, photographs and documents.\n\nMuseum history\n\nBecause the Nazis had closed and destroyed the camp in late 1943, replanting the site to hide the evidence of what had taken place, little was known about the camp for years. The Sobibor trial in Hagen, Germany, and the parallel Hiwi, or Trawniki trials in Krasnodar in the former USSR brought publicity to the Nazi-directed activities at this death camp. These trials were inspired by the investigative work of Simon Wiesenthal, and the highly publicized capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 from Argentina by the Israeli Mossad, to stand trial in Jerusalem.\n\nMost Holocaust survivors had left Poland long before these events, and few from the camp are known to have survived the war. The camp was largely forgotten.\n\nThe first monument to Sobibór victims was erected in 1965 on the historic site. The Włodawa Museum, which commissioned the monument, established a separate Sobibór branch on October 14, 1993, on the 50th anniversary of the armed uprising of Jewish prisoners there. After some 300 prisoners escaped in 1943, the Nazis closed and destroyed the camp to try to hide the evidence of the mass killings. Only 58 of those former prisoners are known to have survived the war.\n\nThe small museum was scheduled to be replaced with a modern visitor centre, with a design chosen from an international design competition in 2013, sponsored by the Polish-German Foundation Pojednanie. On June 24, 2014, the State Secretary from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage presented the winning design at a ceremony in Warsaw. Attending were the King of the Netherlands Willem Alexander and his wife Queen Máxima, partners in the project along with Israel, Poland, and Slovakia. After parts of the former camp grounds were excavated by archeologists and the field of mass graves covered with geotextile and crushed marble, construction work on the new museum complex began in 2017.\n\nThe permanent exhibition of the new Museum and Memorial in Sobibór was inaugurated on October 29, 2020, with 323 square meters of exhibition space. Over 700 personal items belonging to the victims of the camp, from among 11,000 artifacts held by the museum, as well as documents and photographs, form the centerpiece of the exhibition. Sixteen thematic areas explain the history of the extermination camp and the Holocaust in occupied Poland.\n\nResearch and conservation programs\n\nThe Museum complex comprises a building, archives, and monuments. The museum building is located near the former railway station; these are connected by a paved Trail of Memory. Memorial monuments include a cast-iron statue of a woman with child, sculpted by Mieczysław Welter. It is installed on the former \"Road to Heaven\" (Himmelfahrtstrasse). In addition, a large circular enclosure has a mound of ashes and crushed bones of the victims, collected at the site and formed into a broad pyramid next to the original open-air cremation pits. A local archive of the facsimiles of testimonies and pertinent documents is available at the museum.\n\nThe camp is scheduled to undergo more advanced geophysical studies and further archaeological excavations to explore the site. Practically no fixed objects of any kind are found within the site, since the SS meticulously removed as much evidence as possible. Any research work around and near the graves is conducted under the strict supervision of the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich.\n\nThe first excavation project was completed in October 2007. More than one thousand items belonging to the victims were unearthed. In October 2009, the second excavation phase was conducted, which determined the exact placement of double-row barbed-wire fencing posts around the camp. The work revealed numerous new artifacts as well, including false teeth, keepsakes from Marienbad, and many suitcase keys.  In the autumn of 2012, the north-western section around mass graves 1 and 2 was analyzed. Geophysical  evidence was found of the barbed-wire enclosure that separated mass graves and cremation pits from the living area of Camp III, and that marked the perimeter of the killing zone.\n\nIn May 2013 the Israeli and Polish archaeologists conducting excavations near Camp III, unearthed an escape tunnel  long and 1.6–2 m deep in some places, beginning under the barracks of the Jewish Sonderkommando and leading toward a double-row, barbed-wire fence. The tunnel may have collapsed with people inside; the camp perimeter is known to have been mined. Notably, the camp records do not mention any incident related to a tunnel escape.\n\nOther new findings included children's identification tags from the Netherlands, and seven human skeletal remains. These may be remains of the Jewish work-detail who were shot after completing removal of the genocide evidence.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Museum and Memorial in Sobibór – Official site (English)\n \"Sobibor.

{"id": "Oklahoma State Highway 71", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%20State%20Highway%2071", "title": "Oklahoma State Highway 71", "text": "State Highway 71 (abbreviated as SH-71 or OK-71) is a state highway in eastern Oklahoma. It runs from State Highway 31 in Quinton north to intersect State Highway 9 near Enterprise. It then continues north to Lake Eufaula Dam, and then turns east to end at State Highway 2. It has no lettered spur routes.\n\nRoute description\n\nState Highway 71 begins at SH-31 on the west side of Quinton in northeast Pittsburg County. The highway initially follows the Quinton street grid, which takes it in a north-northwest direction. As the grid peters out on the outskirts of town, SH-71 breaks away to the west and then to the northwest to avoid Beaver Mountain, gradually curving around to a northerly heading as it approaches the county line. The route crosses into Haskell County about three miles north of Quinton.\n\nThe road continues north in Haskell County until it veers northeast and crosses Longtown Creek. The road then turns back north, passing through rural parts of the county. SH-71 intersects SH-9 in the unincorporated community of Enterprise, just over five miles (8 km) north of the Pittsburg–Haskell county line.  North of Enterprise, SH-71 parallels Brooken Creek until it drains into Lake Eufaula. The highway serves the boat docks and campgrounds on the east side of the lake, which is the largest entirely within Oklahoma. SH-71 then runs across the dam impounding the lake, bringing it into McIntosh County.\n\nSH-71 merely cuts across the southeast corner of McIntosh County; the highway spends only  within its boundaries. It soon enters Muskogee County, now on an eastbound trajectory. The road runs through the Canadian River valley, staying between the river and Hi Early Mountain. The route next turns northeast, away from the river but still skirting the mountain's base. It finally comes to an end at SH-2 about  south of Porum.\n\nHistory\n\nJunction list\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSH-71 at OKHighways\nSH-71 at Roadklahoma\n\n071\nTransportation in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Haskell County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in McIntosh County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Muskogee County, Oklahoma", "machine_abstract": "Highway 71 is the longest state highway in Oklahoma, running from north to south across most of the state's eastern half and through its largest city (and capital), Tulsa.\nHistory\n\nThe route was established as part of Route 66 on November 11, 1937.

It is the second-most heavily populated district on the island and is located on its northwestern coast.\n\nDescription\nTerrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. It is mainly rural and lacks any main settlement as there are many small villages dispersed throughout. Its population has fluctuated from 795 in 1998 to 908 in 2008 and 843 in 2016. It trails only Half Tree Hollow District in size.\n\nThe district is named after the Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, which is located there, and also within the district is Plantation House, the Governor's official residence. The island's only secondary school is situated in St Paul's — the Prince Andrew School.\n\nHistory\nWhen the Dutch East India Company occupied St Helena in December 1672, they made their first landing attempt at Lemon Valley Bay, but were beaten off with boulders and rocks thrown by the defenders from the heights on the sides of the valley. After the English recaptured it in May 1673, the mouth of the Lemon Valley was quickly fortified to better deter any future attempts. By 1717 the fort there was ruinous and a quarantine station was built further up the valley to house the slaves recently received from Madagascar that had smallpox. The fortification in Lemon Valley were allowed to continue to deteriorate until they were replaced by entirely new buildings 50-odd years later.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nDistricts of Saint Helena\nPopulated places in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha", "machine_abstract": "Saint Helena Government website - The island is served by the capital city of Jamestown and its airport at Saint Helena Airport (SHE/STH).

The Shire covered an area of , and its seat of government was the outer Geraldton suburb of Utakarra.\n\nHistorically a rural area, with the growth of Geraldton in recent years as a port and city, the areas of the Shire closest to Geraldton became increasingly urbanised. The council amalgamated with the City of Geraldton in 2007 to form the City of Geraldton-Greenough. On 1 July 2011 it became part of the City of Greater Geraldton.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Shire of Greenough originated as the Geraldton-Greenough Road District, which was established on 21 December 1951 with the amalgamation of the Geraldton Road District and the Greenough Road District. It was declared a shire as the Shire of Geraldton-Greenough with effect from 1 July 1961 following the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. It was renamed the Shire of Greenough on 19 March 1965.\n\nIt ceased to exist in 2007 when it merged with the City of Geraldton to form the City of Geraldton-Greenough.\n\nAmalgamation\nA recommendation was made to the Minister for Local Government by the Local Government Advisory Board in August 2006 to amalgamate the Shire of Greenough with the City of Geraldton.\n\nThe Greenough electors successfully petitioned for a referendum to determine whether amalgamation should proceed. This was held on 2 December 2006, and with a participation rate of 28.74%, a majority of 80% voted against the proposal. However, under the Local Government Act 1995 (clause 10 of Schedule 2.1) as the vote did not attract 50% of registered voters, it did not meet the requirements for a valid poll.\n\nThe councillors of both local government authorities resigned at the end of April 2007, and the first elections for new councillors took place in October 2007.\n\nWards\nThe Shire was divided into four wards until 2005 – West and Tarcoola Wards, each with four councillors, and North and South wards, each with two councillors.

{"id": "USS Tinsman (DE-589)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%20Tinsman%20%28DE-589%29", "title": "USS Tinsman (DE-589)", "text": "USS Tinsman (DE-589) was a Rudderow-class destroyer escort in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was sold for scrapping in 1973.\n\nNamesake\nCarl Welby Tinsman was born on 29 March 1924 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 19 August 1942 and served on the destroyer  as a seaman second class. While patrolling some  off the coast of Brazil on 10 March 1943, Eberle, ,  and  intercepted the German blockade runner Karin, flying a Dutch flag. Eberle and Savannah closed on the ship at flank speed and fired warning shots across her bow. Karins crew promptly set her afire and began to abandon ship. Tinsman was a member of the 14-man party from Eberle which boarded the blazing ship and attempted to save the ship. He continued his efforts to put out the fire until a sudden explosion of a demolition charge killed him. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHistory\nTinsman was laid down by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1943; launched on 26 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James Corley, sister of Seaman Tinsman; and commissioned on 26 June 1944.\n\nFollowing fitting out and trials, the destroyer got underway on 21 July 1944, proceeded to Bermuda on shakedown, and returned to Boston on 19 August. On 11 October, she departed Boston harbor and, the next day, joined a convoy bound, via the Panama Canal, for the South Pacific. She arrived at Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands late in November and, after training exercises, headed for New Guinea. On 2 December, she reached Hollandia, and was soon at sea again escorting a convoy to Leyte.\n\nOn 14 December, while Tinsman was in San Pedro Bay, a kamikaze plane grazed the bridge of a nearby tanker. A week later, the destroyer escort was back in New Guinea waters, anchoring in Humboldt Bay. The day after Christmas, she was on the move again, this time for waters off the Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea for antisubmarine patrol.\n\nIn the first days of the new year, she escorted a convoy to San Pedro Bay; then, on 6 January 1945, she departed Leyte to screen a convoy bound for Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. On 12 January—as Tinsman escorted a slow-moving group consisting of an oiler, tugs, and tows—kamikaze planes attacked her convoy. During the day, the American ships fought off four Japanese attackers, downing two of the planes. On the 13th, Tinsman's guns downed another Japanese aircraft. On the 14th, Tinsman anchored in Lingayen Gulf and retired the next day toward Leyte, arr:ving in San Pedro Bay on the 18th to prepare for the Bandings at Nasugbu, Luzon.\n\nTinsman departed Leyte Gulf on 27 January 1945 with Amphibious Group 8 and, on the 31st, arrived at Nasugbu Bay where troops of the 11th Airborne Division landed without serious opposition. That night a large number of Japanese Shinyo boats attacked the American ships. Armed with impact bombs, these small craft swarmed out of the darkness and attacked  as she patrolled not far from Tinsman. Tinsman provided illumination to assist Lough in defending herself, sinking at least six of the vessels. Tinsman departed Luzon on 2 February in a convoy bound for Mindoro. Throughout February, she shuttled between Mangarin Bay and Nasugbu Bay on escort duty.\n\nEarly in March, she left Leyte Gulf, bound for New Guinea. After taking on stores at Hollandia, Tinsman returned to the Philippines and resumed escort duty. In mid-April, she made a voyage to Palau; and, in July, she varied her routine of convoy duty with visits to Ulithi and Hollandia before returning to the Philippines.\n\nAlthough the war ended in August, Tinsman remained in the Far East, operating mainly in the Philippines. She also made voyages to Hollandia and Tientsin before setting course for home on 29 November. Steaming via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 18 December 1945.\n\nShe was later berthed at San Diego, where she was placed out of commission on 11 May 1946. On 15 May 1972, her name was struck from the Navy List; and, on 14 September 1973, her hulk was sold to Levin Metals Corporation, San Jose, California, for scrapping.\n\nTinsman received two battle stars for World War II service.\n\nSee also\n\nList of destroyer escorts of the United States Navy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Photo gallery at navsource.org\n\nRudderow-class destroyer escorts\n1944 ships", "machine_abstract": "USS Tinsman was the first ship of her class, and served in World War II as part of Destroyer Force 1 based at Pearl Harbor.\nThe destroyers were designed to be fast attack craft that could operate independently or alongside larger ships such as battleships.

{"id": "Nivatakavacha", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivatakavacha", "title": "Nivatakavacha", "text": "The Nivātakavacas () are a race of Asura demons in Hindu mythology. Their name is Sanskrit for \"of practical application; layer; garment\" and the like.\n\nForty million Nivātakavacas were born in the family of Prahlāda (though not supported by him). The army of the Asuras, the enemies of the Devas, was formed by the Nivātakavacas and Kālakeyas. They are incredibly strong and skilled in magic, mysticism and warfare, wielding powerful weapons. The Devas under Indra couldn't overcome them despite their many battles.\n\nThe Nivātakavacas are said to have terrorized the world, living deep beneath the ocean and residing in the city of Maṇimatī after securing boons from Brahmā. Despite their evil ways, they are also glorious and legendary beings. As told in the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāvaṇa with his sons Meghanada, Atikaya and with his army attacked them; but found himself unable to defeat them after hundred of years of battle. The two sides finally stroke an alliance after Brahmā intervened.\n\nMahābhārata account\nIn the Mahābhārata, their number is said to be about thirty million.\n\nThey are finally vanquished and destroyed entirely by Arjuna, who is asked to do so by his father  spiritual Indra as a preceptor's fee. Indra provides him a celestial chariot, with his driver and armor for battle.\n\nHe beheld the wonderful city of the Dānavas near the sea and entered beneath the earth. There ensued a dreadful conflict between Arjuna and the demons. Arjuna began to slay them by the thousands from his aerial chariot using celestial weapons. He slayed all the visible Dānavas opposing him. Meanwhile, the invisible Dānavas attempted to concoct magical illusions, causing Arjuna's charioteer Mātali to fall off.\n\nArjuna recovered him and dispelled the illusions via arms. The fierce elites of the Nivātakavacas assailed Arjuna with crags, distressing the warrior. Inspired by his driver's words, Arjuna discharged the favourite weapon of the king of the celestials, the dreadful thunder-bolt-(Vajra), with which he vanquished the remaining Dānavas.\n\nOn returning from battle, Arjuna described the mighty unearthly aerial city of Hiraṇyapura in the air. He claimed that this city was superior to that of the gods he beheld earlier. On learning that it was inhabited by several more Asuras, Arjuna took siege of it. He managed to destroy the city, with the help of Rudra's weapon, defeating the remaining Dānavas by throwing them from the sky and crushing the city.\n\nArjunawiwaha\nThe Javanese kakawin, Arjunawiwaha (the marriage of Arjuna) is set up on the incidents that take place surrounding Arjuna's exploits of the Nivatakavachas. The city of the demons is known as Manimantaka. Apart from the protagonist Arjuna, other main characters of the kakawin include Sakra, the king of gods and Suprabha, a celestial nymph who helps Arjuna on his mission.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Nivatakavacha have attracted the attention of  ancient astronaut theorists, who interpreted the Sanskrit word Nivatakavacha as \"ni-vata-kavacha\" = 'no-air-garment', that is, a spacesuit, or an  alien wearing a spacesuit. However, that analysis is in error, because, due to Sanskrit sandhi,  \"ni\" in the sense of  'no' or 'not' changes to \"nir\" if followed immediately by a \"v\", making a form which is not found,*\"Nirvatakavacha\".\n\nSee also\n Asuras\n Daityas\n Danavas\n Kalakeyas\n List of Asuras\n\nReferences\n\n The Ramayana\n The Mahabharata, translated by Kamala Subramaniam, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Press, 1977.\n\nAsura", "machine_abstract": "Nivatakavacha is the daughter of King Janaka and Queen Subhadrangi, sister to Prince Rama (the hero in The Ramayana) who was married off by her father as part of his political alliance against Ravana's kingdom.\nShe appears briefly at the end of the first chapter of the epic poem, where she gives birth to twins named Lava & Kusha after being impregnated by Hanuman while fleeing from Lanka during Sita's abduction.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Nivatakavacha\".

{"id": "Machrihanish", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machrihanish", "title": "Machrihanish", "text": "Machrihanish (, ) is a village in Argyll, on the west coast of Scotland. It is a short distance north of the tip of the Mull of Kintyre, which faces out towards Northern Ireland and the Atlantic.\n\nMachrihanish bay\nThe main sandy beach of Machrihanish Bay runs  north to Westport, providing opportunities for surfing. Basic accommodation is available for surfing groups in the Machrihanish village hall. There are static caravans, wooden wigwams and camping spaces at the Machrihanish Holiday Park. The village is one of the start/finish points of the Kintyre Way, one of Scotland's Great Trails. The Scottish Wildlife Trust's Largiebaan nature reserve lies to the south, about  along the Kintyre Way.\n\nFeatures\nCampbeltown Airport, formerly RAF Machrihanish, is located near the village. Although still available to the Royal Air Force, the former airfield has been taken over by the specially-formed Machrihanish Airbase Community Company.\n\nCoal was mined near the village; the Machrihanish Coalfield was one of Britain's smallest coalfields. A canal to Campbeltown was constructed between 1773 and 1794, later replaced by the narrow-gauge Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway. Machrihanish railway station opened in 1906 and finally closed in 1932.\n\nMachrihanish has a classic links golf course designed by Old Tom Morris, with views towards the islands of Gigha, Islay and Jura. A second, newer course has been built nearby called Machrihanish Dunes. This course is part of a multimillion-pound development by an American company, which has renovated the previously-dilapidated Ugadale Hotel in the village and owns the Royal Hotel on the sea front in nearby Campbeltown.\n\nWeather data is collected from Machrihanish and broadcast in the Shipping Forecast.\n\nNotable people\nReginald Aubrey Fessenden built a radio transmitting station with a  high mast there in 1905 to transmit Wireless Telegraphy to a similar station at Brant Rock in Massachusetts, United States. An exchange of messages took place on 1 January 1906 but the mast blew down in a gale on 5 December 1906 and was never rebuilt.\n\nCadets from the Air Training Corps recreated this historic trans-atlantic transmission in Easter of 2006.

Christie (born 1964) is a Professor of Medicine and Neuroscience at The University of Victoria. He helped found the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Victoria and served as its director from 2010–2017. He is a Michael Smith Senior Scholar Award winner. Christie received his PhD in 1992 from the University of Otago before doing postdoctoral work with Daniel Johnston at Baylor College of Medicine and Terrence Sejnowski at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and then became   Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia. Promoted to Associate Professor in 2007. Full Professor in 2013.\n\nResearch\nChristie's early research focused on heterosynaptic plasticity in the hippocampal formation. During the course of this work, he discovered that prior synaptic activity could impact the capacity for synapses to subsequently show activity-dependent forms of plasticity, a phenomenon that he originally called \"priming\" but that has since been termed \"metaplasticity\". His Ph.D. work generated 9 publications on synaptic plasticity with Abraham. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he became interested in how calcium entered neurons, and began a post-doctoral fellowship with Dan Johnston. In this period he showed for the first time, using calcium imaging, that different types of voltage-gated calcium channels were not distributed homogeneously throughout neuron dendrites and somata. Moreover, he was able to show that certain types of voltage-gated channels played a preferential role in long-term forms of synaptic depression, or LTD. Despite lasting only 2.5 years, this post-doctoral fellowship generated 8 publications. In 1996, Christie turned down several job offers at Canadian institutions and moved to the Salk Institute to work with T. Sejnowski. While his aspirations for becoming more involved in the computational modeling the Sejnowski lab was known for were not realized, it was during this period that met Dr.'s Henriette van Praag and Fred \"Rusty\"Gage and became interested in neurogenesis. Together these individuals published four influential publications on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with Christie performing the majority of the electrophysiological recordings.\n\nChristie's research has shown that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.\n\nThis work has since progressed to show that exercise can have beneficial effects for the brains of animals that have been exposed to ethanol while in the womb, an animal model of fetal alcohol syndrome effects. His current work continues to examine how exercise can benefit the brain. He is part of the Island Medical Program and the Division of Medical Sciences, a joint venture of the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria to increase the number of medical doctors being trained in Canada, and teaches neuroanatomy and problem-based learning (PBL) in this program . His current research concentrates on how exercise generates new brain cells, enhances synaptic plasticity, and affects learning and memory processes in people with Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). particularly in the hippocampus. This work is funded by a variety of organizations including NSERC, FRAXA, Azrieli, and CIHR. Christie also has an extensive research program focused on mild traumatic brain injury at the University of Victoria. He is the director of the concussion laboratory at UVic, which focuses on clinical research, but has also initiated an extensive pre-clinical research program around repeated mild traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is funded by CIHR. He has recently expanded the focus of his prenatal exposure research to include both prenatal cannabis and prenatal ethanol exposure, and is funded by CIHR to determine how prenatal exposure to these substances impacts learning and memory processes in the developing brain.

Ferritin, a routine investigation for anemia, is an acute-phase reactant, and may be elevated in states of inflammation, thereby falsely indicating that iron stores are adequate. Because sTfR is insensitive to inflammation, it can detect anemia in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, and is particularly useful in distinguishing between the anemia of chronic disease and anemias caused by lack of iron intake.\n\nTo date, the conventionally identified soluble transferrin receptor has not been itself implicated in intracellular delivery of transferrin and associated iron stores.\n\nA soluble receptor for any ligand could also refer to a molecule present is solution (for example a secretory protein) which would bind with the target ligand and then  effect cellular delivery.

{"id": "Castleton-on-Hudson, New York", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleton-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York", "title": "Castleton-on-Hudson, New York", "text": "Castleton-on-Hudson is a village located in the southwestern part of the town of Schodack in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 1,473 at the 2010 census. The village is southeast of Albany.\n\nAs of 2019, Castleton-On-Hudson was recognized as a Tree City USA from the Arbor Day Foundation.\n\nHistory \nCastleton gets its name from the exploration of the North (Hudson) River by Henry Hudson. While traveling up the river, he came upon a Mahican Indian village noted for a large structure located on a rise above the river. This structure was a storehouse for foodstuffs, but was of such size that it was thought to be a \"castle\".  Another theory for the derivation of the name \"Castleton\" comes from Rutherford Hayner's Troy and Rensselaer County New York: A History (1925). Hayner states \"Although the exact location of this landing of Hudson's has been more or less conjectural, the weight of opinion places it at or near the present site of the village of Castleton, for on Castle Hill, back of the village, stood the dwelling of the chief of the Mohicans.\"\n\nThe area of Castleton was settled in 1792. When the small village was incorporated into Rensselaer County on 13 April 1827, there were about 100 people living in the area, mostly along the banks of the river. Between 1890 and 1920, the village had a booming economy, with small industry, a hotel, and a small port to gain access to river traffic. However, a large flood destroyed much of the business district in 1936, and the industry took the opportunity to relocate. These days the town is a very residential suburb, with some light agriculture.\n\nThe name of the village was changed from Castleton to Castleton-on-Hudson in 1927.\n\nThe Gazetteer of the State of New York of 1860 reports that Castleton was formerly known as Morriches Hastie. (JH French, 1860)\n\nThe District School No. 3 and Joachim Staats House and Gerrit Staats Ruin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all  land.\n\nThe village is on the east bank of the Hudson River.\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,619 people, 615 households, and 399 families residing in the village. The population density was 2,025.5 people per square mile (781.4/km2). There were 654 housing units at an average density of 818.2 per square mile (315.6/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 96.79% White, 1.36% African American, 0.25% Asian, 0.93% from other races, and 0.68% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.79% of the population.\n\nThere were 615 households, out of which 35.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.0% were married couples living together, 15.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.1% were non-families. 29.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.06.\n\nIn the village, the population was spread out, with 27.1% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 19.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 83.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 73.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the village was $44,141, and the median income for a family was $51,957. Males had a median income of $36,019 versus $26,976 for females. The per capita income for the village was $18,660. About 2.5% of families and 8.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.3% of those under age 18 and 10.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nNotable people\nJames L.

{"id": "Eucalyptus olsenii", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus%20olsenii", "title": "Eucalyptus olsenii", "text": "Eucalyptus olsenii, commonly known as the Woila gum, is a species of small tree that is endemic to a restricted area on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales. It has smooth bark with rough bark on the lower trunk, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped or urn-shaped fruit.\n\nDescription\nEucalyptus olsenii is a tree that typically grows to a height of  high and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (olsenii) honours Ian Sinclair Olsen, who recognised the species as distinct on a bushwalking expedition lead by Henry Fairlie-Cuninghame who collected the type material.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nWoila gum is restricted to mountains north east of Cooma and south of Braidwood, where it grows in woodland in poor soil on steep slopes. It also grows well as an ornamental tree.\n\nReferences\n\nolsenii\nMyrtales of Australia\nTrees of Australia\nFlora of New South Wales\nPlants described in 1980\nTaxa named by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson", "machine_abstract": "Etymology[edit]\n\nDescription[edit]\n\n\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\n\n\nDistribution[edit]\n\nEcological role[edit]\n\nCultivation and uses[edit]\n\n\n\nNotes", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Eucalyptus olsenii\".

The museum was established in 1846, by the Royal Society of Tasmania, the oldest Royal Society outside England. \nThe TMAG receives 400,000 visitors annually.\n\nHistory\nThe museum was officially created in 1848, though the collections it housed were much created earlier. It merged a number of disparate collections, including that of the Royal Society of Tasmania. The Mechanics' Institution of Hobart, Van Diemen's Land Agricultural Society and Van Diemen's Land Scientific Society had each attempted to found a museum earlier than this date, the most successful of these being the Mechanics' Institution, but little record remains of what happened to these efforts.\n\nSir John Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet, during his period was Lt. Governor of Tasmania, did much of the work that led to the modern museum. The museum was noted as first being an established institution in the 1848 minutes of the Royal Society of Tasmania, though Wilmot had done most of the work in 1843 and had attempted to set up a museum in the cottage of the Secretary of the Governor, in what is now the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. In 1838 the Mechanics' Institution received an agreement from the government for a room to be constructed in the Customs House for use as a museum. Customs House was later requisitioned by the Legislative Council of Tasmania and became Parliament House, Hobart. The Royal Society of Tasmania later founded TMAG in the sub-committee room of the Parliament, possibly the same room.\n \nThe museum moved to Harrington St in 1852, where it paid £60 a year in rent for a hall there. In 1853 the governor placed before the Legislative Council a debate on the state granting a plot of land for the building of a permanent museum building. In 1854 the museum attracted over 1000 visitors in a year for the first time. In 1855 the Lady Franklin Museum, founded in 1842 at Acanthe Park (now Lenah Valley), sold its fittings and collection to the Royal Society and these were added to the TMAG. The acquisition was driven by the donation of a large geology collection by Joseph Milligan.\n\nIn 1861 after a number of years, funding was acquired from the state government to construct a museum and the Royal Society hosted an architectural contest. Henry Hunter won and was awarded the contract to design a permanent building for the museum. Henry Young, Governor of Tasmania, laid the cornerstone in that year. The Museum was completed by 1862 and a celebratory art exhibition was hosted by Morton Allport, Henry Hunter and a Captain F. E. Chesney. The art exhibition's objective was to raise money for internal fittings of the building, as the money allocated by the state had only covered construction of the building. In 1884 Alexander Morton, previously Assistant Curator of the Australian Museum, was appointed curator.\n\nIn 1885 the museum was passed from the Royal Society of Tasmania to the a board of trustees under the state government, with a yearly endowment of £500. Until this point it was officially named The Royal Society's Museum. The Royal Society granted the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hobart to the state government at the same time, and they became known as the Tasmanian Museum and Botanical Gardens in that year. Adye Douglas, Premier of Tasmania, was elected Chair of the Board and Alexander Morton was reelected curator and secretary with an annual salary of £200.\n\nIn 1889 a new wing was opened by R Hamilton to extend the museum. In 1890 Betsey Island, then Franklin Island, was granted to the Trustees of the Museum.\n\nIn 1952 the boards of the Botanical Gardens and the Museum were split and the museum assumed its modern name. An act of Parliament was passed to make this so.\n\nGovernance\nIn 1885, TMAG became a Government authority under the control of a Board of Trustees that also controlled the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. By statute, it is now controlled by a Board of Trustees, and is currently part of the Department of State Growth.\n\nAssociated bodies\nTMAG has a number of associated bodies. The Foundation of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery serves as the primary fundraising body for the TMAG. The Friends of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery works to encourage community engagement with the museum, along with its youth-focused counterpart TMAGgots. The Royal Society of Tasmania founded the museum, donating much of its collection, and continues to loan a significant number of pieces.\n\nOther facilities\nIn addition to the main campus, TMAG includes three external sites: a herbarium, a storage and research facility, and the Moonah Workshop.\n\nState collection\nThe museum and art gallery reopened to the public on 15 March 2013, after a four-month closure for redevelopment works.\n\nSee also\n List of museums in Tasmania\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Twitter stream\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery YouTube channel\nFlora of Tasmania Online\nTMAGgots website\n\nLandmarks in Hobart\nMuseums in Hobart\n1843 establishments in Australia\nNatural history museums in Australia\nCulture in Hobart\nArt museums and galleries in Australia\nNumismatic museums in Australia\nGovernment agencies of Tasmania\nTasmanian Heritage Register", "machine_abstract": "The Tasmania Museum & Art Gallery (TMAG) is the state art museum of Tasmania, Australia.

{"id": "Cello Sonata (Strauss)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello%20Sonata%20%28Strauss%29", "title": "Cello Sonata (Strauss)", "text": "Richard Strauss composed his Cello Sonata in F major, Op. 6, TrV 115, in 1883 when he was 19 years old. It was dedicated to the Czech cellist Hanuš Wihan, who gave the premiere in 1883. It rapidly became a standard part of the cello repertoire.\n\nComposition history\n\nStrauss completed the first version of the Cello Sonata on 5 May 1881. His sister Johanna was a good friend of Dora Wihan, a talented pianist and wife of the cellist Hanuš Wihan (he was known by the first name Hans in Germany), who played in the Munich Court orchestra along with Richard's father Franz. \"Through these relationships, Strauss came to know Wihan and his instrument's idiomatic possibilities\". He composed and dedicated the sonata for \"his dear friend\" (Seinem lieben Freunde) Hans Wihan. On the first manuscript, he added a verse by Austrian poet Franz Grillparzer:\n\nIn March 1883 he revised the sonata into its current form, notably replacing the original finale with a completely new one. The sonata is in the traditional three movements:\n\n Allegro con brio\n Andante ma non troppo.\n Finale - Allegro vivo.\n\nNorman Del Mar wrote that \"...the influence of Mendelssohn is strongly marked. The opening of the sonata has a fine verve and Strauss wrote proudly home to his parents that the celebrated violinist Joseph Joachim had congratulated him\" Strauss had met Joachim at an evening concert on 16 January at Berlin where they shared the stage: Strauss had accompanied Robert Hausmann in the Cello Sonata, and Joachim continued with the Beethoven Romance in G and Bach's Chaconne from the D minor Partita.\n\nPerformances\n\nThe premiere was given on 6 December 1883 in Nuremberg, by Hans Wihan and pianist Hildergard von Koenigs.  On 19 December of the same year, while visiting Dresden, Strauss accompanied the principal cellist of the Dresden Court Orchestra, Ferdinand Böckmann. Oscar Franz, a horn player in the orchestra, reported to Franz Strauss: Your son's wonderful sonata had a magnificent reception and is indeed a splendid work, full of original feeling, and everything flows so wholesomely from it. I take the greatest pleasure in your son's success.\n\nWilli Schuh notes that \"Of all the works from this period of Strauss's creative life, the Cello Sonata is still the one that is heard most often\", and that \"This sonata quickly became one of Strauss's most frequently performed works\". Strauss himself accompanied the sonata on several occasions later in his life: including concerts at Leipzig on 31 March 1890 (Alvin Schröder on Cello)), New York on 18 March 1904 (Leo Schulz) and Manchester (UK) on 21 December 1904 (Carl Fuchs).\n\nRomanze for cello and orchestra \n\nAbout the same time as Strauss wrote the Sonata, he also wrote a single movement Romanze for cello and orchestra. Norman Del Mar wrote:  A further composition for the Cello, though this time with orchestral accompaniment, also belongs to this period, a most attractive Romanze which has unfortunately remained unpublished. It is a gentle 3/8 movement, similar in type to the slow movements of the violin and Horn concertos, both of which precede by date of composition.\n\nThe piece was completed on 17 June 1883, and was performed a few times by Hans Wihan, who premiered it on 15 February 1884 at Baden-Baden and went on to perform it in Aachen, Freiburg, and elsewhere It was dedicated to Anton Ritter von Knözinger. The piece somehow came to be forgotten, but was eventually published by Schott in 1987. It was first performed in modern times by cellist Jan Vogler, with the Orchestra of the Dresden Semperoper conducted by Günter Neuhold on 12 May 1986. The orchestra is double woodwind, two horns and strings. The piece takes about 10 minutes to perform.\n\nThere is also an abridged (shortened) version of the Romanze for Cello with piano accompaniment, which Strauss dedicated to Ferdinand Böckmann (principal cellist in the Dresden Court Orchestra).  This is about one third of the length \"and also shows numerous deviations from the original orchestral version\". Many copies of this version have survived, indicating its popularity at the time. Whether Wihan used a piano arrangement of the orchestral version or the abridged version \"it is no longer possible to say\". The abridged version was first performed in modern times by Peter Wöpke on cello accompanied by Wolfgang Sawallisch on 17 October 1985 in Munich.\n\nThe Dora Wihan-Weis affair\n\nRichard Strauss became close to Dora, who was four years older than him. Sister Johanna Strauss wrote of Dora, \"She was like one of the family. Herr Wihan was insanely jealous over this pretty and already rather coquettish wife. I often witnessed scenes. When Richard was with us, we used to make music. She was very musical and an excellent piano player\". The marriage ended in divorce after a few years. Hans left to become a Professor at the Prague Conservatory and going on to found the celebrated Bohemian Quartet and later worked with Antonín Dvořák on his Cello Concerto in B minor. Dora and Richard developed a deep understanding and whole-hearted liking, and \"there can be no doubt that they were in love for some years\". Dora kept a photograph of Richard (inscribed To his beloved and only one, R) on her piano until she died in 1938.  They wrote many letters to each other, which she ordered be destroyed on her death.  Strauss also destroyed her letters to him: possibly because of his jealous wife Pauline de Ahna whom he married in 1894. There was a lot of gossip in Munich, and when Richard moved to Meiningen his father warned him of the need to preserve a spotless reputation: \"Don't forget how people here talked about you and Dora W.\" There is one surviving letter from Richard to Dora, written in 1889: \"The fact is, that your letter, putting off the prospect of seeing you again for the foreseeable future, has upset and distressed me deeply. God, what wooden expressions those are for what I really feel...Strauss the artist is doing very well! But may no happiness be complete?!\"\n\nIn January 1911, they met again under difficult circumstances in Dresden. Dora was the co-repetiteur at the rehearsals for the premiere of Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss gave her a signed copy of the vocal score. Sister Johanna was delighted to meet her old friend, inviting her to dinner with the family. Wife \"Pauline was furious and treated Dora like a rival. Richard, as always, took his wife's part, and there was no further contact between them\". In his notebook, there is a cryptic entry on 9 March 1911 \"Letter to Hanna (his sister, Johanna) concerning D.Wihan\" (Brief an Hanna weg D.Wihan). On 31 January 1938 he made the entry \"Dora Wihan-Weis deceased\".\n\nRecordings \nThe first recording of the sonata was made by Raya Garbousova with pianist Erich Itor Kahn, issued as part of the Concert Hall Society Limited Edition Records in 1948-9 (reference C14, consisting of three 78rpm records), which is not at present available. There is a recording from December 1953 at the Beethoven-Saal, Hanover with Ludwig Hoelscher and pianist Hans Richter-Haaser. Another historic recording was made on 28 September 1966, with cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and Leonard Pennario, at the Webster Hall, New York issued on RCA Victor. There are many recordings currently available, which include:\n\nThe Romanze has been recorded many times with orchestra or piano since it was published in 1987/8, and is often released alongside the Cello sonata.

SportsCenter Asia covered mostly football, but it also showed highlights of the NBA, tennis, baseball, Formula One, and golf.\n\nSportsCenter Asia was officially launched on May 27, 2002, with Jason Dasey as its original anchor. It was recognised as the region's number one show of its kind by winning the 'Best Sports Program' category at the 2003 Asian Television Awards and received a commendation for 'Best News Program' at the 2005 Asian Television Awards. Other past anchors of the program include Uday Joshi, Bethan Evans, Cheryl Liew, David Basheer and Arnold Gay. Former CNBC Asia correspondent Colette Wong became a co-anchor in March 2004 with Steve Dawson joining in late 2004, employed initially as an assistant producer. Dez Corkhill was the original executive producer and sometimes appeared on the show as a football pundit. ESPN International football commentator Dave Roberts returned to Singapore in late 2011 to take over as Senior Executive Producer for SportsCenter and other news and production programs before leaving in early 2015.\n\nFollowing News Corporation's take over of ESPN Star Sports (which jointly operated ESPN and Star Sports in the region) in 2012, ESPN aired the last edition of first incarnation of SportsCenter Asia on 25 January 2013, and returned with the first edition as Fox Sports Central on 28 January, the day ESPN was relaunched as Fox Sports. Fox Sports in Taiwan used to produce a local edition in Mandarin Chinese from the studios in Taipei.\n\nOn September 18, 2020, it was reported that programme would end after Disney announced that it would shut down Fox Sports operations in Taiwan at end of 2020. It was later revealed that operations in Taiwan would end on January 1, 2021 following years on losing money in the region.\n\nThe revamped version and second incarnation of SportsCenter Asia, launched on 26 January, 2021, broadcasts every day on Disney's Fox Sports Asia networks.\n\nEditions\n\nTaiwan \nThe Taiwanese edition of Fox Sports Central (; a title kept from SportsCenter days) focused on local sports news and events in Taiwan, and the updates of athletes from Taiwan. Also, the program presented daily highlights of games which Fox Sports Taiwan had broadcasting rights.\n\nMalaysia \nA Malaysian version of SportsCenter was launched on April 30, 2007. Initially presented in English, SportsCenter Malaysia aired immediately before SportsCenter Asia, from 7pm local time. It promised to focus more on local sports in Malaysia but instead repeated most of the same content seen on SportsCenter Asia with only a brief domestic sports section to keep costs down. For a short time, SportsCenter Malaysia used to be featured on all Southeast Asian versions of ESPN, before being limited to only been shown on ESPN in Malaysia.\n\nSportsCenter Malaysia had a Bahasa Malaysia version, which also repeated much of the same content shown on SportsCenter Asia. The Bahasa Malaysia program began on November 30, 2009 ahead of the launch of a Bahasa Malaysia competitor, Astro Arena, in March 2010. Former SportsCenter personalities Rashid Salleh and Edleen Ismail soon departed from ESPN to join Astro, along with many technical and production staff. On December 9, 2010, the Malaysia office was informed that the operation would be soon closing down because of a lack of funding. Senior managers Huw Bevan and Sharon Van Zwieten, visiting from Singapore, read off a prepared script to dismiss each staff member, one-by-one. The final broadcast was eight days later on December 17, 2010.\n\nIndia \nOriginally a Hindi-language show, Sportscenter India first aired in English on October 6, 2003. It switched back to Hindi on July 18, 2005, before being relaunched in English on April 28, 2007.\n\nSportscenter India featured local Indian sporting news, such as the results of cricket matches and local football (I-League). Sportscenter India also covered league matches from European football and also some new from NBA. Other sports like Auto Racing, Multi-sporting events and all where India participated were covered in this news. Much of the content from SportsCenter Asia was also repeated in SportsCenter India. The Indian edition was discontinued.\n\nSee also\n SportsCenter Philippines\n\nReferences\n\nFox Sports\nSportsCenter\n2000s American television news shows\nEnglish-language television shows\nHindi-language television shows\nSports television series", "machine_abstract": "SportsCenter is the flagship sports news program of ESPN International, which airs in over 100 countries and territories worldwide on television networks including ABC Australia (in English), Fox Sports Networks (Fox Sports 1 & 2) across North America, Sky News Network in New Zealand, SuperSport Worldwide Africa, SuperSport Worldwide Europe, SuperSport Worldwide Middle East, SuperSport Worldwide South Africa, SuperSport WorldWide India, SuperSport Worldwide Southeast Asia, SuperSport Worldwide West Indies, SuperSport Worldwide Caribbean Islands, SuperSport Worldwide Latin America, SuperSport Worldwide Russia, SuperSport Worldwide Turkey, SuperSport Worldwide Ukraine, SuperSport Worldwide Israel, SuperSport Worldwide Japan, SuperSport Worldwide Korea, SuperSport Worldwide Taiwan, SuperSport Worldwide Hong Kong, SuperSport Worldwide Indonesia, SuperSport Worldwide Malaysia, SuperSport Worldwide Philippines, SuperSport Worldwide Thailand, SuperSport Worldwide Vietnam, SuperSport Worldwide Myanmar/Burma/Myanmar, SuperSport Worldwide Cambodia, SuperSport Worldwide Laos, SuperSport Worldwide Brunei Darussalam, SuperSport Worldwide Guam/Saipan/Tinian, SuperSport Worldwide Samoa/Auckland/Niu Gini, SuperSport Worldwide Tonga, SuperSport Worldwide Vanuatu, SuperSport Worldwide Western Samoa, SuperSport Worldwide Fiji, SuperSport Worldwide Papua New Guinea, SuperSport Worldwide Northern Mariana Islands/Guam, SuperSport Worldwide Micronesia, SuperSport Worldwide Palau, SuperSport Worldwide Marshall Islands, SuperSport World Wide Afghanistan, SuperSport Worldwide Azerbaijan, SuperSport Worldwide Bahrain, SuperSport Worldwide Georgia, SuperSport Worldwide Kazakhstan, SuperSport Worldwide Kyrgyzstan, SuperSport Worldwide Tajikistan, SuperSport Worldwide Turkmenistan, SuperSport Worldwide Uzbekistan.\nThe show was launched as \"ESPN Sportscast\" by former Australian broadcaster Stan James in 1995 to coincide with the launch of its first satellite channel, ESPN Classic Television.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"SportsCenter Asia\".

The reason for establishing the Yeshiva is that the Israeli nation needs a different Yeshiva that would underline the values of social leadership, military leadership together with giving and caring for the city of Modi'in and the state of israel.\nIn 2011 the Yeshiva has opened a Jewish library in memory of Avner Goldman z\"l, an Israeli religious air force pilot who lived in Modi'in. Avner was killed during a training flight in Romania.  His family donated the library.\n\nIn the end of 2013, the Yeshiva opened a branch in the city Ofakim, israel.\n\nThe military service \nThe Yeshiva has two main programs.  All programs start with a year and a half of studying in the yeshiva.\n the regular service\nthis program contains a 10-month service in IDF, 10 months of learning,\nanother year of military service and ending with two years of learning.\n the commanders service\nthis program contains an 11-month service in IDF, 8 months of learning,\na bit more than a year of military service and ending with to full years of learning.\nMost students that become commanders continue to be officers.  They come back only in the last year and their second army period is two years. On 14.02.13, Orthodox Israeli website reported \"Srugim\" that more than 50% of soldiers that are part of the program led by the Yeshiva, are combat IDF commanders.\n Military paramedics program\nIn 2013, the Yeshiva, MDA and IDF, have conceived a program based on the military service program in the Yeshiva, allowing orthodox youth MDA volunteers to join the IDF through the Yeshiva and be trained as Military paramedics. The reason for this is the lack of IDF paramedics.\n\nIn total: both programs are six-year programs.\n\nThe religious advantage \nThe learning time is extended and allows to grow religious scholars(Hebrew: תלמידי חכמים)\n\nThe military advantage \nThe Military service is extended by half a year more than the usual Hesder program.\nstudents would not be asked to leave the program if they wish to become officers, as done in some Yeshivot.\n\nShahak Lebnei Hamitzva and community relations \n\nThe Yeshiva's goal is to \"educate its students to follow in the path of Harav Kook זצ\"ל , to love the Torah, with a diligent devotion to deep Torah learning, Jewish Leadership, and love of the land and the nation.\"\n\nThe Yeshiva has a very tight relationship with the community of Modi'in, that is expressed by a variety of  activities that are held by both Yeshiva and community.\n\nOne of the projects organized   by the Yeshiva is called \"Shahak Lebnei Hamitzva\" in memory of Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a partner in establishing the Yeshiva, addressed to young boys, at age 13 from the secular sector in Modi'in.  The project, (that had been established while Lipkin-Shahak was alive, and was then simply called \"Bar Mitzvah Project\")  includes increased preparation classes taught, along with group lessons on Jewish identity, Jewish values, Jewish history, and practical volunteer work. At the end, the students, along with their parents, tutors and instructors, go on a guided tour of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.  At the end of the tour there is a group Aliyah Latorah (a Jewish custom) (in addition to those in private) and a festival lunch in honor of the mitzvah.  By 2013 there had been over a thousand trainees in the project.\n\nSee also \n Hesder Yeshiva\n\nReferences \n\nOri pollak, שלוחה של ישיבת ההסדר במודיעין תוקם באופקים\nAmichai Rubin, ישיבת ההסדר במודיעין: חצי ישיבה מפקדים קרביים\n\nExternal links \n the Yeshivas site (hebrew)\n the Yeshivas site (English)\n the Yeshivas youtube page\n Lt.

The Simoncouche Lake straddles the unorganized territory of Lac-Ministuk, and that of the city of Saguenay, in the administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.\n\nLac Simoncouche is located in the northwestern part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, as well as in the Simoncouche teaching and research forest (FERS) of the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. The FERS covers an area of 27 square kilometers. A rest area has been built near the Québec-Chicoutimi road, allowing you to appreciate the wilderness of the site.\n\nThis small valley is served by the route 170 (boulevard Talbot) and some secondary roads for the needs of forestry, recreational tourism activities.\n\nForestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.\n\nThe surface of Lake Simoncouche is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.\n\nGeography \nThe main watersheds near Lake Simoncouche are:\n north side: Kenogami Lake, Chicoutimi River, rivière-aux-Sables, Saguenay River;\n east side: Lac William brook, Henriette brook, Chiens brook, Bras Henriette, Bras de Jacob Ouest, rivière du Moulin;\n south side: lac des Îlets, Cyriac River, Valiquette lake, Cyriac lake, Bras Sec.\n west side: Cyriac River, Normand River, Hector brook, Chicoutimi River.\n\nThe Lake Simoncouche has a length of , a width of  and an altitude of . This lake is made in length by a widening of the Simoncouche River which crosses it towards the north; this lake has three parts formed by two narrowing. This lake is located in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve in the massif of Laurentian Mountains.\n\nThis lake is mainly fed by the Simoncouche River (coming from the south) and by the outlet (coming from the east) from Lac du Dépôt and Lac Hautbois. The mouth of this lake is located at:\n  east of route 175;\n  south-east of Barrière-de-Laterrière;\n  north-east of a curve in the course of the Cyriac River;\n  south of the confluence of the Simoncouche River and Kenogami Lake;\n  west of the course of Bras de Jacob Ouest;\n  south-west of the course of the rivière du Moulin.\n\nFrom the mouth of Lake Simoncouche, the current follows the course of the Simoncouche River consecutively over  north to the confluence with Kenogami Lake; it crosses this lake for  north-east to Portage-des-Roches dam; it follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on  to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on  east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.\n\nToponymy \nThe name \"Lac Simoncouche\" appeared in the Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec in 1914, when the river was called \"Moncouche\". These two toponymic names seem popular, as much for the river as the bay; the most commonly used designations have been formalized.\n\nThe name Moncouche comes from Muakush, an Amerindian word meaning sea eagle. The origin of the first syllable \"si\" is unknown as is its meaning.\n\nThe toponym Lac Simoncouche was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.\n\nSee also\n\n Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality\n Lac-Ministuk, an unorganized territory\n Saguenay, a city\n Saguenay River\n Chicoutimi River\n Kenogami Lake\n Simoncouche River\n List of lakes in Canada\n\nReferences \n\nRivers of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean\nGeography of Saguenay, Quebec\nLe Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality\nLaurentides Wildlife Reserve", "machine_abstract": "Simoncouche is the largest lake in northern Quebec, Canada and one of its most remote lakes as well.\nIt lies on the north shore of Hudson Bay at latitude 60°N (Nunavik), about 300 km east-northeast from Schefferville.

{"id": "Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel%20single-source%20shortest%20path%20algorithm", "title": "Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm", "text": "A central problem in algorithmic graph theory is the shortest path problem. One of the generalizations of the shortest path problem is known as the single-source-shortest-paths (SSSP) problem, which consists of finding the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph. There are classical sequential algorithms which solve this problem, such as Dijkstra's algorithm. In this article, however, we present two parallel algorithms solving this problem.\n\nAnother variation of the problem is the all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) problem, which also has parallel approaches: Parallel all-pairs shortest path algorithm.\n\nProblem definition \nLet  be a directed graph with  nodes and  edges. Let  be a distinguished vertex (called \"source\") and  be a function assigning a non-negative real-valued weight to each edge. The goal of the single-source-shortest-paths problem is to compute, for every vertex  reachable from , the weight of a minimum-weight path from  to , denoted by  and abbreviated . The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its edges. We set  if  is unreachable from .\n\nSequential shortest path algorithms commonly apply iterative labeling methods based on maintaining a tentative distance for all nodes;  is always  or the weight of some path from  to  and hence an upper bound on . Tentative distances are improved by performing edge relaxations, i.e., for an edge   the algorithm sets .\n\nFor all parallel algorithms we will assume a PRAM model with concurrent reads and concurrent writes.\n\nDelta stepping algorithm \nThe delta stepping algorithm is a label-correcting algorithm, which means the tentative distance of a vertex can be corrected several times via edge relaxations until the last step of the algorithm, when all tentative distances are fixed.\n\nThe algorithm maintains eligible nodes with tentative distances in an array of buckets each of which represents a distance range of size . During each phase, the algorithm removes all nodes of the first nonempty bucket and relaxes all outgoing edges of weight at most . Edges of a higher weight are only relaxed after their respective starting nodes are surely settled. The parameter   is a positive real number that is also called the \"step width\" or \"bucket width\".\n\nParallelism is obtained by concurrently removing all nodes of the first nonempty bucket and relaxing their outgoing light edges in a single phase. If a node  has been removed from the current bucket  with non-final distance value then, in some subsequent phase,  will eventually be reinserted into  , and the outgoing light edges of   will be re-relaxed. The remaining heavy edges emanating from all nodes that have been removed from  so far are relaxed once and for all when  finally remains empty. Subsequently, the algorithm searches for the next nonempty bucket and proceeds as described above.\n\nThe maximum shortest path weight for the source node  is defined as , abbreviated . Also, the size of a path is defined to be the number of edges on the path.\n\nWe distinguish light edges from heavy edges, where light edges have weight at most   and heavy edges have weight bigger than  .\n\nFollowing is the delta stepping algorithm in pseudocode:\n 1  foreach  do \n 2  ;                                                    (*Insert source node with distance 0*)\n 3  while  do                                         (*A phase: Some queued nodes left (a)*)\n 4  |                                     (*Smallest nonempty bucket (b)*)\n 5  |                                                        (*No nodes deleted for bucket B[i] yet*)\n 6  | while  do                                             (*New phase (c)*)\n 7  | |                             (*Create requests for light edges (d)*)\n 8  | |                                                (*Remember deleted nodes (e)*)\n 9  | |                                                     (*Current bucket empty*)\n 10 | |                                          (*Do relaxations, nodes may (re)enter B[i] (f)*)\n 11 |                                 (*Create requests for heavy edges (g)*)\n 12 |                                            (*Relaxations will not refill B[i] (h)*)\n 13\n 14 Function :set of Request\n 15   return \n 16\n 17 Procedure \n 18   foreach  do \n 19\n 20 Procedure                                              (*Insert or move w in B if x<\\operatorname{tent}(w)*)\n 21  if  then\n 22  |                        (*If in, remove from old bucket*)\n 23  |                                    (*Insert into new bucket*)\n 24  |\n\nExample \n\nFollowing is a step by step description of the algorithm execution for a small example graph. The source vertex is the vertex A and  is equal to 3.\n\nAt the beginning of the algorithm, all vertices except for the source vertex A have infinite tentative distances.\n\nBucket  has range , bucket  has range  and bucket  has range .\n\nThe bucket  contains the vertex A. All other buckets are empty.\n\nThe algorithm relaxes all light edges incident to , which are the edges connecting A to B, G and E.\n\nThe vertices B,G and E are inserted into bucket . Since  is still empty, the heavy edge connecting A to D is also relaxed.\n\nNow the light edges incident to  are relaxed. The vertex C is inserted into bucket . Since now  is empty, the heavy edge connecting E to F can be relaxed.\n\nOn the next step, the bucket  is examined, but doesn't lead to any modifications to the tentative distances.\n\nThe algorithm terminates.\n\nRuntime \nAs mentioned earlier,  is the maximum shortest path weight.\n\nLet us call a path with total weight at most  and without edge repetitions a -path.\n\nLet  denote the set of all node pairs  connected by some -path   and let . Similarly, define  as the set of triples  such that  and  is a light edge and let .\n\nThe sequential delta-stepping algorithm needs at most operations. A simple parallelization runs in time  .\n\nIf we take  for graphs with maximum degree  and random edge weights uniformly distributed in , the sequential version of the algorithm needs  total average-case time and a simple parallelization takes on average .\n\nGraph 500 \nThe third computational kernel of the Graph 500 benchmark runs a single-source shortest path computation. The reference implementation of the Graph 500 benchmark uses the delta stepping algorithm for this computation.\n\nRadius stepping algorithm \nFor the radius stepping algorithm, we must assume that our graph  is undirected.\n\nThe input to the algorithm is a weighted, undirected graph, a source vertex, and a target radius value for every vertex, given as a function . The algorithm visits vertices in increasing distance from the source .  On each step , the Radius-Stepping increments the radius centered at  from  to  , and settles all vertices  in the annulus .\n\nFollowing is the radius stepping algorithm in pseudocode:\n     Input: A graph , vertex radii , and a source node .\n     Output: The graph distances  from .\n  1  , \n  2  foreach  do , , \n  3  while  do\n  4  | \n  5  | repeat   \n  6  | | foreach  s.t  do\n  7  | | | foreach  do\n  8  | | | | \n  9  | until no  was updated\n  10 | \n  11 | \n  12 return \nFor all , define  to be the neighbor set of S. During the execution of standard breadth-first search or Dijkstra's algorithm, the frontier is the neighbor set of all visited vertices.\n\nIn the Radius-Stepping algorithm, a new round distance  is decided on each round with the goal of bounding the number of substeps. The algorithm takes a radius  for each vertex and selects a  on step  by taking the minimum  over all  in the frontier (Line 4).\n\nLines 5-9 then run the Bellman-Ford substeps until all vertices with radius less than  are settled. Vertices within  are then added to the visited set .\n\nExample \n\nFollowing is a step by step description of the algorithm execution for a small example graph. The source vertex is the vertex A and the radius of every vertex is equal to 1.\n\nAt the beginning of the algorithm, all vertices except for the source vertex A have infinite tentative distances, denoted by  in the pseudocode.\n\nAll neighbors of A are relaxed and .\n\nThe variable  is chosen to be equal to 4 and the neighbors of the vertices B, E and G are relaxed. \n\nThe variable  is chosen to be equal to 6 and no values are changed. .\n\nThe variable  is chosen to be equal to 9 and no values are changed. .\n\nThe algorithm terminates.\n\nRuntime \nAfter a preprocessing phase, the radius stepping algorithm can solve the SSSP problem in  work and   depth, for . In addition, the preprocessing phase takes   work and   depth, or  work and   depth.\n\nReferences \n\nGraph theory", "machine_abstract": "The parallel single source shortest paths problem is the computational task of finding all pairs of nodes in a graph that are connected by a shortest path, where each node has its own weight and there may be multiple edges between two nodes.\nThis can also be viewed as computing the distance matrix or Floyd–Warshall's all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) algorithm on graphs whose edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality property.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm\".

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Panetolikos. The stadium is located at Prousiotissis Street and it holds a capacity of 7,321 all-seated. Its highest attendance was 11,012 during a match against Olympiakos in 1977. There are plans to increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 11,000 in the future if necessary. Nowadays the average attendance is 5,000 (6,288 after expansion completion). Even though Agrinio is small city, Panetolikos supporters known as \"The Warriors\" are well known for their loyalty for the team.\n\nInfo\nThe stadium has two stands along the sides of the pitch. It has been used as a football ground since 1930, however the first stand (the small east one) was not constructed until the mid-'50s. The main west stand was built in the 1970s. Unfortunately, in the years that followed, little else happened to the stadium, which gradually fell into disrepair. This was the situation until 2005, when the new owners of the club revealed their plans for the complete reconstruction of the stadium. The stadium features also team's offices, boutique and cafes.\n\nWork has begun after the promotion of the team to the Superleague division, in order to increase the capacity of the stadium by 1400 seats approximately behind Prousiotissis Street goalpost (a Curva). Thus the Panetolikos' pitch will have three stands. Additional lighting and a scoreboard will be added over the next months. Recently the addition of extra lighting was complete, with the overall power of lights at 1600 lux, which satisfy the Greek Superleague and UEFA requirements. Additionally a scoreboard is added at 2017.\n\nExternal links \nPhotos at the Panetolikos website\nPanaetolikos Stadium at stadia.gr\n\nFootball venues in Greece\nAgrinio\nBuildings and structures in Aetolia-Acarnania\nSports venues in Western Greece", "machine_abstract": "The Panetolikos Stadium is the home stadium of Greek football club Panetolikos Athens, located in Neo Faliro area near Athens International Airport and next to the Olympic Stadium (Olympic Stadium).", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Panetolikos Stadium\".

It is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, who donated 281 books to the library after his death in 1447. Sections of the libraries were restored and expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries, including the addition of a second storey, an east wing and a west wing. The library currently functions as an additional reading room for the Bodleian Library.\n\nHistory\n\nDuke Humfrey's Library is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of Henry IV of England. He was a connoisseur of literature and commissioned translations of classical works from Greek into Latin. When he died in 1447, he donated his collection of 281 books to the University of Oxford. At the time, this was considered an incredibly generous donation as the university only had 20 books. All classes at that time were taught via oral lectures; books were handwritten and were only for the extremely wealthy. \n\nThe library was constructed as a second storey to the Divinity School between 1450 and 1480 in order to house the donated collection. In 1550, during the Reformation, the King's Commissioners despoiled the library of books in order to destroy the vestiges of Roman Catholicism in the country. The books were probably burnt, and in 1556 the furniture was removed by the university. Today, only three of Humfrey's original books remain in the library.\n\nThe Library was refitted and restored from 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley and between 1610 and 1612, the east wing (now the Arts End) was added. The west wing (now the Selden End) was built 20 years later. The books in the oldest part are accommodated in oak bookcases which are at right angles to the walls on either side with integral readers' desks. The ceiling consists of panels painted with the arms of the university. Up until the opening of the new Weston Library in 2015, Duke Humfrey's Library functioned as a reading room for maps, music and pre-1641 rare books; it now serves as an additional reading room for users of the Bodleian Library.\n\nCollections \nServing as an additional reading room for all users of the Bodleian, the Library consists of the original medieval section (1487), the Arts End (1612), and the Selden End (1637). It houses collections of maps, music, Western manuscripts, and theology and art materials. It is the main reading room for researchers of codicology, bibliography and local history, as well as it containing the University Archives and the Conservative Party Archive.\n\nThe Library is on the first floor and forms an H-shape with the later parts as the uprights. The Arts End is above the Proscholium and is attached at two corners to the Old Schools Quadrangle. The medieval section is above the Divinity School and Selden End (named after John Selden a benefactor of the library) is above the Convocation House. \n\nA drawing of the medieval section with the Divinity School below in isolation is used as the emblem of the Bodleian Library. \n\nDuke Humfrey's Library was used as the Hogwarts Library in the Harry Potter films.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nBodleian Library", "machine_abstract": "The Duke Humfrey’s Library is the oldest surviving library in Oxford, England and was founded by William Marshal (died 1219), 1st Earl of Pembroke as part of his college at New College, Oxford.

The company's first line ran from Philadelphia to Allentown via Reading (1846), then extended southward through Lancaster County into York County where it connected at Port Clinton Junction near present-day Karthaus Township.   In 1852, the railroad reached Harrisburg;  two years later, it reached Carthaus Township.    By 1860, the railway system included lines extending as far west as Pittsburgh and north to Erie.\nIn 1864, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted the EPRR exclusive rights over all roads within 10 miles (16 km) of any point served by one of their tracks.   This act gave them control over most rural highways throughout eastern Pennsylvania until they were replaced by state highways during the 20th century.   It also allowed them to build branch lines without competition.   During this period, the company built many new branches including those leading east toward Gettysburg and Chambersburg, and west towards Altoona and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.   They also constructed numerous bridges across streams such as the Susquehanna River between Harrisburg and Middletown, which is still standing today.   On December 1, 1867, the name of the corporation changed to \"The Pennsylvania Railway Company\";   however, the old name continued to be used informally among locals who referred to \"the roads\" or simply \"the tracks\".   After acquiring additional land grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the PRR expanded further into western Pennsylvania reaching Scranton in 1872 and Cumberland Gap in 1876.   Between 1877 and 1883, the PRR completed construction of the Lehigh Valley Extension connecting the mainline directly to Bethlehem Steel Works located just outside of Allentown.

The company's first line ran from Philadelphia to Allentown via Reading (1846), then extended southward through Lancaster County into York County where it connected at Port Clinton Junction near present-day Karthaus Township.   In 1852, the railroad reached Harrisburg;  two years later, it reached Carthaus Township.    By 1860, the railway system included lines extending as far west as Pittsburgh and north to Erie.\nIn 1864, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted the EPRR exclusive rights over all roads within 10 miles (16 km) of any point served by one of their tracks.   This act gave them control over most rural highways throughout eastern Pennsylvania until they were replaced by state highways during the 20th century.   It also allowed them to build branch lines without competition.   During this period, the company built many new branches including those leading east toward Gettysburg and Chambersburg, and west towards Altoona and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.   They also constructed numerous bridges across streams such as the Susquehanna River between Harrisburg and Middletown, which is still standing today.   On December 1, 1867, the name of the corporation changed to \"The Pennsylvania Railway Company\";   however, the old name continued to be used informally among locals who referred to \"the roads\" or simply \"the tracks\".   After acquiring additional land grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the PRR expanded further into western Pennsylvania reaching Scranton in 1872 and Cumberland Gap in 1876.   Between 1877 and 1883, the PRR completed construction of the Lehigh Valley Extension connecting the mainline directly to Bethlehem Steel Works located just outside of Allentown.

The performance artwork was created in 2015 through a public and participatory performance, or happening, on the esplanade of Franco's Monument to the Fallen in Pamplona. Azcona invited dozens of relatives of Republicans who were shot, persecuted or disappeared during the Spanish Civil War. Descendants of victims make up the installation in a row in front of the monument, all symbolically buried with soil from the garden of one of the participants, where his relatives had been shot. In 2016 the city of Pamplona invited Azcona to show his work inside the Monument and the project was recreated inside the Monument, which had been converted into an exhibition hall, under the name of Unearthed: A retrospective view on the political and subversive work of the artist Abel Azcona. The exhibition brought together the Buried project and fragments of all of Azcona's works.\n\nIn 2016, Azcona coordinated a new performative action, or happening, with relatives of those who were shot in the Pozos de Caudé. Under the name of Desafectos, Azcona formed a wall with the relatives as a complaint, next to the wells outside the city of Teruel, where more than a thousand people had been shot and thrown into the wells over the course of three days during the Civil War.\n\nBibliography\n\nSee also \n\n Performance Art\n Installation\n Endurance art\n\nReferences\n\nPerformances", "machine_abstract": "Buried is the first performance by artist Paul McCarthy, which was performed in 1966 at The Kitchen Gallery of New York City's East Village neighborhood and documented on film.

He was born in Budapest, and worked many years in Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden, both as violinist and as a conductor.\n\nLife and career \nGaraguly was a child prodigy, performing in public from the age of 6, having received his first violin lessons from his father. By the age of 10 he was undertaking concert tours.\n\nHe studied violin with Jenő Hubay at the Hungarian State Academy in 1907-08, and with Henri Marteau at the Berlin High School for Music from 1914–16, and was a member of the Marteau Society. \nAged 17 he became the assistant deputy leader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. During war service he made concert tours for the Red Cross before teaching for a time at the Conservatory of Arad, Transylvannia.\n\nGaraguly moved to Sweden in 1923 and from that year until 1930 he was the leader of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and also first violin of the Gothenburg Quartet.\nGaraguly began his association with the Stockholm Concert Society (today the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1930 as deputy leader, in which post he also performed solos in concert works by Mozart, Wieniawski, Pergament, Berwald, Mendelssohn and Hubay.\nHe continued as deputy leader up until being appointed principal conductor of the orchestra from 1942 until 1953. \nHaving studied conducting with Clemens Krauss he had made his debut as conductor in March 1940, having previously conducted two schools concerts. During his tenure he led nearly 300 concerts, as well 100 school or youth concerts. He conducted two concerts in London in 1952 during the orchestra's visit. Garaguly's appointment was not universally welcomed, with some criticizing the orchestra board for not giving the job to Tor Mann. In addition, Kurt Atterberg attacked Garaguly’s nomination because he was not born in Sweden (although he had lived there for half his life and was married to a Swedish woman).\nHis primary repertoire interest was modern music, but he also conducted the major classics. His rehearsal and preparation was much admired and the orchestra became more reliable technically during his tenure. His final appearance conducting the orchestra was on 26 October 1982.\n \nGaraguly was named music director of Harmonien (the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1952. He was conductor of the Arnhem Symphony Orchestra (officially called Het Gelders Orkest (HGO) in Dutch) from 1959-1972, and the Sønderjyllands Symfoniorkester in Denmark from 1965 to 1979, while also returning to Stockholm to guest conduct.\n\nHe gave the premiere of the symphony of Anne-Marie Ørbeck in 1954 in Bergen.\n\nDiscography \nBerlin Classics have issued recordings of Garaguly conducting the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra in Sibelius Symphonies 1 and 7, the Háry János Suite by Kodály, pieces by Johann Strauss and a suite from Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk district, Op. 29 by Shostakovich.\nIn their series of violin concertos with Kai Laursen, Danacord has several where the conductor is Garaguly leading the South Jutland Symphony Orchestra: Concerto for Violin in A major, Op. 6 by Svendsen, Concerto for Violin in G major by Ludvig Holm, Concerto for Violin in D major, Op. 20 by Peder Gram, Concerto for Violin in G major, Op. 11 by Hakon Børresen, Concerto for Violin in D major by Enna, Concerto for Violin in B minor, Op. 27 by Gustav Helsted, Concerto for Violin, Op. 48 by Emborg and the Chamber Concerto no 9 for Violin and Viola, Op. 39 by Holmboe.\nCarl Nielsen's Symphony No 2 and Suite for String Orchestra were recorded by Garaguly with the Tivoli Orchestra (Vox). Other discs listed by CHARM are Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 with Victor Schiøler, piano (1945, Tono), Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major also with Schiøler, (1947 HMV), Brahms Symphony No. 1 by the Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin (1957 Eterna), Sibelius Tapiola, also in Berlin, Lars-Erik Larsson's Music for orchestra, Op. 40 and Hilding Rosenberg's Concerto for string orchestra. A recording of Garaguly conducting for Jussi Björling on 9 June 1954 in Bergen has been issued on the Bluebell label.\n\nAs leader of the Garaguly Quartet, he is heard in recordings of Stenhammar's String Quartet No. 5 in C major, Op. 29, Atterberg's String quartet in B, Op 11/2, Larsson's Intima Miniatyrer Op. 20, and Rosenberg's String Quartet No 4.\n\nOn one disk of Caprice CAP 21620 a range of his solo violin recordings have been reissued.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Biography (in Swedish)\n\nHungarian conductors (music)\nHungarian male musicians\nMale conductors (music)\nHungarian nobility\nHungarian classical violinists\nMale classical violinists\nHungarian expatriates in Sweden\nMusicians from Budapest\n20th-century conductors (music)\n1900 births\n1984 deaths\n20th-century classical violinists\nPeople of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra (formerly known as the Stockholm Concert Society)\n20th-century Swedish male musicians", "machine_abstract": "Carl von Garaguly (born September 16, 1881 in Vienna) was the Austrian-born American architect who designed many of New York City's most famous skyscrapers and apartment buildings during his career from 1914 to 1939.\nGaraguly studied architecture at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna before moving to Paris where he worked under Auguste Perret on several projects including the reconstruction after World War I of the Hôtel de Ville in Reims.

{"id": "The Optimists of Nine Elms", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Optimists%20of%20Nine%20Elms", "title": "The Optimists of Nine Elms", "text": "The Optimists of Nine Elms, also known as The Optimists, is a 1973 British drama film starring Peter Sellers and directed by Anthony Simmons, who also wrote the 1964 novel upon which the film is based. The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role.\n\nMullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school\n\nPlot\n\nThe story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets.\n\nBegrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the Hyde Park pet cemetery, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and “only dogs can be depended upon”. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one.\n\nThe following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for. \nThe children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as “he wasn’t their grandfather”, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree.\n\nThe following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.\n\nCast\n Peter Sellers as Sam  \n Donna Mullane as Liz  \n John Chaffey as Mark  \n David Daker as Bob Ellis\n Marjorie Yates as Chrissie Ellis  \n Patricia Brake as Dogs Home Secretary\n Don Crown as Busker\n Michael Graham Cox as Park Keeper\n Bruce Purchase as Policeman\n Pat Ashton as Woman at Nursery\n Keith Chegwin as Georgie (uncredited)\n Hilary Pritchard as Laundry lady (uncredited)\n\nNovel and screenplay\nSimmons is said to have planned the film around the time his two award-winning short films Sunday By the Sea (1953) and Bow Bells (1954) were released. Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works.  Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety wrote, \"It all sounds like goo, and the film’s last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\" while The New York Times described the film as \"the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker. And commendably, he submerges himself sufficiently in the part to allow old Sam to have a life of his own.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1974 films\nBritish films\nBritish drama films\n1973 drama films\n1973 films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms directed by Anthony Simmons\nFilms based on British novels\nFilms scored by George Martin\nFilms set in London\n1974 drama films\nNine Elms", "machine_abstract": "The film is set in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, where it follows two young men who are trying to make their way through life despite being born into different social classes.\nIt was shot on location throughout south-east England including at The National Theatre (in Trafalgar Square), Battersea Power Station, Pimlico Road, Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Waterloo East End Arts Centre, Kings Cross station, Elephant & Castle railway station, Camden Lock Market, Primrose Hill Park, Regent's Canal, Chelsea Bridge, King's College Hospital, University of Kent, Canterbury Christ Church University, Medway Maritime Museum, Rochester Castle, Chatham Historic Dockyard, Dover Harbour Boardwalk, Folkestone Westgate Shopping Mall, Margate Pier, Ramsgate Beach House Hotel, Romney Marsh Railway Line, Ashford International Rail Terminal, Dartmoor Prison, HMP Weare near Petersfield, Hampshire; as well as locations across Europe such as Paris' La Défense business district, Amsterdam Centraal train station, Prague Old Town square, Berlin Alexanderplatz, Cologne Dom cathedral, Hamburg HafenCity harbour area, Munich Viktualienmarkt market place, Vienna State Opera house, Salzburg Fortress Hohensalzburg castle, Venice Grand Canal, Florence Ponte Vecchio bridge, Pisa Leaning Tower, Vatican City Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore church, Rome Colosseum, Pompeii Forum, Naples Piazza del Plebiscito square, Palermo Teatro Politeama opera house, Sicily Taormina town centre, Athens Acropolis hill", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"The Optimists of Nine Elms\".

{"id": "Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar%20collateral%20ligament%20injury%20of%20the%20elbow", "title": "Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow", "text": "Ulnar collateral ligament injuries can occur during certain activities such as overhead baseball pitching. Acute or chronic disruption and/or attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament often result in medial elbow pain, valgus instability, neurologic deficiency, and impaired throwing performance. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatment options.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nPain along the inside of the elbow is the main symptom of this condition. Throwing athletes report it occurs most often during the acceleration phase of throwing. Closing the hand and clenching the fist has also been shown to reproduce the painful symptoms. The injury is often associated with an experience of a sharp “pop” in the elbow, followed by pain during a single throw.  In addition, swelling and bruising of the elbow, loss of elbow range of motion, and a sudden decrease in throwing velocity are all common symptoms of a UCL injury. If the injury is less severe, pain can be minimal with complete rest.\n\nCauses\nThe UCL is important because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among baseball pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery. Gridiron football, racquet sports, ice hockey and water polo players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Specific overhead movements like those that occur during baseball pitching, tennis serving or volleyball spiking increase the risk of UCL injury. During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing strain. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs at the conclusion of the arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90° to approximately 125°. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125° to 25° at ball release. This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as curveballs. Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, micro-tears or ruptures of the UCL.  Kinetic chain dysfunction due to poor lower extremity strength, core strength and stability can be associated with UCL injuries as well as capsular stiffness in glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), and scapular dyskinesis. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time.\n\nAnatomy\n\nThe ulnar collateral ligament (UCL, also known as medial collateral ligament) is located on the medial side of the elbow. The UCL complex comprises three ligaments: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments. The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial epicondyle to the medial ulnar surface slightly below the coronoid process. It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against valgus stress at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial semilunar notch. It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon. Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint’s stability.\n\nDiagnosis\nIn most cases, a physician will diagnose an ulnar collateral ligament injury using a patient’s medical history and a physical examination that includes a valgus stress test. The valgus stress test is performed on both arms and a positive test is indicated by pain on the affected arm that is not present on the uninvolved side.  Physicians often utilize imaging techniques such as ultrasound, x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic surgery to aid with making a proper diagnosis.\n\nClassification\nA slow and chronic deterioration of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to repetitive stress acting on the ulna.  At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete’s career.  The repetitive stress placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting in the loss of structural integrity over time.  The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury.  The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in flexion such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football.  The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow.  This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the radioulnar joints.\n\nTreatments\n\nUCL injuries may or may not require surgery.  Non surgical treatment will primarily focus on strengthening the elbow joint to regain strength and stability. First a course of \nRICE (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling.  When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL. These may include biceps curls (non resistance and resistance), pronating and supinating the forearm, and grip strengthening exercises, performed with low resistance and moderate repetitions no more than three times a week.\n\nSurgical treatment may help restore the ability to perform the overhand throwing motions most commonly associated with UCL injuries. The reconstructive surgery, generally known as Tommy John surgery, was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and has modified several times over the past 30 years. The surgery involves an autograft of the palmaris longus tendon (mostly seen as an accessory tendon) or an allograft of tissue from a cadaver or donor.  The new tendon is attached by drilling holes in the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the sublime tubercle of the ulna and lacing the tendon through them in a figure eight. The patient may begin physical therapy shortly after. It usually takes about 15 months after the surgery for standard rehabilitation. Rehabilitation following UCL injuries or surgery should follow a sequential and progressive multi-phased approach that involves a gradual and protected return of range-of-motion (ROM). The rehab program should include proprioceptive exercises to stimulate mechanoreceptors as well as arm strengthening, emphasizing proximal scapular stabilization. Low-resistance, high-repetition programs promote an optimal return to uncompensated throwing.  Post-operative treatment is related to the restoration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm, which begins with establishing trunk stability, elbow range of motion and strength as well as balance exercises.   In study conducted by Dr. Frederick Azar, 78 Tommy John surgeries were performed and analyzed after the surgeries. Of the 78 patients, 8 of them (8.8%) reported complications. Two patients had superficial infections that resolved with oral antibiotics, two patients reported tightness of tenderness at the surgery site, and one had a superficial wound infection at the elbow incision that resolved with oral antibiotics. One patient developed postoperative ulnar nerve damage. Two patients had damages to the posteromedial part of the olecranon and required to have reoperation.\n\nRecent studies have shown that MLB pitchers who undergo Tommy John surgery return to pitch in the MLB 83% of the time and only 3% fail to return to pitch in the MLB or the minor league.\n\nRecently, there has been a recorded increase of Tommy John surgery. The increase is related to the false perception that the surgery improves the stability of the UCL joint. Many athletes believe in this false perception and cause them to lie about their symptoms in hopes to undergo the surgery. In order to combat these rumors, physicians are motivated to educate the public that Tommy John surgeries are only for those who have severe UCL injuries. The surgery will have an insignificant effect if the patient does not have a severe UCL injury.\n\nThe tendon chosen is then woven in a figure eight pattern through the humerus and ulna, which holes were first drilled in the bones. After surgery occurs, rehabilitation comes into place and usually takes about a year  because a tendon needs time to convert into a ligament.\n\nEpidemiology\nAccording to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, in 2008 the U.S. listed the diagnosis code for UCL injury as 841.1: Sprain ulnar collateral ligament.  There were a total of 336 discharges of UCL injuries.  Within the total discharges, separated by age groups: 18- to 44-year-olds; 165 people (49.17%). 45- to 64-year-olds; 91 (27.08%). 65- to 84-year-olds, 65 (19.35%) it shows that the ulnar collateral ligament injuries were more commonly found in men than women.  There were 213 men compared to 123 women with ulnar collateral ligament injury.  Most of these injuries were also paid through private insurance (170: 50.63%) and Medicare (70: 20.85%).  The average estimated cost for the surgery also known as Tommy John surgery is $21,563.\n\nReferences \n\nLigaments of the upper limb\nInjuries", "machine_abstract": "The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is one of four major stabilizing structures in the human elbow joint, along with the medial and lateral collateral ligaments as well as the anterior cruciate ligament.\nInjury to this structure can be caused by overuse or trauma such as falling on outstretched hands.

Its principal subjects are interior design and landscaping, rather than pure external architecture. The magazine is published by Condé Nast, which also publishes international editions of Architectural Digest in Italy, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Spain, Mexico, and Latin America.\n\nArchitectural Digest is aimed at an affluent and style-conscious readership, and is subtitled \"The International Design Authority.\" The magazine releases the annual AD100 list, which recognizes the most influential interior designers and architects around the world. \n\nArchitectural Digest also hosts a popular online video series entitled Open Door that gives an in-depth look at the unique homes of various prominent celebrities and public figures.\n\nHistory\nOriginally a quarterly trade directory called The Architectural Digest: A Pictorial Digest of California's Best Architecture, the magazine was launched in 1920 by John Coke Brasfield (1880–1962). Brasfield, born in Tennessee, moved to southern California in the early 1900s, where he founded the John C. Brasfield Publishing Corporation in Los Angeles. Interiors and exteriors of residences were featured in the magazine, along with floor plans.\n\nBy 1963, the magazine's subtitle had been altered to A Pictorial Digest of Outstanding Architecture, Interior Design, and Landscaping, and it began publishing on a bimonthly schedule. In 1965, The Architectural Digest and its publishing company were purchased by Cleon T. Knapp, who was the magazine's \"jack-of-all-trades\" and Brasfield's grandson. Knapp son of Brasfield's daughter Sarah \"Sally\" Brasfield Knapp (1910–1996), who served, at various times, as the magazine's editor in chief, managing editor, and associate publisher. The magazine's subtitle was altered to The Quality Guide to Home Decorating Ideas in 1966, and was changed again, in 1971, to The Connoisseur's Magazine of Fine Interior Design, and in 1976 to The International Magazine of Fine Interior Design. The John C. Brasfield Publishing Company was renamed Knapp Communications Corporation in 1977.\n\nCondé Nast Publications purchased Architectural Digest, as well as its sister publication Bon Appétit, from Knapp in 1993.\n\nIn 2011 the Chinese version of the magazine, AD China, was launched. The magazine is also published in other countries, including Germany, India, France, Russia, Italy, United States and Spain.\n\nArchitectural Digest won the 2020 Webby People’s Voice Award for Architecture & Design in the category Web.\n\nEditors in chief\nJohn C. Brasfield, 1920–1960\n(James) Bradley Little 1960–1965; a former interior designer, who served as editorial director and editor in chief from 1964 until his death in 1971.\nCleon T. Knapp, 1965–1974 (also served as publisher during the same period)\nPaige Rense, 1975–2010; she previously served as the magazine's associate editor, 1968–1971, and its executive editor, 1971–1975. \nMargaret Russell, 2010–2016\nAmy Astley, 2016–present\n\nSince the 2010 change in leadership, the magazine has seen a shift towards featuring lighter, more open interiors, brighter photography, and a modern graphic style.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nVisual arts magazines published in the United States\nMonthly magazines published in the United States\nQuarterly magazines published in the United States\nArchitecture magazines\nCondé Nast magazines\nMagazines established in 1920\nMagazines published in New York City\nDesign magazines", "machine_abstract": "The following is the list of issues published by Architectural Digest, Inc., from its inception to present day (as of September 2014).

Since beginning his sentence, De Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former State President F. W. de Klerk, of permitting C10's activities. In 2015, he was granted parole, and is currently released .\n\nEarly life and service\nEugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a magistrate and personal friend to former prime minister John Vorster. Vosloo \"Vossie\" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a \"quiet\" boy who \"wasn't a violent person.\" He also recounted how their father, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond, indoctrinated the boys in Afrikaner nationalist ideology and taught them \"strict Afrikaans\" as they grew up.\n\nDe Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in Pretoria at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to Rhodesia's border with Botswana to confront militant ANC incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the South African Defence Force. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in Saldanha Bay because of a stutter, and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the South African Police's uniform branch in the Eastern Cape. \n\nDe Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, De Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant.\n\nIn May 1978, De Kock was transferred to South West Africa and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded Koevoet, an SAP counterinsurgency unit tasked with combating the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) during the South African Border War. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but committed atrocities against civilians and other human rights violations. Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.\n\nVlakplaas\n\nIn 1983, the SAP transferred De Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called Vlakplaas, located  west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10—later known as C1—became a death squad which hunted down and killed opponents of the National Party and the apartheid system.\n\nTRC testimony\nDe Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998, during which he made multiple revelations relating to ANC deaths.\n\nDe Kock has been interviewed a number of times by psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, who ended up releasing a book, A Human Being Died That Night, about her interviews with De Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentencing\nUpon being convicted on 30 October 1996, De Kock was sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison for crimes against humanity. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of a firearm, and fraud. De Kock served his sentence in the C Max section of the Pretoria Central Prison.\n\nImprisonment\nIn a local radio interview in July 2007, De Kock claimed that former president FW de Klerk's hands were \"soaked in blood\" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the anti-apartheid conflict. These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a \"clear conscience\" regarding his time in office.\n\nThe Sunday Independent reported in January 2010 that De Kock was seeking a presidential pardon from President Jacob Zuma in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated De Kock took place in April 2009. A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.\n\nIn 2012, De Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims. In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted De Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown remorse. In February, De Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.\n\nIn September 2014, De Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims. Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.\n\nParole\nJustice Minister Michael Masutha announced on 30 January 2015, that De Kock had been granted parole. At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public. Masutha further said that De Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims. De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.\n\nSee also\nDirk Coetzee\nCraig Williamson\nCivil Cooperation Bureau\nWouter Basson\nLothar Neethling\nJanusz Waluś\nSiphiwe Mvuyane\n\nReferences\n\n1949 births\nSouth African prisoners and detainees\nLiving people\nAfrikaner people\nPolice officers convicted of crimes against humanity\nSouth African people of Dutch descent\nSouth African people convicted of crimes against humanity\nPrisoners and detainees of South Africa\nSouth African police officers convicted of crimes\nPeople who testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)\nTorturers", "machine_abstract": "General information\n\nBorn in Pretoria, South Africa on 1 May 1917 to parents of Dutch origin and raised as a Roman Catholic.\nHe was educated at the University of Stellenbosch where he graduated BSc (Hons) Chemistry in 1937.

They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original panel featured Aryana Sayeed, Qais Ulfat, Nazir Khara, and Obaid Juenda; the panel for the second season features Ulfast, Juenda, Khara, and new coach Fereshta Samah.\n\nIn early 2015, Tolo TV announced that they had no plans for a third season.\n\nSelection process and format\nEach season begins with the \"Blind Auditions,\" where coaches form their team of artists (12) whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read \"I want you.\" At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around, or selects his or her coach if more than one coach expresses interest.\n\nIn the \"Battle Rounds,\" each coach pairs two of his or her team members to perform together, then their coach chooses the winner of the battle will advanced to the live shows and the loser will be eliminated.\n\nIn the final live performance phase of the competition, artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner. The coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week. As of season two, these artists would give a last chance performance to win their coach's save. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. In the first two seasons, one contestant from each team would advance to the final four.\n\nSeries overview\n\n  Team Qais\n  Team Aryana\n  Team Nazir\n  Team Obaid\n  Team Fereshta\n\nHistory\nThis is the state owned newspaper which broadcasts the national and international news on daily basis.\n\nSee also\n Afghan Star\n\nReferences\n\nAfghan television series\n\nAfghanistan\nMass media in Afghanistan\n2013 Afghan television series debuts", "machine_abstract": "The Voice of Afghanistan (Persian: آواز افغانستان‎, Pashto: افغانسانوێژی وچ‎) is the official radio station of Afghan Broadcasting Corporation and one of its main stations in Kabul city.

{"id": "Bears–Giants rivalry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bears%E2%80%93Giants%20rivalry", "title": "Bears–Giants rivalry", "text": "The Bears–Giants rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. The rivalry was notable for the six NFL championship games between the two teams prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, and the two subsequent Super Bowl-era playoff meetings that involved two of the NFL's greatest defensive units: the Bears' 46 defense crew helmed by Buddy Ryan, and the Giants' Big Blue Wrecking Crew mentored by Bill Belichick.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Super Bowl era\nThe Bears and Giants met in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL Championship or Super Bowl. Between 1933 and 1946, the Bears and/or the Giants appeared in 12 of 14 NFL championship games, and combined to win seven championships in that span. Their first meeting came in the first-ever NFL Championship Game that concluded the 1933 season. In a close-knit affair, the Bears won the game and the championship 23–21 by scoring the game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. It was Chicago's second consecutive championship, having previously won in 1932 when the league awarded the title to the team with the best regular season winning percentage. However, the Giants returned the favor in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, winning 30–13 by outscoring the Bears 27–0 in the fourth quarter. The game was forever immortalized as the Sneakers Game, as the Giants switched to basketball sneakers at the half due to the slick frozen conditions that affected the Polo Grounds field. \n\nThe Bears and Giants met for a third time in the 1941 NFL Championship Game. This game was notable as it happened two weeks following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; as a result, only 13,341 fans attended the game at Wrigley Field, the lowest of any NFL championship game. The Bears dominated the Giants 37–9 to win their fifth NFL title, thanks to four unanswered touchdowns in the second half. A fourth meeting took place in the 1946 NFL Championship Game, in which a then-record 58,346 fans witnessed the Bears defeat the Giants 24–14 in New York. The game was tied 14–14 after three quarters before the Bears scored ten unanswered points. The victory was marred, however, by a bribery scandal involving two Giants players.\n\nIn the 1956 NFL Championship Game, the Giants routed the Bears 47–7 at Yankee Stadium to win the championship. It was the team's last title until Super Bowl XXI in 1986. Similar to the 1934 title game, the Giants wore sneakers in order to gain traction on an icy field.  Seven years later, the Giants and Bears met for a sixth time to decide the 1963 NFL Championship. In a low-scoring affair, the Bears prevailed 14–10 to win their eighth NFL championship, their last until Super Bowl XX in 1985. It was also the final meeting between the Bears and Giants that decided the NFL championship.\n\nSuper Bowl era\nThe two teams underwent lengthy rebuilding periods following the 1963 title game, but in the 1980s, the Bears and Giants reemerged into title contention, thanks to two of the greatest defensive units in NFL history. Chicago's 46 defense, coached by Mike Ditka and defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, featured Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, and defensive ends Richard Dent and Dan Hampton. New York's Big Blue Wrecking Crew, on the other hand, were coached by Bill Parcells and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, and featured Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor, Carl Banks and Harry Carson. The two teams first squared off in the 1985 NFC Divisional Round, in which Chicago's defensive crew outplayed their Giant counterparts in a 21–0 shutout. The tone of the game was set when a punt attempt by Giants punter Sean Landeta was muffed in the strong winds and Shaun Gayle returned it five yards for a touchdown. The Bears went on to win the Super Bowl that season. A rematch then took place in the 1990 NFC Divisional Round, which also ended in a blowout. This time, however, the Giants dominated Chicago in a 31–3 rout, and went on to win Super Bowl XXV. To date, this was the most recent meeting in the playoffs between the Bears and the Giants.\n\nRecent years\nAfter the 1990 playoff meeting, the rivalry cooled off a bit, though games between the two teams remained highly competitive. However, there were some notable moments that took place since then. During Week 10 of the 2006 season, Bears returner Devin Hester returned a missed field goal a then-record 108 yards for a touchdown, culminating in the Bears' 38–20 victory. The win proved crucial for the Bears as they went on to finish with the NFC's best record at 13–3, en route to a Super Bowl XLI appearance. The Giants, on the other hand, turned a 6–2 start into a 2–6 finish, ending with an 8–8 record and losing in the Wild Card Round to the rival Philadelphia Eagles. Then in Week 4 of the 2010 season, the Giants defense sacked Bears quarterback Jay Cutler nine times in the first half en route to a 17–3 victory, dealing Chicago its first loss of the season.\n\nGame results \n\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| \n| style=\"| Bears  19–7\n| Polo Grounds\n| Bears  1–0\n| Giants' inaugural season.

A continuation of a journal founded in 1868 by the German physiologist, Eduard Friedrich Wilhelm Pflüger, Pflügers Archiv () is the oldest physiological journal. Pflügers Archiv is currently published by Springer, with 11 issues per year.\n\nThe journal publishes molecular and cellular studies across the physiological sciences; topics include the physiology of the heart, muscle and sensory systems, transport physiology, neuroscience, signalling, ion channels and receptors. It aims to publish \"innovative work that focuses on mechanistic insight into basic physiological functions\".\n\nHistory\nPflügers Archiv is the oldest physiological journal. It was founded in 1868 by the German physiologist, Eduard Friedrich Wilhelm Pflüger, under the title Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie des Menschen und der Tiere. It was published in German. The first issue of the journal contains 26 articles, with contributors including Hermann Rudolph Aubert, Julius Bernstein, Johann Nepomuk Czermak, Franciscus Donders, Sigmund Exner, Siegmund Mayer, Peter Ludvig Panum, William Thierry Preyer, Salomon Stricker, Hermann von Helmholtz, Friedrich Wilhelm Zahn and Nathan Zuntz. It includes the earliest accurate description of the action potential, by Julius Bernstein, using an apparatus called a \"differential rheotome\".\n\nThe journal was mainly published annually until 1874; there were two or three volumes annually in 1874–1890. From 1891, the volume was split into issues, with five or six issues per volume, and initially three volumes published a year; volumes often did not commence in January. The frequency of volumes increased, with five volumes in 1909.\n\nIn 1910, after Pflüger's death, the journal was retitled Pflüger's Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie des Menschen und der Tiere (). It was published by Springer in German, with some English translations of summaries. Several other German physiology journals merged into the publication: in 1919, Archiv für Anatomie und Physiologie. Physiologische Abt (), which had been founded in 1877; in 1921, Zentralblatt für Physiologie, which had been founded in 1887; and also Archiv für Physiologie. Publication was interrupted in 1945–46. The journal assumed its current title in 1968. It was published in a mixture of English, French and German until 1997, when it became an exclusively English-language journal.\n\nOther key developments published in the journal include Bernstein's explanation of the resting membrane potential; the demonstration of the requirement for sodium ions for nervous excitation, and the prediction of the existence of a lipid cell membrane by Ernest Overton; and early descriptions of conductance in excitable tissues by Ludwig Hermann. In 1978, Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann published the first description of the patch clamp technique in Pflügers Archiv.\n\nModern journal\nPflügers Archiv's 2009 impact factor is 3.158. It is also indexed in Academic OneFile, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts, Current Contents/Life Sciences, EBSCO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest and Scopus, among other services. All issues are available online as PDFs, with text versions additionally available from 2000; access is by subscription. Additionally, authors can pay to have their articles released freely online as part of a hybrid open access scheme.\n\n, the editor in chief is Bernd Nilius (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium).\n\nKey papers\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nSpringer Science+Business Media academic journals\nEnglish-language journals\nGerman-language journals\nHybrid open access journals\nPublications established in 1868\nPhysiology journals\nMonthly journals", "machine_abstract": "Pflügers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology is the official journal of The Federation of European Biophysical Societies (FEBS).

{"id": "Daycroft School", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daycroft%20School", "title": "Daycroft School", "text": "The Daycroft School was a co-educational private boarding school founded in 1928. Initially located at a private home in Darien, Connecticut, it relocated to Stamford in 1935, and in 1963, to the neighboring town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Relocating again in Greenwich, it eventually occupied the Rosemary Hall campus from 1971 until Daycroft's closing in 1991. Smart founded the school for the children of local Christian Scientists.\n\nSchool history \nDaycroft was founded by Sarah Pyle Smart as a private school for the children of area Christian Scientists so they could be educated in an environment akin to their home life, where the teachings of Christian Science were \"an integral part\" of life. To that end, the faculty were all members of The Mother Church. Admission to the school was restricted to the children of parents who were students of Christian Science. The school had no official tie with the Christian Science Church. In later years, admission was extended to those had a close relative who was a member of The Mother Church or one of its branch churches.\n\nThe school was a member of the Secondary Education Board and offered pre-school through high school, in general subjects and college preparatory education. The school offered partial scholarships and was incorporated in 1939 as a non-profit institution.\n\nThe school's initial home was in Darien, Connecticut, where the Smarts lived. In 1935, a portion of an estate was purchased on Noroton Hill, near the  Stamford Cove and became the new home for the school. The 46-acre Stamford campus was sold to Clairol in 1963, when the school moved to the Rock Ridge area of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1971, the school moved to the former Rosemary Hall campus, also in Rock Ridge. In 1998, the campus was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its architectural significance. Its chapel was designed in the Middle English Gothic style by Theodore E. Blake of Carrère & Hastings.\n\nPolio outbreak \nIn 1972, the Daycroft school was one of the last sites of a polio outbreak in the United States. Due to their Christian Science belief, very few students at the school were immunized for polio. The outbreak prompted an emergency quarantine and mass immunization, which successfully prevented polio from spreading to the rest of the state. Ultimately, at least 11 school children (9 boys and 2 girls) were stricken by the paralytic form of the disease.\n\nNotable alumni and staff \nRichard Bergenheim\nJacqueline Moss\nZack Snyder\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDaycroft School Foundation\nCS e-News Spotlight\n\nSchools in Fairfield County, Connecticut\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nChristian Science in the United States\nChristian Science in Connecticut\nFormer Christian Science churches, societies and buildings in the United States\nEducational institutions established in 1928\n1928 establishments in Connecticut", "machine_abstract": "Founded in 1660, Daycroft is one of the oldest schools in England and Wales.\nThe school was founded by John Croft as a free grammar school to educate poor boys from Bristol; it became known locally as \"The King's School at Daycroft\" or simply \"King's School\".

Administered by the City of London Academies Trust, it was opened in 2014. The college is coeducational and is affiliated with University College London  who is a strategic partner. It is rated “Outstanding” by Ofsted. It has an ALPS 1 score for value added.\n\nCurriculum \nThe NCS specialises in the teaching of Maths and the Sciences, and contains nine labs that are equipped to a high standard for studying the Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics). The centre offers the following A Level courses:\nBiology, Chemistry, Economics, English Literature, Further Maths, Geography, Government and Politics, History, Maths, Physics, Psychology and Religious Studies.  They also provide a super curriculum to extend knowledge beyond the A Level syllabus and introduce students to topics they might not otherwise be engaged with.\n\nCampus\nThe college is located in a Grade II listed former council building. Surrounding their buildings on the same campus is East Ham Leisure Centre and Library.\n\nSpecialist Support \nThe NCS provides specialist support in the sectors of Medicine, Law, Finance and Engineering.\n\nTechnology \nThe NCS is notable for a 1-1 deployment of Apple iPads for all students and staff. Outside of other benefits, the sixth form has credited this and some forward planning to allow live A Level lessons to continue on the very first day that schools were forced to close as part of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\n\nPartnerships and programmes\nWorking with Newham Council, the NCS is the academic A Level centre of a group of partner secondary schools in the borough. These schools are Cumberland, Kingsford, Lister, Little Ilford, Plashet, Rokeby, Royal Docks, Sarah Bonnell and Stratford School Academy.\n\nOn 12 November 2014 UCL announced a strategic partnership with Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. The partnership aligns with the aims of UCL 2034, reflecting UCL’s commitment to being a publicly engaged institution with an interest in the education of London students.\n\nGuest speakers have included Natalie Bennett, Owen Jones, Ed Miliband, Sir Win Bischoff, Gina Miller, Dr Aziz Aboobaker, Annabel Port, Stephen Timms MP, Dr Kenneth Tong, Dr George McGavin, , Simon Singh, Shami Chakrabarti, Lord Mervyn King, Robert Winston, Ed Miliband, Venki Ramakrishnan, Evan Davis and Sir Robin Wales.\n\nIvy League Success \nIn total NCS has secured its students 9 offers to Ivy League universities, five from the 2020 cohort alone. This includes the first student from the London Borough of Newham to attend MIT in Boston.\n\nExternal inspections\nNewham Collegiate was inspected by Ofsted in October 2021 and judged to be an Outstanding education provider in all areas. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman noted this was the first outstanding judgement reached since Ofsted returned to the full inspection framework after the temporary changes introduced during the covid pandemic. Writing to the school she said:“This is a tremendous achievement by you and your team. Not only does the inspection framework set a high bar for being judged outstanding, but you have achieved this in the context of all the disruption caused by COVID-19. I hope that you and your whole school community are very proud.”The report of Newham Collegiate said:“Learners at Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre benefit from studying in an environment dedicated to academic excellence.”\n\n\"Learners enjoy the challenge of meeting the high expectations set for them by their teachers. They benefit from their teachers’ high levels of subject expertise which allows them to learn, not only the content of their A-level syllabus, but also knowledge beyond that required for their examinations.”\n\n\"Learners benefit from leaders' expertise in preparing them to make successful applications to the most competitive universities and apprenticeship pathways.”\n\n“[Learners] enjoy attending additional sessions in which they have the opportunity to study undergraduate level content, and develop their skills in independent enquiry, critical thinking and debate. Consequently, learners are well-prepared for their future studies.”\n\n\"Learners appreciate the opportunity to engage with current issues and to develop their skills in proposing, debating and critical thinking.”\n\nReferences\n\n2014 establishments in England\nEducation in the London Borough of Newham\nEducational institutions established in 2014\nFree schools in London\nGrade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham", "machine_abstract": "The Newham Collegiate Sixth form centre is located in the London Borough of Newham, England and was opened on 1 September 2006 by Baroness Boothroyd.

The first Chinese character denotes which fleet the ship is service with, with East (Dong, 东) for East Sea Fleet, North (Bei, 北) for North Sea Fleet, and South (Nan, 南) for South Sea Fleet.

{"id": "Battle of Smolensk (1812)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Smolensk%20%281812%29", "title": "Battle of Smolensk (1812)", "text": "The Battle of Smolensk was the first major battle of the French invasion of Russia. It took place on 16–18 August 1812 and involved about 45,000 men of the Grande Armée under Emperor Napoleon I against about 30,000 Russian troops under General Barclay de Tolly. Napoleon occupied Smolensk by driving out Prince Pyotr Bagration's Second Army. The French artillery bombardment burned the city to the ground. Of 2,250 buildings, 84% were destroyed with only 350 surviving intact. Of the city's 15,000 inhabitants, about 1,000 were left at the end of the battle inside the smoking ruins. With over 15,000 casualties, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the invasion.\n\nPrelude\n\nVitebsk operation\nThe Russian First Western Army under General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly slipped away from Vitebsk on 27 July after an inconclusive fight against Emperor Napoleon, avoiding a general engagement. Napoleon was frustrated by his inability to bring the Russian army to battle and lingered at Vitebsk until 12 August to reform his Grande Armée and wait for stragglers to catch up. General Jean-Andoche Junot replaced King Jérôme as commander of the Westphalian VIII Corps and the Corps joined Napoleon's main army on 4 August near Orsha.\n\nFrench situation\nAfter five weeks of non-stop operations, the main 375,000-man strike force available to Napoleon had been reduced to 185,000 men by a host of factors. 90,000 troops under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot and Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, Jean Reynier and Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg had been detached for various missions. Russian forces had inflicted thousands of combat losses on Napoleon's main army, but the primary cause in the reduction of his force was strategic consumption—the need to garrison cities, towns, fortresses and forward supply depots.\n\nRapid forced marches and the inability of supply wagon trains led to high incidences of desertion and tens of thousands of losses to hunger and disease, most notably dysentery. The scorching July heat reduced the availability of water supplies. Huge numbers of cavalry horses and transportation horses and oxen had died due to a lack of grazing areas and the inability of the wagons to carry enough fodder.\n\nRussian plan\n\nThe loss of vast stretches of Russian territory to the advancing French led to a crisis and shift in power in the Russian high command. An aggressive \"Russian\" faction around Prince Pyotr Bagration called for an immediate, all-out attack against Napoleon. They were supported by Czar Alexander I and the bulk of the officer corps. The \"foreign\" faction around Barclay de Tolly, composed mostly of officers of German extraction, advocated the continuation of the present policy of delay and withdrawal to dilute Napoleon's striking power. Under strong pressure from above and below, including threats of force, Barclay agreed to an offensive on 6 August. Ignorant as to French dispositions, Barclay intended to outflank what he presumed to be the isolated corps of Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais near Rudnia, destroy it, and inflict further losses on the French as they came to Eugéne's aid.\n\nBarclay advanced on Rudnia and Poryeche on 7 August.Count Matvei Platov's Cossacks imposed a sharp defeat on General Horace Sébastiani's cavalry near Inkovo the same day, inflicting 600 French casualties. On 8 August, Barclay received false intelligence that Eugène's corps was at Poryeche and reoriented half of his army to face north. Platov was directed to rejoin Barclay's army and Bagration was to move to Vidra. Bagration disobeyed his orders, fearing French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's threat to his left flank. He declared his army was hungry and sick and moved to Smolensk. Barclay failed to stop him, merely adjusting his own forces to compensate. On 11 August, Barclay stayed put and engaged only in outpost fighting with French cavalry under Neapolitan King Joachim. On 12 August, Barclay's scouts found Poryeche empty and he directed Platov to reconnoiter the French movements. The Russian offensive had failed due to disagreements among the generals, Barclay's inactivity and pointless marches that lost the Russians time they could not recover.\n\nFrench plan\n\nNapoleon had expected a Russian offensive and saw in it a great opportunity to envelop and annihilate the Russian army. He directed Marshal Jacques MacDonald to cross the Daugava to help out Oudinot's force and ordered Oudinot and Saint-Cyr to attack Prince Peter Wittgenstein's 20,000-strong corps to prevent it from assisting Barclay. Napoleon came up with what became known as the Smolensk maneuver, a masterful operation designed to outflank Barclay from the south, cut off the Russians from Moscow and destroy the isolated Russian army, thus bringing the war to an end.\n\nThe action at Inkovo on 7 August was seen by Napoleon as heralding an immediate Russian attack. Worried, he deployed his army in a defensive posture around III Corps. By 10 August, Barclay's glacial slowness of operations had convinced Napoleon that the threat had passed. He proceeded with his maneuver. Vitebsk was garrisoned with a force of 3,800 men, which later grew to 7,000, to protect the French lines of communications. Napoleon did not know Barclay's exact location and was acting on instinct. The Grande Armée would advance in two huge columns commanded by Napoleon and Davout. Napoleon's column consisted of Joachim Murat's cavalry, the Imperial Guard, III Corps and IV Corps. It would cross the Dnieper at Rosasna. Davout's column would cross at Orsha, composed of I Corps, V Corps and VIII Corps. This giant force would advance east along the left bank of the Dnieper, swing north to cut the Smolensk-Moscow road and annihilate the isolated Russians. Latour-Maubourg's cavalry would attack down the Dnieper as a diversion. Napoleon's deployment remained hidden from the Russians due to a thick cavalry screen under Generals Emmanuel de Grouchy, Étienne de Nansouty and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. French engineers under General Jean Baptiste Eblé erected four pontoon bridges across the Dnieper near Rosasna on the night of 13–14 August and by daybreak the 175,000-strong Grande Armée was advancing rapidly toward Smolensk.\n\nBattle of Krasnoy\nBarclay had left Generalmajor Neverovski's 27th Division to guard Krasnoy, along with some cavalry and artillery. This force of 5,500–7,200 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 10–14 guns was attacked by 20,000 Frenchmen under Murat and Marshal Michel Ney beginning around 2:30 PM on 14 August. Murat's and Ney's inability to coordinate their infantry-cavalry operations allowed the Russians to get away, at the cost of 1,500–2,300 Russian men and seven guns as well as 500 French casualties. The French had multiple excellent chances to annihilate the Russians but failed to so.\nNeverovski retreated into Smolensk, shutting the gates behind him. The French inability to capture to the city on the fly imposed a disastrous delay on their operations. Neverovski requested reinforcements from Bagration and received Nikolai Raevsky's VII Corps, which arrived on the morning of 15 August to defend the southern bank of the Dnieper near Smolensk.\n\nBarclay learned of the French attack from Neverovski. He interpreted Napoleon's offensive as a retreat and prepared to capture Vitebsk. He ordered Bagration to move south along the Dnieper. Bagration refused, pointing out that Smolensk, Neverovski and Raevsky were in grave danger. He then received permission from Barclay to deploy to the Dnieper's southern bank at Katan. Barclay ordered General Dmitry Dokhturov's corps to join Bagration and directed the Smolensk governor to evacuate the city archives. No decisive action was undertaken by Barclay due to uncertainty about Napoleon's locations. Czar Alexander left the army and turned over command of the armies to Barclay, ordering him to defend Smolensk. Barclay decided to rush his and Bagration's men down the road from Vitebsk to Smolensk. With his entire plan of operations hanging in the balance, Napoleon failed to act with sufficient vigor and ordered a 24-hour halt to the advance instead.\n\nBattle\n\nSmolensk, a historic fortress city of 12,600 inhabitants on the main Western invasion route to Moscow, was defended by bastion towers and a thick stone wall. The River Dnieper ran through the middle. The Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk housed one of the most venerated icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Our Lady of Smolensk attributed to St Luke, and Napoleon assumed that the Russians would fight outside the city to avoid its destruction. By 16 August, French forces found the city heavily garrisoned by Bagration's troops, further reinforced with the subsequent arrival of Barclay and the main Russian army.\n\nThe main battle was fought on 16 August. An initial probing force captured two suburbs but failed to bring the Russians out to battle. Napoleon ordered a general assault with three corps of the Grande Armée, supported by two hundred artillery pieces. This was initially successful, the intense artillery bombardment setting the city on fire. French forces lacked ladders or climbing apparatus to scale the city walls and were under counter fire from Russian artillery. By nightfall, most of the city was burning.\n\nTo save the army, Barclay de Tolly abandoned the city destroying all ammunition stores and bridges leaving a small force to hold out for two days to cover his retreat. Around dawn on 17 August, Grande Armée Polish forces successfully breached the walls, and in a few hours the main French forces entered the city. Barclay retained forces on the other side of the river preventing a crossing until the night of August the 18th. The city was almost completely destroyed.\n\nCasualties\nBarclay de Tolly claimed 4,000 Russian casualties, while Bogdanovich spoke of 6,000 . Docturov's VI Corps had 16,800 men available prior to the battle but only 6,000 capable of combat at its end, which would mean 10,800 casualties for one Russian corps alone. Prince Eugen of Württemberg's division lost 1,300 men alone. Gaston Bodart gave 6,000. whilst David Chandler estimates them as 12,000–14,000. Alexander Mikaberidze suggests 10,000 Russian casualties at Smolensk.\n\nNapoleon claimed 700 French killed and 3,100–3,200 wounded. His estimate is disputed, as I Corps alone under Lobau lost 6,000. Chandler puts French losses at 10,000, while Mikaberidze also suggested 10,000. Bodart listed 10,000. Russian authors claimed the French losses were as high as 20,000.\n\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription \"SMOLENSK 17 VIII 1812\".\n\nSee also\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia\nBattle of Smolensk (1941)\nJean-Victor Poncelet\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConflicts in 1812\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles involving Russia\n1812 in the Russian Empire\nSmolensk\nAugust 1812 events\nBattles of the French invasion of Russia\nSmolensk Governorate\nBattles inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe", "machine_abstract": "The Battle of Smolensk was fought between the Russian Empire and Napoleon's Grande Armée in 1812, during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\nSmolensk had been captured by French forces under Marshal Ney on August 16–17 after fierce fighting against Russians defending it from within its walls as well as those attacking outside them.

{"id": "Hyacinthoides paivae", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthoides%20paivae", "title": "Hyacinthoides paivae", "text": "Hyacinthoides paivae is a species of bluebell in the genus Hyacinthoides native to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula. It lives chiefly in shady woodlands, and grows up to  tall, producing a cluster of up to 18 pale blue flowers in spring. It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H. italica.\n\nDescription\nHyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically  × . Each bulb produces 4–7 (more rarely 2–12) basal leaves, each  long and  wide. The stems are  long, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6–18 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicel  long, and is itself  long by  wide. H. paivae can be told apart from H. italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H. hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell-shaped flowers.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nHyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coruña, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Trás-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H. paivae genetically.\n\nH. paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo.\n\nTaxonomic history\nIn 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H. italica, which is only otherwise found near the French–Italian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodríguez-Oubiña in 1996, the specific epithet  honouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva.\n\nThe holotype, a specimen from Dumbría, A Coruña province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the ; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, the  and  in Madrid, the  in Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.\n\nOrtiz and Rodríguez-Oubiña initially placed the species in \"Hyacinthoides sect. Somera\", but more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis could not confirm any of the existing sections in the genus, and placed it instead in an informal group alongside H. non-scripta, H. hispanica and H. cedretorum.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\npaivae\nPlants described in 1996\nFlora of Spain\nFlora of Portugal\nEndemic flora of the Iberian Peninsula", "machine_abstract": "Herbarium specimens of Hyacinthoides paivaie collected in the 19th century are preserved at Kew Gardens, London and Herbier National de France (P), Paris.\nThe species is native to Europe where it grows on dry grasslands or rocky slopes from sea level up to 1800 m altitude.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Hyacinthoides paivae\".

It seeks to understand how drugs affect the human body as a single complex biological system. \nInstead of considering the effect of a drug to be the result of one specific drug-protein interaction, systems pharmacology considers the effect of a drug to be the outcome of the network of interactions a drug may have. In 1992, an article on systems medicine and pharmacology was published in China. Networks of interaction may include chemical-protein, protein–protein, genetic, signalling and physiological (at cellular, tissue, organ and whole body levels).

{"id": "AIP Records", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIP%20Records", "title": "AIP Records", "text": "AIP Records  is a record label that was started by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records in 1983 to continue the Pebbles series. AIP stands for \"Archive International Productions\". The first 10 volumes in the Pebbles series had been released by BFD Records of Kookaburra, Australia (most likely a fictitious label name to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits) in 1979–1980 and have been kept in print by AIP for many years. Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series – which concentrated on American regional music scenes – there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \"Original Punk Rock\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s – primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres – that were previously known only to a handful of collectors.\n\nTwo similar series of LPs featuring British music were released in the ensuing years, the English Freakbeat series and Electric Sugar Cube Flashbacks series. Although LPs are still available from the Bomp! Records website, none are being manufactured any longer; and many are now out of print, including all of the Freakbeat and Flashbacks discs.\n\nAIP Records also issued numerous CDs in the English Freakbeat series and Pebbles series, with the first 6 Pebbles volumes being basically the same as the LPs, with bonus tracks. The 6th Pebbles album was reissued more appropriately as the 6th CD in the English Freakbeat series, since this LP also featured British music. Most of the later Pebbles CDs were taken from particular regions, like the Highs series. In 2007, AIP Records released the Pebbles, Volume 11 CD as the last of the albums in this landmark series.\n\nAIP Records has begun the Essential Pebbles series, the Planetary Pebbles series, and the You Gotta Have Moxie series. With the exception of an album called New Fruit by Sky Saxon, former leader of the Seeds, all of the AIP releases are in one of these series.\n\nSee also\n List of record labels\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAIP Records mail order site\nAIP Records historical information\n\nRecord labels established in 1983\nAmerican independent record labels\nGarage rock record labels\nReissue record labels", "machine_abstract": "AIP records was founded in the early 1980s by musician and record producer Ian Poulter, who had previously worked as manager of The Clash's Mick Jones from 1977 to 1979.\nThe label released albums on vinyl only until 1988 when it began releasing CDs alongside its vinyl releases.

The Via Foundation supports community and philanthropy development in the Czech Republic. Via Foundation focuses on growing the number of people in the Czech Republic working collaboratively to improve their communities and giving to help others. “Every act of charity is a story – which can motivate other people who are thinking about giving back but don’t know how to start,” says Executive Director Jiří Bárta about why Via Foundation presents the Via Bona awards.\n\nThe Via Bona Awards are one of the two major annual awards in the Czech Republic to honor philanthropy and philanthropists.  The other major Czech philanthropy award is the TOP Corporate Philanthropists Award presented by Donors Forum to award companies which have given the highest total monetary amount to charitable causes over the course of one year.\n\nSince 1997, The Via Bona Awards are held each year under the auspices of the Embassy of the USA in Prague and the general partner is Nadace Vodafone Česká republika. The Via Bona Award is given to those who serve as an example to others through their material and financial support, as well as their willingness to tread untried paths.\n\nThe Via Bona Awards are nominated by Czech nonprofit organizations and are chosen by an independent jury.\n\nFor the 19th year in a row, Via Foundation recognized individuals and companies who help improve their communities by giving their time, energy, expertise or money to help others. Via announced the winners of the 2016 Via Bona Philanthropy Awards. Juries selected winners in six categories.\n\nThe 2016 award winners include people such as Zdeňka Mocňáková, who helps disabled people and senior citizens despite being bound to a wheelchair herself. She is the recipient of the Personal Engagement Award.\n\nIn the Young Personal Engagement category, the jury selected two winners: Jakub Trefný, who despite being just nineteen years old, is an experienced volunteer nad helps senior citizens, homeless people and refugees, and Milan Dzuriak, who undertakes “Journeys against Pain” to raise money to make disabled children’s dreams come true.\n\nThe Patron Award was presented to businessman Sanjiv Suri, owner of Zátiší Group, for his numerous philanthropic activities both in the Czech Republic and around the world. \n\nThe Good Company Award went to Dušan Hopp’s company Auto Díly Servis s.r.o., based in Nový Jičín, whose owner and employees helped remodel a Home for Pregnant Women in Crisis.\n\nThe Loyal Donor Award is a new category this year.

{"id": "Palestinian literature", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian%20literature", "title": "Palestinian literature", "text": "Palestinian literature refers to the Arabic language novels, short stories and poems produced by Palestinians. Forming part of the broader genre of Arabic literature, contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common.\n\nHistorical Origins\nPalestinian literature is one of numerous Arabic literatures, but its affiliation is national, rather than territorial. While Egyptian literature is that written in Egypt, Jordanian literature is that written in Jordan etc., and up until the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Palestinian literature was also territory-bound, since the 1948 Palestinian exodus it has become \"a literature written by Palestinians\" irrespective of their place of residence.\n\nOverview\n\nPalestinian Literature spoke to other causes of oppression and discrimination across the world. In his book, one of the foremost leaders of Palestinian literature and the person who coined the term Palestinian Resistance Literature, Ghassan Kanafani says, \"In my stories I give my characters the freedom to express their own positions without reservation\". This sense of international solidarity can also be found in Palestinian poets' work such as in Mahmoud Darwish's poem Cuban Chants, \"And the banner in Cuba.. The rebel raises it in the Aures.. Oh a nation that feels cold\", and in Samih Al-Qasim's poem, Birds Without Wings.\n\nIn the period between the 1948 Palestinian exodus and the 1967 Six-Day War, Palestinian Resistance Literature played a significant role in maintaining the Palestinian identity; forming a bridge between the two periods, which allowed the Palestinian identity to survive especially in the absence of armed resistance. In his book, Palestinian Resistance Literature Under Occupation, Ghassan Kanafani argues, \"Palestinian resistance literature, just like armed resistance, shapes a new circle in the historical series which practically has not been cut throughout the last half century in the Palestinian life”. \n \nSince 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three \"branches\" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.\n\nHannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside. She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in the Studies in the Humanities journal, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as \"writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine.\" However, Maurice Ebileeni argues that a fourth branch referring exclusively to anglophone literary works is not sufficient. Rather, Palestinian displacement both in Israel/Palestine and the diaspora have led to cultural and lingual diversification among Palestinians that exceeds experiences in Arabic- and English-speaking locations. Ebileeni suggest a polylingual branch that entails works by Palestinian authors - or authors of Palestinian descent - written in English as well as Italian, Spanish, Danish, Hebrew and several other languages.\n\nPalestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers like Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian \"collective identity\" and the \"just case\" of their struggle. There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have \"rebelled\" against the demand that their art be \"committed\". Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that \"poetry is not a civil servant, it's not a soldier, it's in nobody's employ.\" Rula Jebreal's novel Miral tells the story of Hind Husseini's effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Deir Yassin Massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nNovels and short stories\nSusan Abulhawas book Mornings in Jenin tells the story of a Palestinian family lost their homes during the 1948 war. In A Rift in Time author  Raja Shehadeh explored the relationship between the decline of the Ottoman Empire, British colonialism and Palestinian self-identity in a novel about his great-uncle Najib Nassar.\nShort stories in Palestinian literature started with writers like Samira Azam.\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry, using classic pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town.\n\nAfter the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel and after the passage of the Citizenship Law of 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad.\n\nThe work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon published an anthology of their work in 1966.\n\nThe work of Nathalie Handal  an award-winning poet, playwright, and writer appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines. She has been translated into twelve languages. She has promoted international literature through translation, research, and the edited The Poetry of Arab Women, an anthology that introduced several Arab women poets to a wider audience in the west.\n\nPalestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. In a poem about the Israeli bombing of Lebanon, published in the Palestinian literary magazine al-Karmel, Mahmoud Darwish wrote:\nSmoke rises from me, I reach out a hand to collect my limbs scattered from so many bodies, besieged from land and sky and sea and language. The last plane has taken off from Beirut airport and left me in front of the screen to watch\nwith millions of viewers\nthe rest of my death \nAs for my heart, I see it roll, like a pine cone, from Mount Lebanon, to Gaza.\n\nHakawati\nThe art of story telling was for a long time part of the cultural life in Arabic speaking countries of the Middle East. The tradition of “Tales From a Thousand and One Nights” is not an exception. In each small town or village of Palestine, itinerant story tellers called hakawati would visit and tell folk stories they knew, often in teahouses.

Gabel in the Chicago suburb of Darien, Illinois. He started the magazine at age 19 in 1995. The magazine was published on a bimonthly basis. The headquarters was in both Chicago and New York. Each issue followed a theme and consisted of feature-length interviews, essays and oral histories. With a focus on preservation, Stop Smiling published some of the last in-depth conversations with Kurt Vonnegut, Robert Altman, Lee Hazlewood and George Plimpton. The company ended the magazine in 2009 and became an independently owned imprint of Melville House Publishing.\n\nStop Smiling runs a storefront event space in Wicker Park, Chicago.

During the reign of the Shah kings, the Mulkajis (Chief Kajis) or Chautariyas served as prime ministers in a council of 4 Chautariyas, 4 Kajis, and sundry officers. These Bharadars (officers) were drawn from high caste and politically influential families such as the Pande, Basnyat, and Thapa families. The nobility of Gorkha was mainly based from Chetri families and they had a strong presence in civil administration affairs. All prime ministers of Nepal between 1768 and 1950 were Chhetris with the exception of Ranga Nath Poudyal, being a Khas Brahmin. Of the 23 men who have been elected since Nepal attained democracy from the Ranas in 1951, 15 have been Khas Brahmin, 3 Thakuri, 2 Newar Shresthas, 2 Chhetri, and 1 Sanyasi/Dasnami. The executive power allocation was fluctuating between Kajis and Chautariyas.\n\nIn 1804, a single authoritative position of Mukhtiyar was created by Rana Bahadur Shah which carried the executive powers of nation. Mukhtiyar held the position of head of the executive until the adoption of the title of Prime Minister in November 1843 by Mathabar Singh Thapa who became Mukhtiyar as well as Prime Minister and the Chief of the Nepalese Army. During the Rana dynasty, the position of prime minister was hereditary and the officeholder held additional titles — Maharaja of Lambjang and Kaski, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of Nepal and Grand Master of the Royal Orders of Nepal.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1951, non-aristocratic citizens like Matrika Prasad Koirala held the position of prime minister still under the authority of the King of Nepal. The first general election was held in 1959 and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala became the first elected prime minister of Nepal. However, he was deposed and imprisoned in the 1960 coup d'état by King Mahendra who went on to establish an oligarchic authoritative regime, the Panchayat system, and Nepal did not have a democratic government until 1990. After the Jana Andolan movement in 1990, the country became a constitutional monarchy. However, this was interrupted with the 2005 coup d'état by King Gyanendra. After the Loktantrik Andolan movement in 2006, the monarchy was abolished on 28 May 2008 by the 1st Constituent Assembly and the country was declared a federal parliamentary republic.

{"id": "Corbeil-Essonnes", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbeil-Essonnes", "title": "Corbeil-Essonnes", "text": "Corbeil-Essonnes () on the River Seine is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located  from the center of Paris.\n\nAlthough neighboring Évry is the official seat of the Arrondissement of Évry, the sub-prefecture building and administration are located inside the commune of Corbeil-Essonnes.\n\nHistory\nTraces of human presence in the area date to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages; later it was a Gallo-Roman settlement on the main road from Paris to Sens. The name Corbeil is derived from the Latin Corbulium, from the Gaulish cor beel, meaning \"holy house\". Since the time of Aymon, comte de Corbeil (died 957), to the 12th century it was the chief town of a powerful county, which passed to Mauger, son of Richard I of Normandy.\n\nWilliam de Corbeil (died 1136) became archbishop of Canterbury, but nothing is known for certain about his parentage. The Gothic church was built in the tenth century and rebuilt in the fifteenth century.  Before the expulsion of the Jews Corbeil had a flourishing Jewish community, which numbered thirteenth-century scholars Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil and  Perez ben Elijah. Peter of Corbeil (died 1222) was the teacher of Lotario de' Conti, who became pope as Innocent III.\n\nRepresentatives of the king of France signed two treaties of Corbeil in the town, the Treaty of Corbeil (1258) between France and Aragon and the Treaty of Corbeil (1326) between France and Scotland.\n\nCorbeil was besieged by the Duke of Burgundy in 1418.  The Protestants of France attacked it in 1562 amidst the religious war called the First Civil War. In 1590 General Alessandro Farnese, who had come to the assistance of the Catholics in France, fought at Corbeil.\n\nThe composer Camille Saint-Saëns lived in Corbeil for some years of his youth.\n\nThe commune of Corbeil-Essonnes was created on 10 August 1951 by the merger of the commune of Corbeil with the commune of Essonnes. The commune town hall (mairie) is located in Corbeil.\n\nInhabitants of Corbeil-Essonnes are known as Corbeil-Essonnois.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe population data given in the table and graph below for 1946 and earlier refer to the former commune of Corbeil.\n\nEconomy\n\nIn the 19th century, Corbeil-Essonnes was a centre of the flour-milling industry. Essonnes also had notable papermills.\n\nToday, X-Fab France SAS is headquartered here and operates a semiconductor fabrication plant. The  site includes 25000 square meters of cleanrooms and a design center. The fab had been founded by IBM in 1964. In 1999 it was transferred into a joint venture between IBM and Infineon, operating under the name Altis Semiconductor(fr). In 2010 it was sold to Yazid Sabeg for one symbolic Euro. X-Fab acquired the assets of insolvent Altis in 2016.\n\nSafran Aircraft Engines has a plant in Corbeil.\n\nTransport\nCorbeil-Essonnes is served by Corbeil-Essonnes station which is an interchange station on Paris RER line D. Corbeil-Essonnes is also served by Essonnes-Robinson station and by Moulin-Galant station on Paris RER line D.\n\nThe town is crossed by the EuroVelo 3 track.\n\nEducation\nThere are about 40 schools in Corbeil-Essonnes.\n\nJunior high schools:\n Collège Chantemerle\n Collège La Nacelle\n Collège Louise Michel\n Collège Saint-Spire\n Collège Sédar Senghor\n\nSenior high schools/Sixth-form colleges:\n Lycée Robert Doisneau\n Lycée polyvalent Saint Léon\n\nNotable people\nNigel Atangana, footballer\nJean-Sylvain Babin, footballer\nDylan Bahamboula, footballer\nDemba Diagouraga, footballer \nClaude Dauphin, actor\nDamien Mozika, footballer \nFélicien Rops (1833-1898) Belgian artist and illustrator \nHadi Sacko, footballer\nPNL, French rappers\nMMZ, French rappers\nWilliam de Corbeil, medieval Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nTwin towns\n Alzira, Spain, since 1991\n Belinho e Mar (Esposende), Portugal, since 2000\n Bishopbriggs, Scotland, since 1989\n Sindelfingen, Germany, since 1961\n\nSee also\nCommunes of the Essonne department\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website \n website MJC of Corbeil-Essonnes \n\nLand use (IAURIF) \nMayors of Essonne Association \n\nCommunes of Essonne", "machine_abstract": "Corbeil-Essonnes is a commune in the Essonne department of France, located on the Seine river near Paris and Évry.\nThe town was founded by the Romans as Corbieulum (\"Corbieul\"); it became known to English speakers during its occupation from 1560 until 1661 when King Charles II granted permission for the construction there of a new royal palace after his escape from England following defeat at Worcester.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Corbeil-Essonnes\".

{"id": "First Dates", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Dates", "title": "First Dates", "text": "First Dates is a British reality television programme that has aired on Channel 4 since 20 June 2013. The programme has been narrated by Brian Protheroe since 2015.\n\nProduction\nThe programme was filmed at the Paternoster Chop House restaurant in Paternoster Square, Central London from 2013 to 2020, showing many people on dates, all of whom have not met each other before. At the end of the date, the couples are interviewed together and asked whether they would like to see each other again. The restaurant is closed to the public while filming takes place. The restaurant is fitted with 42 \"Pan–tilt–zoom\" cameras and there are at least 70 crew members on set during filming, which lasts 15 hours a day. Each diner is given £25 towards the cost of their meal.\n\nThe spin-off show, First Dates Hotel, follows the same TV format with contestants meeting for the first time in a hotel restaurant, but if the date goes well, the couples are offered the opportunity to check-in for the night. The first series was filmed at Le Vieux Castillon in Castillon-du-Gard[2] offering idyllic settings with a variety of activities for the successful second daters, and added sommelier Xavier Chapelou to Fred Sirieix's team. The second series was filmed at Aquapetra Resort & Spa in Campania near Naples, Italy.\n\nIn 2020 it was announced that filming would move to Manchester for Series 16. The specific location was later confirmed in January 2021, when it was announced that the sixteenth series would begin airing on 19 January 2021, in the new location of The Refinery, located in Spinningfields, in Manchester.\n\nAnother spin-off show, Teen First Dates began airing on E4 on 22 February 2021 and consisted of 6 episodes. Each episode was also available to stream on All 4. Following the same format as the parent show and also taking place at Spinningfields, it follows 16-19 year olds as they begin dating for the first time.\n\nRestaurant staff\nSince series 3 (2015) the restaurant's maître d'hôtel Fred Sirieix offers pieces to camera on the nature of love, romance and dating. When not filming for First Dates, he was the general manager at restaurant Galvin at Windows, although he left in December 2019 after 14 years.\n\nThe waiting staff and barman do not work in the restaurant full-time, but are recruited for when the series is being filmed.\nCiCi Coleman is an actor who trained at New York Film Academy, whilst barman Merlin Griffiths is a pub landlord who has previously worked as a global brand ambassador for Bombay Sapphire gin. Griffiths also works alongside co-bartender Fiona Beck who alongside working in the First Dates restaurant, has a career in advertising, and has also worked as a model in the past and has featured in fashion shows in Paris, Barcelona and New York. The waiting staff are joined by Grant Urquhart, David Marc and Daniella Kalita.\n\nTransmissions\n\nRegular\n\nSpecials\n\nCelebrity First Dates\n\nTeen First Dates\n\nFirst Dates Hotel\n\nCelebrity First Dates Hotel\n\nBest Bits\n\nInternational versions\nThe format created in the United Kingdom has been adapted in Belgium, Finland, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Australia, Spain, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, Poland, USA, France, Brazil, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Argentina, Portugal, Austria and South Africa.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2013 British television series debuts\n2010s British reality television series\n2020s British reality television series\nBritish dating and relationship reality television series\nChannel 4 reality television shows\nEnglish-language television shows\nTelevision series by Warner Bros.

The ouvrage consists of one and two infantry blocks at an altitude of . Gordolon was built by Borie contractors at a cost of 21.4 million francs.  Work started in November 1931 and was completed in April 1934.\n\nDescription \nOuvrage Gordolon was planned to control the road through Roquebilliėre in coordination with Ouvrage Flaut. Both ouvrages are unusual for the Alps in having anti-tank guns, which were more commonly used in main Maginot Line in the more favorable tank country of northeastern France. The compact plan was laid out on two levels, with a planned expansion of the barracks never carried out.\nBlock 1 (entry): one machine gun cloche and one machine gun embrasure. \nBlock 2 (infantry): one machine gun cloche, one twin heavy machine gun cloche, one grenade launcher cloche, one machine gun/47mm anti-tank gun embrasure and two 81mm mortar embrasures.\nBlock 3 (infantry): one machine gun cloche, two twin heavy machine gun cloches, one observation cloche, two 75mm gun embrasures and two 81mm mortar embrasures.\n\nA fourth block was planned as a casemate with two heavy machine gun embrasures, but not built. Two observation posts included the post at Pas d'Albéras.\n\nSee also \n List of Alpine Line ouvrages\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \nAllcorn, William. The Maginot Line 1928-45.

{"id": "Earth's rotation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s%20rotation", "title": "Earth's rotation", "text": "Earth's rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris, Earth turns counterclockwise.\n\nThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.\n\nEarth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend; the length of a day increased about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE. Scientists reported that in 2020 Earth has started spinning faster, after consistently spinning slower than 86,400 seconds per day in the decades before. Because of that, engineers worldwide are discussing a 'negative leap second' and other possible timekeeping measures.\n\nHistory\nAmong the ancient Greeks, several of the Pythagorean school believed in the rotation of Earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.\n\nA more conventional picture was supported by Hicetas, Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that Earth rotated but did not suggest that Earth revolved about the Sun. In the third century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos suggested the Sun's central place.\n\nHowever, Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about Earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought Earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.\n\nIn 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata suggested that the spherical Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of Earth. He provided the following analogy: \"Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward.\"\n\nIn the 10th century, some Muslim astronomers accepted that Earth rotates around its axis. According to al-Biruni, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020) invented an astrolabe called al-zūraqī based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries \"that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.\" The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: \"According to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandisīn), the Earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the Earth and not the stars.\" Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it. At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.\n\nIn medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view and so, reluctantly, did John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of Earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of Earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central Sun.\n\nTycho Brahe, who produced accurate observations on which Kepler based his laws of planetary motion, used Copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary Earth. In 1600, William Gilbert strongly supported Earth's rotation in his treatise on Earth's magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries. Those like Gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of Earth about the Sun are called \"semi-Copernicans\". A century after Copernicus, Riccioli disputed the model of a rotating Earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies; such deflections would later be called the Coriolis effect. However, the contributions of Kepler, Galileo and Newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of Earth.\n\nEmpirical tests\nEarth's rotation implies that the Equator bulges and the geographical poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the pendulum measurements taken by Richer in 1673 as corroboration of the change in gravity, but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the oblateness of Earth, thus confirming the positions of both Newton and Copernicus.\n\nIn Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the Northern Hemisphere (and left in the Southern) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of cyclone rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and clockwise, respectively).\n\nHooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of , but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in Bologna, Johann Friedrich Benzenberg in Hamburg and Ferdinand Reich in Freiberg, using taller towers and carefully released weights. A ball dropped from a height of 158.5 m departed by 27.4 mm from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1 mm.\n\nThe most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Léon Foucault in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended  from the top of the Panthéon in Paris. Because of Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about  clockwise per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world.\n\nPeriods\n\nTrue solar day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun (solar noon to solar noon) is its true solar day or apparent solar day. It depends on Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two. The true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the Sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual, taking about  longer to do so. Conversely, it is about  shorter near aphelion. It is about  longer near a solstice when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about . Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near  by  solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near  when it is only  longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near  and  by  and , respectively.\n\nMean solar day\n\nThe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day, which contains . Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than . Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.\n\nThe apparent solar time is a measure of Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.\n\nStellar and sidereal day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the International Celestial Reference Frame, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is  seconds of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing mean vernal equinox, named sidereal day, is  of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about .\n\nBoth the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about  . This is a result of the Earth turning 1 additional rotation, relative to the celestial reference frame, as it orbits the Sun (so 366.25 rotations/y). The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods  and .\n\nRecently (1999–2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of  has varied between  and , which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see Fluctuations in the length of day).\n\nAngular speed\n\nThe angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is  ± . Multiplying by (180°/π radians) × (86,400 seconds/day) yields , indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun. Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of  (WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of . Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or . This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by . However, the use of the solar day is incorrect; it must be the sidereal day, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, , which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km/h.\n\nThe tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude. For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at latitude 28.59° N, which yields a speed of: cos(28.59°) × 1674.4 km/h = 1470.2 km/h. Latitude is a placement consideration for spaceports.\n\nThe peak of the Cayambe volcano is the point of Earth's surface farthest from its axis; thus, it rotates the fastest as Earth spins.\n\nChanges\n\nIn rotational axis \n\nEarth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and nutation. It also moves with respect to Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.\n\nPrecession is a rotation of Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the Chandler wobble.\n\nIn rotational speed\n\nTidal interactions \nOver millions of years, Earth's rotation has been slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the Moon. Thus angular momentum is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to , where  is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process has gradually increased the length of the day to its current value, and resulted in the Moon being tidally locked with Earth.\n\nThis gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented by estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites; a compilation of these measurements found that the length of the day has increased steadily from about 21 hours at 600 Myr ago to the current 24-hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.\n\nResonant stabilization \n\nThe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600 Myr ago. Some models suggest that Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the Precambrian. This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600 Myr ago; the simulated results agree quite closely with existing paleorotational data.\n\nGlobal events \n\nSome recent large-scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by reducing Earth's moment of inertia. Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is also changing the distribution of Earth's mass, thus affecting the moment of inertia of Earth and, by the conservation of angular momentum, Earth's rotation period.\n\nThe length of the day can also be influenced by manmade structures. For example, NASA scientists calculated that the water stored in the Three Gorges Dam has increased the length of Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds due to the shift in mass.\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe primary monitoring of Earth's rotation is performed by very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the Global Positioning System, satellite laser ranging, and other satellite geodesy techniques. This provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time, precession, and nutation.\nThe absolute value of Earth rotation including UT1 and nutation can be determined using space geodetic observations, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry and Lunar laser ranging, whereas their derivatives, denoted as Length-of-day excess and nutation rates can be derived from satellite observations, such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Satellite laser ranging to geodetic satellites.\n\nAncient observations\nThere are recorded observations of solar and lunar eclipses by Babylonian and Chinese astronomers beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from the medieval Islamic world  and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning Earth was turning faster throughout the past.\n\nCyclic variability \nAround every 25–30 years Earth's rotation slows temporarily by a few milliseconds per day, usually lasting around 5 years. 2017 was the fourth consecutive year that Earth's rotation has slowed. The cause of this variability has not yet been determined.\n\nOrigin \n\nEarth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust, rocks, and gas that coalesced to form the Solar System. This primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas. As this interstellar dust is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.\n\nHowever, if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the Theia impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact. Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.\n\nSee also \n\n Allais effect\n Diurnal cycle\n Earth's orbit\n Earth orientation parameters\n Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n Geodesic (in mathematics)\n Geodesics in general relativity\n Geodesy\n History of Earth\n History of geodesy\n Inner core super-rotation\n List of important publications in geology\n Nychthemeron\n Spherical Earth\n World Geodetic System\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nUSNO Earth Orientation new site, being populated\nUSNO IERS old site, to be abandoned\nIERS Earth Orientation Center: Earth rotation data and interactive analysis\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\nIf the Earth's rotation period is less than 24 hours, why don't our clocks fall out of sync with the Sun?\n\nDynamics of the Solar System\nRotation\nRotation", "machine_abstract": "The Earth's rotation is the process by which it rotates on its axis, and orbits around the Sun in 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 10 seconds (365.26 days).

{"id": "Nefopam", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefopam", "title": "Nefopam", "text": "Nefopam, sold under the brand name Acupan among others, is a centrally acting, non-opioid painkilling medication, that is primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain.\n\nNefopam acts in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain via novel mechanisms: antinociceptive effects from triple monoamine reuptake inhibition, and antihyperalgesic activity through modulation of glutamatergic transmission.\n\nMedical uses\nNefopam is effective for prevention of shivering during surgery or recovery from surgery. Nefopam was significantly more effective than aspirin as an analgesic in one clinical trial, although with a greater incidence of side effects such as sweating, dizziness and nausea, especially at higher doses. The estimated relative potency of nefopam to morphine indicates that 20 mg of nefopam HCl is the approximate analgesic equal of 12 mg of morphine with comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, or oxycodone, while nefopam tends to produce fewer side effects, does not produce respiratory depression, and has much less abuse potential, and so is useful either as an alternative to opioid analgesics, or as an adjunctive treatment for use alongside opioids or other types of analgesics. Nefopam is also used to treat severe hiccups.\n\nContraindications\nNefopam is contraindicated in people with convulsive disorders, those that have received treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine or isocarboxazid within the past 30 days and those with myocardial infarction pain, mostly due to a lack of safety data in these conditions.\n\nSide effects\nCommon side effects include nausea, nervousness, dry mouth, light-headedness and urinary retention. Less common side effects include vomiting, blurred vision, drowsiness, sweating, insomnia, headache, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, aggravation of angina and rarely a temporary and benign pink discolouration of the skin or erythema multiforme.\n\nOverdose\nOverdose and death have been reported with nefopam. Overdose usually manifests with convulsions, hallucinations, tachycardia, and hyperdynamic circulation. Treatment is usually supportive, managing cardiovascular complications with beta blockers and limiting absorption with activated charcoal.\n\nInteractions \n\nIt has additive anticholinergic and sympathomimetic effects with other agents with these properties. Its use should be avoided in people receiving some types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) as there is the potential for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crises to result.\n\nPharmacology\n\nThe mechanism of action of nefopam and its analgesic effects are not well understood, although inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopamine (that is, acting as an ) is thought to be involved. It also reduces glutamate signaling via modulating sodium and calcium channels.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nThe absolute bioavailability of nefopam is low. It is reported to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations between 49 and 183 nM. The drug is approximately 73% protein-bound across a plasma range of 7 to 226 ng/mL (28–892 nM). The metabolism of nefopam is hepatic, by N-demethylation and via other routes. Its terminal half-life is 3 to 8 hours, while that of its active metabolite, desmethylnefopam, is 10 to 15 hours. It is eliminated mostly in urine, and to a lesser extent in feces.\n\nChemistry\nNefopam is a cyclized analogue of orphenadrine, diphenhydramine, and tofenacin, with each of these compounds different from one another only by the presence of one or two carbons. The ring system of nefopam is a benzoxazocine system.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nRecreational use\nRecreational use of nefopam has rarely been reported, and is far less common than with opioid analgesics.\n\nNames\nIn the 1960s, when it was first developed, it had the generic name fenazoxine.\n\nSee also \n Troparil\n\nReferences \n\nAnalgesics\nDrugs with unknown mechanisms of action\nMuscarinic antagonists\nNitrogen heterocycles\nOxygen heterocycles\nSodium channel blockers", "machine_abstract": "Nefopam is used to treat moderate pain and reduce fever.\nIt works by blocking the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which increases their levels at nerve endings and reduces pain transmission from nerves to the spinal cord.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Nefopam\".

{"id": "Balmorhea State Park", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmorhea%20State%20Park", "title": "Balmorhea State Park", "text": "Balmorhea State Park is a  state park located on the San Solomon Springs in Reeves County, Texas, opened in 1968. The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year-round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day.\n\nFeatures\nThe main feature of the park is the ,  freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world’s largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to  a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from  and up to  deep.  The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving.\n\nHistory\nThe Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system.\n\nThe Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.\n\nIn early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery. Apache Corporation also established a one million dollar endowment fund for the park.\n\nThe pool reopened March 1, 2019 after repairs to the pool were completed. Only day-use facilities were available while the renovation of San Solomon Courts and campgrounds were still under way.\n\nTexas Parks and Wildlife Department shut the park again on September 3, 2019 to repair the park's failing septic system and again in January 2021 for further repairs \"for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe park partially reopened in June of 2021 with the swimming area reopening.\n\nSee also\n List of Texas state parks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Home movie of the Cummings Family Scuba Diving at Balmorhea State Park in 1964\n Balmorhea State Park, Texas Parks and Wildlife\n\nProtected areas of Reeves County, Texas\nState parks of Texas\nSwimming venues in Texas\nCivilian Conservation Corps in Texas", "machine_abstract": "Balmorhea State Park is located in the Balmorhea Mountains of northwestern New Mexico, United States.

{"id": "Cristina Bautista Taquinas", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina%20Bautista%20Taquinas", "title": "Cristina Bautista Taquinas", "text": "Cristina Bautista Taquinas (1977–2019) was a Colombian activist, community leader of the Paez/Nasa people of Colombia, and social worker. She dedicated her life to defending indigenous peoples' lands, and fighting for indigenous women's rights.\n\nEarly life \nCristina Bautista Taquinas was born in 1977 la vereda La Capilla in Corinto, a small town in Colombia’s Cauca department. She was the oldest of five siblings, and her childhood consisted of taking care of her younger siblings from the time she was six years old. While her parents worked to financially support her family, as a child she would take her siblings to daycare before school, cook, and do the laundry for her family.\n\nAt age twelve, she left home to support her family financially and worked in various homes and fincas, cooking for the finca workers and doing their laundry.\n\nAt age thirteen, she went to work in the big city nearest her hometown, Cali. The woman she worked for in Cali encouraged her to attend high school there. She had never finished her elementary education since she begun working at a young age, but nevertheless she was accepted into a high school in Cali due to her good performance on an entrance exam, and she eventually graduated from high school in Cali.\n\nEducation \nShe stayed in Cali and attended Universidad del Valle, first studying occupational therapy. She rented a small room and put herself through college by being a vendor in one of Cali’s soccer stadiums. She would sell orange juice made of oranges that her family would send her from their reservation of Tacueyo back home, and would also sell \"cholado\", a traditional treat from Cali.\n\nShe was a good student, but underwent some financial hardship when another vendor caused conflict, which resulted in her losing her vendor spot and income. Due to this, her grades suffered, and her family encouraged her to drop out of college and come home. But, she never gave up, and through financial struggles, she continued her schooling.\n\nAfter a few semesters, she changed her focus of study to social work. As soon as she started in this new field, she absolutely loved every aspect of it. She loved studying community work, intervention against violence of women and children, social justice, human rights, and equality. She was passionate about these subjects as they related to her own Paez/Nasa community’s struggles of marginalization, and violence against indigenous women and people at large by the Colombian armed conflict that plagued her land by guerilla groups such as the FARC who often kidnapped and murdered people of her community.\n\nIn 2017, she was granted a scholarship in the Human Rights Training Program for Indigenous Peoples of Latin America.\n\nIn 2018, she graduated with her degree in Social Work from the School of Social Work and Human Development of Universidad del Valle.\n\nActivism \nAfter her graduation in 2018, she returned home to the Paez/Nasa Tacueyo reservation in Toribio, Cauca and wanted to apply her social work studies in her community.\n\nHer activism focused on violence against women, not only on her reservation but in her town and department at large, and united peers, friends, and any indigenous woman who wanted to participate to share their experiences.\n\nShe dreamed of women holding positions of leadership in the Paez/Nasa community, and wanted to fight for women’s rights and equality. She wanted Toribio to not only be the start of the women’s movement in Cauca, but in Colombia as a whole, and beyond.\n\nHilando Pensamiento \nShe started her own movement, ”Hilando Pensamiento”, or “Weaving Thoughts”, in order to empower and encourage indigenous women. Her movement was focused on empowering women to dream, and her message was that indigenous women had the right to develop and grow and be in charge of making important decisions. She believed in equal pay in order to truly value a woman's work, who she believed worked double shifts, one during the day and then one at home caring for the family.\n\nThe women involved in the “Hilando Pensamiento” group were treated poorly in the community, particularly by the traditional male leaders who labeled them as subversive and disliked that women were forming a group, questioning the social norms and customs that had always been in place. While the group started off being disorganized, not having set meeting locations, they traveled El Valle telling all women about their capacity for autonomy and growth. Even though men and even some women rejected her ideas, with her open mind and grand vision, Cristina always believed in her cause in order to empower women, as well as to educate the new, forward thinking generations.\n\nThe \"Hilando Pensamiento\" Movement got accredited by the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2019.\n\nLeadership \nWith her women empowerment movement, Cristina longed to become part of the Constituyente Nasa, the constituent assembly responsible for developing the constitution of the Paez/Nasa people. Her goal was to gain her own spot on the assembly to represent women with her movement and help make decisions in the community. She was rejected many times and was humiliated, but she continued attending assembly meetings until she gained a seat of her own in the assembly as an editor.\n\nHer position on the Nasa Constituent Assembly made her very notable in her community, as people wanted her to run for governor. She intended to continue her studies to earn her Master’s,  but eventually accepted a position as Nasa governor.\n\nAs a social worker, founder of an accredited women’s movement, having a seat on her community’s constituent assembly and governor of the Paez/Nasa community, in early 2019 she traveled to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues headquarters in New York to represent indigenous women. Her talk in this forum called attention to the hardships and violence indigenous peoples in Colombia were facing at the hands of FARC guerilla groups, as well as the inequalities and struggles women faced. At this event, she was internationally recognized as a representative of indigenous peoples.\n\nDeath \nAs sovereign people, the Paez/Nasa have their own police-like Native Guard made up of volunteers that defend and protect their territories. Following tradition, they are unarmed as they carry traditional wooden sticks adorned with ribbons.\n\nIn August 2019, two Paez/Nasa Native Guards were killed. In response to this murder of her people as well as the murder of many others, Cristina spoke out against the violence that has plagued her community for years.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, some Paez/Nasa Native Guards were patrolling an area of the reservation, Vereda La Luz, when they were alerted to the presence of an unknown vehicle carrying kidnapped individuals. The guards blocked the vehicle on the road and called for backup. Four more guards, Cristina, and another female Nasa governor answered their plea for help, and when they arrived, started to help free the kidnapped people trapped in the vehicle. Yet, this incident proved to be an attack by the FARC guerilla, as the hidden attackers then rained gunfire and grenades on the helpers, killing Cristina as well as four Native Guards, and injuring five more.\n\nLegacy \nDespite Cristina's death, her \"Hilando Pensamientos\" movement is still active, posting on their social media pages and organizing events. Her community still fights for peace in their land, and equality for all. Her death brought international attention to the Paez/Nasa’s cause, and has received attention and help from the Colombian government as well.\n\nA mural in Cristina’s honor was added to Universidad del Valle where she graduated from.\n\nReferences \n\n1977 births\n2019 deaths\nColombian women activists\nUniversity of Valle alumni", "machine_abstract": "Bautista is the daughter of former Guam Governor and current U.S. Senator Frank \"Bobby\" J. \"Doctor Bobbie\" S.

It is much and deservedly admired for the singular beauty of its situation. The wood, which grows close down to the sea-shore, is a noble object from the house, and presents an agreeable retreat from the heat of summer.\n\nHistory\nIt stands on the site of a house which was formerly occupied by a notorious smuggler named Boyce (d. 1740), who for a long series of years had been engaged in the illicit trade in the \"back of the island,\" but having sufficiently increased his savings, he purchased Appley, and retired there, seemingly far removed from his former connections and avocations.  Boyce even aspired to a seat in the legislature, smuggling not then being looked upon as a very heinous offence. It is located near Appley Towers, the seat of the William Hutt family who bought it in the 1870s. Appley was for many years the mansion house of the Hutt family. One of the proprietors of this estate was Governor of the Colony of Western Australia. The gallant Captain John Hutt, who so greatly distinguished himself, and fell in command of the Queen, in Lord Howe's glorious victory, on 1 June 1794, was also of this family.

He served as the second Roman Catholic Bishop of Portsmouth from 1900 to 1910.\n\nLife\nBorn in London on 2 September 1841, he was a student at St. Edmund's College, Ware between 1855 and 1863. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Southwark on 4 October 1864. Cahill had been Rector of Ryde since 1868, and vicar-general of the diocese since its foundation.\n\nHe was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Portsmouth and Titular Bishop of Thagora on 21 March 1900. His consecration to the Episcopate took place on 1 May 1900, the principal consecrator was Francis Bourne, Bishop of Southwark (later Archbishop of Westminster), and the principal co-consecrators were John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport and Menevia and Charles Maurice Graham, Coadjutor Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions. It was thus that the diocese was enriched by the presence of such congregations as the Benedictines of Solesmes, both monks and nuns. Five Abbeys (Douai, Quarr, Farnborough, Ryde, and East Cowes) were founded in the diocese.\n\nBishop Cahill died at Portsmouth on 2 August 1910, aged 68.\n\nReferences \n\n1841 births\n1910 deaths\nRoman Catholic clergy from London\nRoman Catholic bishops of Portsmouth\n20th-century Roman Catholic bishops in England", "machine_abstract": "Bishop John Cahill, CSC is the Bishop of Dromore in Northern Ireland and Archdiocese of Armagh & Emly.\nHe was born on 16 May 1957 at Lisburn Cathedral to parents Michael and Margaret Cahill who were married there as well.

This Theyyam is deified by Mavilan, Koppalan and Vannan communities and is done with the cooperation of Hindus and Muslims. The characters of this theyyam are mostly spirits of Mappilas that are related to the local deities. The common names of male Mappila theyyams are Aali, Aandi, Mukri, Poker, Bappiriyan, Kunhali, Mammu, Mammad etc. Ummachi and Naithiyar are the common names attributed to female theyyams.The dialogues of Mappila theyyams have mentions about Islamic migration to Kerala in the 7th century and communal harmony.\n\nLegend \nThe origins of the legend of Mappila Theyyam traces to the kuladevata temple of Kamballur Kottayil Tharavad in Chittarikkal, Kasaragod district. The main deity of the temple is Karinchamundi however, as per folklore the spirit of an mukri of nearby Pulingome Mosque named Kalanthan who died under mysterious circumstances in nearby river is also merged with the main deity. In the annual theyyam proceedings of this temple Kalanthan mukri is represented as Mappila Theyyam along with the Chamundi theyyam. The mappila theyyam starts the divine act by offering banku (prayer call) and offering namaz. It has less ornamentation, facial drawings and captive head gears than Chamundi theyyakolam. This art form represents the syncretism of Mappila Muslims and harmony between Muslims and Hindus that existed in the region since olden times. The ritual traditions of Pulingome Mosque also has similar harmonious elements. The annual Makham Uroos conducted in the mosque begins with cooperation of seniors of Kamballur Kottayil Tharavadu.\n\nOther Mappila Theyyam \nThere are almost fifteen Mappila Theyyams that are practiced across areas that were under Kolathunadu in Kasaragod district and parts of Kannur district. . The most famous among them besides Kamballur Kottayil Chamundi theyyam are,\n\n Aalitheyyam practiced in Kumbla performed by members of Vannan caste is linked with the legend of Naduvilan tharavad, Arikady.\n Bappiriyan Theyyam practiced in Kannur district, Manjeshwar etc. It has decorated head gear.\n Koyi Mammad Theyyam at Mouveni Sree Devi Kovilakam in Narkkilakad, Chittarikkal.\n Naithiyar Theyyam of Ettikulam, Ramanthali\n Ummachi Theyyam practiced in areas of Allada Swaroopam.\n Beevi Theyyam  at Pappinisseri\n\nSee also\nTemples of Kerala\nUttama Villain\nPadayani\nNeeliyar Bhagavathi\nThirayattam\nThiyyar history\n Islam in Kerala\n Theyyam\n\nReferences \n\n \nDances of Kerala\nRitual dances\nArts of Kerala", "machine_abstract": "Mappilapattu (Malayalam: മേളപ്പദങ്ങൾ) is the traditional music of Kerala, India and its neighbouring states in South Asia.

{"id": "Tom Henke", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Henke", "title": "Tom Henke", "text": "Thomas Anthony Henke (born December 21, 1957), nicknamed \"The Terminator\", is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He was one of the most dominant and feared closers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, pitching for the Texas Rangers (1982–1984, 1993–1994), Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1992), and St. Louis Cardinals (1995).\n\nOn the mound, Henke was easily recognizable by the large-rimmed glasses he wore at a time when many players began using contact lenses.  At a height of 6' 5\", he cast an imposing figure and dominated batters with his hard fastball early in the count, and his forkball for the strikeout.  Henke struck out 9.8 batters per 9 innings pitched over his career.\n\nEarly life\nTom Henke was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and started out throwing every night to his father, who caught his pitches while sitting on a five-gallon bucket. \"Every kid should have a dad like that\", Henke said. He grew up in Taos, Missouri and attended Blair Oaks High School. After high school, Henke played at East Central Junior College. In 1980, a couple of friends, who believed Henke had pro-caliber stuff, told him they would buy the beer if he showed up at a talent evaluation opportunity; he did and was noticed.\n\nCareer\nHenke was drafted on June 5, 1979, by the Seattle Mariners in the 20th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. On January 11, 1980, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the first round (24th pick) of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft (January Secondary) but again did not sign. Henke signed with the Texas Rangers after being selected in the fourth round of the 1980 amateur draft (June Secondary).\n\nTexas Rangers (1982–1984)\nAfter signing with the Rangers, Henke was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Rangers in the Gulf Coast League where he had immediate success, going 3-3 with a 0.95 ERA in 38 innings, earning a promotion to the Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. In 1981, Henke started the season back at Asheville, where his 8-6 record with 3 saves and 2.93 ERA in 92 innings earned him a promotion to the AA Tulsa Drillers in the Texas League. Henke spent the entire 1982 minor league season back at Tulsa, despite putting up similarly impressive numbers (14 saves with a 2.67 ERA and 100 strikeouts in  innings). He did, however, see time with the Rangers at the end of the season and made his major league debut on September 10. In 1983, Henke was finally promoted to the Oklahoma City 89ers in the American Association, but again his development stalled and he spent much of the next three seasons at AAA. Despite strong numbers in the minors and similar numbers during his intermittent times in Texas, Henke was labeled as a pitcher who had trouble finding the strike zone (finishing with 20 walks in  innings with the Rangers in 1984) and appeared to be the odd man out in the Rangers' bullpen.\n\nToronto Blue Jays (1985–1992)\nHowever, Henke was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Rangers on January 24, 1985, as a free agent compensation pick. After blazing through the hitters at AAA Syracuse to the tune of a 0.88 ERA and 18 saves in  innings over 38 appearances, he won the International League Most Valuable Pitcher Award in 1985. Henke was promoted to Toronto during the 1985 pennant drive and never looked back, not allowing a run in his first 11 appearances and finished the season with 13 saves. Henke was then made the team's closer in 1986, and played a major role in the Toronto Blue Jays' successful run from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, finishing with 217 saves with the team and helping Toronto to its first championship, a six-game defeat of the Atlanta Braves in the 1992 World Series.\n\nTexas Rangers II (1993–1994) \nIn 1993, as a free agent, Henke signed with the Texas Rangers for two years. Henke had a career-high 40 saves in 1993. In 1994, he had only 15 saves due to spending time on the disabled list.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1995)\nHenke, age 37, signed with the Cardinals for the 1995 season after two years with the Texas Rangers. The closer converted his first 22 saves for the team in 1995 ending with 36 total saves for the year. Henke was honored with the St. Louis Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association (BBWAA) J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award. Despite having just finished one of the best seasons of his career and 22nd in MVP voting,\n Henke decided to retire at the end of the 1995 season. \"I’ve always admired guys who have gone out at the top of their game,\" Henke said. \"Sometimes you have to look at what’s the most important thing in life. I’d like to see my kids grow up.\"\n\nCareer milestones\nOver his 14-year career, Henke was named to the All-Star team twice: 1987, when he led the American League with 34 saves and 62 games finished, and 1995, his last season, and only season in the National League. He also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1995. \n\nHenke was the seventh reliever to eclipse the 300 saves plateau and when he retired his 311 career saves ranked 5th on the all-time career list. \n\nOther career accomplishments are:\n14 MLB season, 789.2 IP\n2.67 ERA\n1.092 WHIP\n255 walks to 861 Ks for a 3.38 SO/BB ratio\n.982 fielding percentage\nPlayoff stats: 19.2 IP / 2-0 / 1.83 ERA / 0.966 WHIP / 5 saves (all saves in 1992 playoffs for World Champion Blue Jays.)\n\nPersonal\nHenke lives on his  farm in Taos, Missouri, with his family: wife Kathy and children Linsay, Ryan, Kim, and Amanda (who has Down syndrome). \n\nHenke met his wife Kathy in college. \"My catcher one day said, 'Let's go to McDonald's' and Kathy was working there at the time\", Henke said. \"She sold me a Big Mac and I was done. She was tall and athletic and I was pretty shy. Turns out we had a class together and started talking\".\n\nComing from a small town with a population under 900, Henke admitted he initially had to overcome a fear of big cities. \"I hated going to New York City\", he said. \"I felt like a fish out of water there. I’d go from the hotel to Yankee Stadium and that's it. It took me two or three years before I went out to visit the Statue of Liberty and I never took the subway.\" On living in Toronto, Henke said \"I rented an apartment downtown for two or three years and that wasn’t for me. I’m just a guy from a small town and that's where I’m most comfortable\".\n\nCharity involvement \nSince 1995, Henke has teamed with the Jefferson City, Missouri Cosmo Club to hold the annual Tom Henke Charity Classic Golf Tournament which raises money for the Special Learning Center, a school for handicapped children. He also volunteers with Down syndrome charities, the Special Olympics and the Cancer Society, and is on the board of directors with the Missouri Department of Mental Health.\n\nIn popular culture \nHenke's nickname, \"The Terminator\", was given to him by teammate John Cerutti in 1985 after they saw the movie The Terminator together.\n\nThe Ballad Of Tom Henke was written as a tribute to Henke's life story and \"termination\" of opposing batters. The  45 was released in 1985. Side 2 has The Tom Henke Rag song, an instrumental.\n\nHenke appeared in a TV commercial for Aqua Velva.\n\nHonors \n\nIn 2000, Henke was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. \n\nOn August 9, 2009, the Toronto Blue Jays honored Henke with a figurine giveaway bearing his likeness.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, Henke threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Busch Stadium during the Washington Nationals vs St. Louis Cardinals baseball game.\n\nOn January 24, 2011, Henke was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Hall during a ceremony at St Marys, Ontario, on June 18, 2011.\n\nOn August 14, 2016, a final ceremony of three with Blue Jays' all-time greats was held to celebrate the club's 40th Anniversary. Henke represented the bullpen along with Duane Ward and Mike Timlin. Former Blue Jays starters Roy Halladay, Dave Stieb, Pat Hentgen and Juan Guzman were welcomed back too. The entire group exemplified top arms in club history.\n\nIn November 2018, Henke was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSee also\n\nList of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTom Henke at Baseball Almanac\n\n1957 births\nLiving people\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Canada\nAmerican League All-Stars\nAmerican League saves champions\nAsheville Tourists players\nBaseball players from Kansas City, Missouri\nCanadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\nGulf Coast Rangers players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nOklahoma City 89ers players\nPeople from Cole County, Missouri\nSt. Louis Cardinals players\nSyracuse Chiefs players\nTexas Rangers players\nToronto Blue Jays players\nTulsa Drillers players", "machine_abstract": "Henke is the author of several books on computer science and software engineering, including The Art of Software Testing (2002), Test-Driven Development by Example (2005) and Extreme Programming Explained (2006).

{"id": "Syria–Turkey relations", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria%E2%80%93Turkey%20relations", "title": "Syria–Turkey relations", "text": "Turkey shares its longest common border with Syria; various geographic and historical links also tie the two neighbouring countries together.\n\nThe traditionally tense relations between Turkey and Syria had been due to disputes including the self annexation of the Hatay Province to Turkey in 1939, water disputes resulting from the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syria's support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (abbreviated as PKK) and the now-dissolved Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (abbreviated as ASALA) which has been recognised as a terrorist organisation by NATO, the EU, and many other countries. Relations improved greatly after October 1998, when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled by the Syrian authorities. However, the Syrian civil war has once again strained relations between the two countries, leading to the suspension of diplomatic contact. A serious incident occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012, resulting in Turkey calling an emergency meeting of NATO.\n\nSyria had maintained an embassy in Ankara and two consulates–general in Istanbul and Gaziantep. Turkey had an embassy in Damascus and a consulate–general in Aleppo. Diplomatic relations between the countries were severed in March 2012, due to the Syrian civil war. Turkey is a full member of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) while Syria's membership was suspended due to the civil war.\n\nHistory\n\nTurkish rule pre-WWI\nTurkish dynasties managed to rule Syria and the region starting from the Tulunids in the late 9th century, followed by Ikhshidids, Seljuq Empire, Burid dynasty, Artuqids, and Zengids until late 12th century. In 1516, Syria was annexed by the Ottoman Empire until the WWI in the early 20th century.\n\nHatay annexation\n\nIn 1938, the Sanjak of Alexandretta became independent from the French mandate of Syria as the Republic of Hatay, and following a referendum, 8 months later in 1939, it decided to join Turkey as the Hatay Province. This self-annexation was never recognized by Syria, which continues to show the Hatay Province of Turkey as part of Syria's territory on maps.\n\nAt present, Syrians hold the view that this land is historically Syrian and was illegally ceded in the late 1930s to Turkey by France – the mandatory occupying power of Syria (between 1920 and 1946). The Turks remember Syria as a former Ottoman vilayet. In 1938, the Turkish Army went into the former Syrian Mediterranean province with French approval and expelled most of its Alawite Arab and Armenian inhabitants. Before this, Alawi Arabs and Armenians were the majority of the provincial population. For the referendum, Turkey crossed tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta to vote.\n\nIn 1938, the province declared its independence from France and the following 29 June, the parliament of the newly declared Hatay Republic voted to join Turkey. This referendum has been labeled both \"phoney\" and \"rigged\", and that it was a way for the French to let Turks take over the area, hoping that they would turn on Hitler.  Syrians still consider this land as integral Syrian territory. Syrians call this land Liwaaa aliskenderuna rather than the Turkish name of Hatay.\n\nWater politics\nWater disputes have been a major source of conflict as Turkey has constructed several dams on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers as part of the Southeastern Anatolia Project- GAP to develop the region. The project GAP was aimed at reducing the harsh living conditions of the Southeastern provinces of Turkey by building 19 dams on the rivers of Euphrates and Tigris. This project, however, would seriously reduce Syrian water resources.\n\nIn addition to this, Euphrates and Tigris are not the only rivers that tangles Turkish-Syrian relations, the water distribution of Orantes River which pours into Mediterranean from the province of disputed Hatay also rises problems between two states.\n\nSupport to the PKK\nTurkey has condemned Syria for supporting the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization internationally by a number of states and organizations, including the US, NATO, and the EU and has claimed that Syria employed Alois Brunner to train Kurdish militants for attacks against Turkey.\n\nThe two countries came to the brink of war when Turkey threatened military action if Syria continued to shelter Abdullah Öcalan in Damascus, his long-time safe haven. Relations have improved since October 1998, when Öcalan was expelled by Damascus and Syria pledged to stop harbouring the PKK militants and the 1999 signing of the Adana agreement, following his subsequent capture in Kenya, envisaged security cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHelicopter downing\n\nIn October 1989, 2 Syrian Mig-21's flew  into Turkish airspace where they shot down a Turkish aircraft. All five of the crew on the Turkish aircraft died.\n\nDiplomatic thaw 2003–2011\nIn The New Turkey (Granta Books, 2005), BBC correspondent Chris Morris claims that Syria was \"for years a bitter foe\" as \"Turkey's secular democracy, its application for EU membership and its close relationship with the United States have long been regarded in Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus with intense suspicion. Islamists look at the secular state which buried the caliphate and think 'betrayal'; and Arab nationalists still haven't forgotten that Turks are their former colonial rulers.\" \"But there's been a thaw, especially since the AKP came to power,\" and \"the new Turkish model – trying to mix greater democracy and Islam together – is now the subject of curiosity and not a little envy.\"\n\nThe Turkish Parliament's refusal to cooperate militarily with the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point in Syrian-Turkish bilateral relations as Syria's perceptions of Turkey as incapable of acting independently were altered.\n\nThe first ever visit to Turkey by a Syrian President was made by Bashar al-Assad to Ankara in January 2004. In late 2004, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan flew to Damascus to sign a free trade agreement, in the follow-up to former Turkish President Turgut Özal's high-level trade negotiations with Syrian authorities in the 1990s and Erdoğan's own recently successful bid to initiate a Turkish EU accession which would allow Europe, \"to extend its reach to the borders Syria, Iraq and Iran.\" On 3 April 2007, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Syrian President Bashar Al Assad attended the opening ceremony of the Aleppo International Stadium.\n\nIn 2005, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer went to visit Damascus, despite U.S. objections, during the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon.\n\nIn 2008, Turkey was, as a sign of mutual trust in Damascus and Jerusalem, invited to play the role of facilitator between Syria and Israel to solve their dispute over control over the Golan Heights, but these talks were abandoned after four rounds, which included a visit by Syrian President Bashir al-Assad to Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan at Bodrum in August, following the deterioration in Turkey-Israel relations over the 2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict,\n\nMilitary cooperation\nOn 26 April 2009, the two states announced an \"unprecedented\" three-day military manoeuvre involving ground forces along their mutual border in what was described as \"a step further in their ever-expanding cooperation.\" According to Turkish military sources, \"The aim of the exercise is to boost friendship, cooperation, and confidence between the two countries land forces, and to increase the ability of border troops to train and work together.\"  The exercise which commenced on 27 April involved teams from each country crossing the border to visit outposts.\n\nVisiting Syrian Defense Minister Hasan Turkmani and Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gönül also signed a letter of intent giving the green light for cooperation in the defence industry, on the sidelines of the 9th International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF'09) that commenced in Istanbul the same day, as a sign of the level of political relations reached between the two states, although a Turkish defence industry source emphasised that, \"it does not mean that the two countries will immediately enter into cooperation in arms production.\"\n\n2009 Turkish Presidential visit to Syria\nTurkish President Gül's 15–17 May official visit to Syria was made at the invitation of Damascus in reciprocation of Syrian President Assad's 2007 official visit to Turkey. A senior Turkish diplomat confirmed that, \"The main topic on the agenda and the goal of the visit is the maintenance of momentum that has built up in bilateral relations within the last decade.\" The Turkish delegation included Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Çağlayan, Agriculture Minister and Culture and Tourism Minister Ertuğrul Günay.\n\nShortly before the visit new Syrian Ambassador to Turkey, Nidal Qablan confirmed that Syria was ready to restart the Turkish mediated peace negotiations with Israel and Gül supported the call, following his meeting with Assad, stating that, \"We have heard Syria say it is ready to resume the peace talks from the point where they stopped with the previous [Israeli] government. We in Turkey are also ready.\" Assad confirmed, \"Turkey's role is important because we have trust in Turkey.\" Israeli President Shimon Peres dismissed these calls stating, \"The Syrians should be ready to talk. If President al-Assad wants peace, why is he shy? We suggested direct talks many times. He thinks direct talks are a prize for Israel. It's not a prize. It's normal.\"\n\nFriction due to Syrian Civil War\n\nSince the start of Syrian Civil War, relations between Syria and Turkey greatly deteriorated. The Syrian conflict began to impact Turkey when at least 3,000 Syrian refugees fled Syria as a consequence of such incidents as Syrian army operation in Jisr ash-Shugur in June 2011. In June 2011, Turkish prime minister Erdogan described to Anadolu Agency, his feeling that \"They [Syria] are not acting in a humane manner. This is savagery.\" However, at the beginning, the Turkish government refrained from describing the Syrians who fled to Turkey as \"refugees\" or \"asylum-seekers\", instead referring to them as guests, and Erdogan, while demanding the implementation of promised reforms by the Syrian government, initially refrained from calling for Bashar al-Assad's departure, although he later would.\n\nTimeline \n\nOn 9 August 2011, the BBC and other news sites reported that Turkey sent its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, to Syria to give the government a \"tough\" message. Erdogan has said that he is becoming impatient with the \"savagery\" of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ahmet Davutoğlu also announced that \"We are completely suspending all of these trade relations, all agreements between Turkey and Syria have been suspended.\"\n\nThe Turkish pilgrim bus attack occurred on 21 November 2011 when two buses carrying Turkish pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia came under fire from Syrian soldiers. The attack occurred at a checkpoint near Homs, as a convoy of eight or nine Turkish buses was making its way towards Turkey via the Bab Hawa border crossing. The gunfire left two people injured. According to a driver, when told that the passengers were Turks, \"Syrian soldiers emerged from behind sandbags and cursed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan... Then they suddenly opened fire at the bus.\"\n\nOn 9 April 2012, the Syrian envoy to Turkey was summoned after Syrian forces fired across the Syria–Turkey border. At least two were killed and many others injured in the incident.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, Syria shot down a Turkish Air Force RF-4E reconnaissance jet near the Turkish-Syrian border. The Syrian military alleges the jet had violated Syrian airspace. However, Turkish president Abdullah Gül and other spokesmen have not confirmed this and emphasized that brief incursions into neighboring airspace by high-speed jets are routine occurrences. Gül stated that \"it is not possible to cover over a thing like this. Whatever is necessary will no doubt be done.\" The Turkish and Syrian navies conducted a search for Turkish airmen downed by the incident.\n\nIn August 2012, Turkey began to hold high level meetings with the USA on plans to replace the Syrian government.\n\nOn 3 October 2012, Turkey attacked troops in Syria, after a Syrian mortar shell killed five people. Turkish parliament approved cross border operations. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan announced 5 October \"We are not interested in war, but we're not far from it either,\"\n\nOn 10 October 2012, Turkish Air Force F-16s intercepted a Syrian Air Airbus A320, flight RB442 from Moscow to Damascus, in Turkish airspace and forced it to land at Ankara Esenboğa Airport, suspecting it was carrying Russian-made weapons. Inspectors confiscated military communications equipment and items \"thought to be missile parts\". Syria accused Turkey of \"air piracy\". On the same day the airline chief said in an interview that Turkey violated the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation Syria subsequently banned Turkish civilian flights from its airspace.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, an anti-aircraft shell from Syria hit a health center in Turkey's Hatay Province.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, two car bombs exploded in the town of Reyhanlı, Hatay Province, Turkey. At least 43 people were killed and 140 more were injured in the attack. The car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 local time (10:45 GMT) and the second exploded about 15 minutes later. People attempting to help those injured in the first explosion were caught in the second blast. This attack was the deadliest single act of terrorism to occur on Turkish soil.\n\nOn 23 March 2014, Turkey shot down a Syrian combat jet in Hatay Province near Turkish-Syrian border. The initial announcement was made by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech during the 2014 Turkish local elections campaign. Turkey claimed that two Turkish Air Force F-16s downed the plane that breached Turkish airspace and ignored warnings, as a result of the infringement of the new engagement rules declared by the Republic of Turkey, after Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance plane on 22 June 2012. The pilot jumped off the plane according to witness reports. Syria condemned the aggression and argued that the plane was following rebels and it did not violate Turkish airspace. However, according to the new engagement rules, two countries could defend themselves if the other come close to their borders, perceiving the action as a threat.\n\nOn 18 June, based on information provided by a Euro-Med Monitor team, Turkish border guards have killed eleven Syrians, including four children and two women, while they were trying to cross the Turkish-Syrian border by opening the fire directly on them once they reached Syria's Idlib province. The Turkish government claimed that the authorities meant to kill the smugglers and terrorists not the civilians in search of protecting their borders. Some eyewitness testimonies from refugee families confirmed to the Euro-Med Monitor team that all the ones who were killed by the Turkish guards were civilians. \nMost of the deaths, reached to the borders, ran away from ISIS control before they got and hid in the northern Aleppo countryside for 15 days. Testimonies collected by Euro-Med Monitor team said that a smuggler help the victims get to the Syria's Idlib province. The victims were deceived by the smuggler when he told them that the Turkish borders are safe and gave them the legal permission to cross the borders. Turkish border guards have killed 60 Syrians before as they were trying to cross the border.\n\nOn 24 August 2016, Turkey and Turkish backed rebels attacked ISIS positions across the border, from Jarabulus west to Al-Rai, taking a series of towns and taking a hold of a strip 5 to 20 km deep.

{"id": "Zhuluo County", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuluo%20County", "title": "Zhuluo County", "text": "Zhuluo County () was a political division in Taiwan from 1684 to 1787, during Qing Dynasty rule of the island. Initially encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan, the county shrank in size as the population and economy of the north and central western plains grew and new counties were created out of the developed areas; the Zhuluo county was eventually limited to a under-developed area in south-western Taiwan. In 1787 the county underwent further restructuring and was renamed Chiayi County.\n\nName\nThe city now known as Chiayi originally took its name from the aboriginal tribe who lived there: the Tirosen. The former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (), a representation of the original Formosan-language name. This town (in reality a village of perhaps one or two thousand people) gave its name to the surrounding area, dropping the -shan to leave Zhuluo as the name for the county as a whole. In some English-language texts the spellings Chu-lo or Choolo are used.\n\n1684–1723\nWhen the Qing wrested the island from the control of the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, Taiwan was made a prefecture under the administration of Fujian Province. This new Taiwan Prefecture included three hien or districts; Zhuluo County covered the central western plains and the north. \n\nThe county started as a catch-all for the areas not incorporated in one of the other, smaller, more developed counties. Zhuluo County was initially made up of four Villages () and 34 Communities ( - the name normally given to aboriginal settlements). The villages were all near the border with Taiwan County, with the communities making up the rest of Zhuluo County. At this point in time the county covered 18,499 km2, more than half the total area of Taiwan, with the county seat in the Jialixing area of Kaihua Village (modern-day Jiali District, Tainan).\n\nIn 1697 the Qing Imperial official Yu Yonghe visited the area and wrote that \"Zhuluo and Fengshan have no residents, only savages\" i.e. there were no Han Chinese settlements in the county. In 1694 there was only one registered market in Zhuluo as opposed to 17 in the far smaller Taiwan County, a situation which reflected the disparity in the Han Chinese populations in both counties.\n\nIn the first two decades of the eighteenth century Han settlers began to encroach more extensively into Zhuluo, with significant Chinese populations cultivating in the areas around modern-day Douliu and Changhua City. Settlers who attempted to move further north were however violently resisted by aboriginal tribes. In 1704 the administrative seat of the county was relocated to Zhuluoshan, today known as Chiayi City.\n\n1723–1787\nBy 1723, following the Zhu Yigui rebellion, the number of Han Chinese settlements in central and northern Taiwan had increased dramatically. To facilitate better administration Zhuluo was split into three. The northernmost section, corresponding to modern-day Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, and Miaoli County, was called Tamsui Subprefecture (淡水廳). Changhua County (彰化縣) was also created, encompassing the area of modern Changhua County, Taichung, half of Yunlin County and three townships of Nantou County. The remaining area, some 3,844 km2 from the Huwei River (虎尾溪) to the borders with Taiwan County and the ungoverned aboriginal areas, remained under the name of Zhuluo County.\n\nIn 1787, the Lin Shuangwen rebellion against Qing rule began, and rebels gained control of almost the entire island. Imperial troops regained control of the city and vicinity in 1788. In 1787, the county was renamed Chiayi County () to reflect the fidelity of the city during the incident.\n\nSee also\n History of Taiwan\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFormer counties of Taiwan\n1684 establishments in Taiwan\n1787 disestablishments in Taiwan\nQing dynasty", "machine_abstract": "Zhuolu county (Chinese: 诸暨市; pinyin: Zhūzī) is one of the prefecture-level counties in Shaanxi, China.

{"id": "Lorraine 37L", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine%2037L", "title": "Lorraine 37L", "text": "The Lorraine 37L or , (\"tank supply tractor 1937 L\") is a light tracked armoured vehicle developed by the Lorraine company during the interwar period or interbellum, before the Second World War, to an April 1936 French Army requirement for a fully armoured munition and fuel supply carrier to be used by tank units for front line resupply. A prototype was built in 1937 and production started in 1939. In this period, two armoured personnel carriers and a tank destroyer project were also based on its chassis. Mainly equipping the larger mechanised units of the French Infantry arm, the type was extensively employed during the Battle of France in 1940. After the defeat of France, clandestine manufacture was continued in Vichy France, culminating in a small AFV production after the liberation and bringing the total production to about 630 in 1945. Germany used captured vehicles in their original role of carrier and later, finding the suspension system to be particularly reliable, rebuilt many into tank destroyers () of the Marder I type or into self-propelled artillery.\n\nDevelopment\nIn 1934, the order was given to design a munition supply vehicle to increase the operational range of independent tank units. The same year, the Renault 36R was selected for further development; three hundred were ordered from 1938. However, this tractor was only partially armoured; on 17 April 1936, a new set of specifications was drafted for a fully armoured vehicle to deliver fuel and munitions to tanks fighting on the frontline.\n\nEarly in 1937, the  company finished a prototype. It was a lengthened version of a proposed replacement type for the 1931 model Renault UE Chenillette tracked infantry supply tractor. In February 1937, the matériel commission, the , was ordered to test the prototype and to complete an evaluation before 1 November 1937, even if testing had not been finished. The prototype was only presented on 9 July and tested until 4 August. It was equipped with a 2371 cc Delahaye four cylinder 124 F engine. Although the vehicle attained a maximum speed of , this dropped to an unacceptably low  when an intended fuel trailer was attached. It was therefore returned to the factory and a more powerful Delahaye 135 engine and stronger clutch were fitted. This vehicle was tested between 22 September and 29 October and achieved the desired .\n\nProduction\nThe commission approved the type during late 1937, being especially impressed by the rugged suspension system. It was decided in September 1939 to reserve the total production capacity of the suspension elements for the larger tractor. This implied that the shorter Lorraine replacement for the Renault UE, though also favoured over other candidates, would not be taken into production: an order of hundred made early 1939 was that month shifted towards the longer version.\n\nIn 1938, three orders were made: of 78, 100 and another 100 vehicles of the  (TRC 37L); in 1939, before the war, a fourth order of 100 followed, and then a fifth of 74, to which was added the replacement order of 100 for a total of 552. The first vehicle was delivered by Lorraine on 11 January 1939; 212 had been delivered on 1 September 1939.\n\nThe ambitious plans made after the outbreak of war for the expansion of the number of armoured divisions meant that the Lorraine 37L orders had to be enlarged accordingly, bringing the total to 1012. The intended initial production rate was fifty per month, to be expanded to seventy. To assist in the manufacture, a second assembly hall was erected by Fouga at Béziers, where it was hoped that it could produce at first twenty and later thirty vehicles per month. In reality, this number was never attained; e.g. 20 were made in January, 32 by both companies in May 1940. On 26 May 1940, 432 vehicles had been delivered to the army by Lorraine and Fouga out of 440 produced. Production continued after that date and an estimated total of about 480 to 490 had been reached by 25 June 1940, the end of the Battle of France.\n\nDescription\nBeing derived from a  project, the Lorraine 37 L was a rather small vehicle, just 1.57 metres wide. Space had been found by lengthening the chassis to 4.22 metres, making it rather oblong. Lacking a turret or superstructure its height was also not excessive at just 1.215 metres. The small dimensions combined with a light armour — nine millimetres for the vertical riveted plates, six for the top and bottom and twelve for the cast rounded nose section — ensured a low weight: the basic TRC 37L weighs just 5.24 metric tonnes empty, the trailer adding 1.2 tonnes.\n\nGiven the vehicle's low weight, the suspension was quite robust and exceptionally reliable in comparison with other systems used on French armour of the time, that were either too complicated or too flimsy. Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie was allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the upper track run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks were  wide. The drive sprockets were in the front and driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them. Entrance to the compartment was by two wide horizontal hatches, the upper hinging upwards, allowing the driver an unobstructed view if opened, the lower hinging downwards.\n\nThe centrally positioned engine compartment was separated by a bulkhead from the driver compartment in front of it. The external silencer was on the left of the vehicle under an armoured covering. All vehicles in the series were powered by a Delahaye Type 135 six-cylinder 3.556 litre engine developing  at 2800 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 35 km/h and an average speed of 20 km/h. The wading capacity was 60 centimetres, a trench of 130 centimetres could be crossed and an incline of 50% climbed. There was a fuel supply of 114 litres, allowing for a range of 137 kilometres. There were five forward drives and one rear drive.\n\nAt the back was an armoured ammunition bin; a load of 810 kilograms can be carried, bringing the weight to 6.05 tonnes. As with the Renault UE, the TRC 37L was supplied with a tracked, armoured trailer with two road wheels per side, mostly used to carry a 565-litre fuel tank to supply the tank units; total load capacity is 690 kg for a total for the combination of 1.5 tonnes and a total weight of the trailer of 1890 kg. At 155 cm, the trailer was somewhat narrower than the main vehicle, and higher at 133 cm. It increased the length of the combination to 6.9 metres. The trailer also carried a Vulcano fuel pump and stowage boxes for lubrication oil, greases, water and assorted equipment to serve the tank maintenance teams.\n\nThe Lorraine 37Ls were painted in the standard army green, a rather greyish colour, over which a brown pattern of dark earth was sprayed.\n\nTactical function and operational history\nIn 1939, the Lorraine 37 L was gradually introduced to the supply units of the tank battalions. This coincided with a change in tactical thinking about the use of armour. In the early thirties, French doctrine had favoured the construction of ever deeper defensive belts to counter infantry infiltration tactics to defeat enemy attacks before they could develop into full-scale manoeuvre warfare, a field at which the French were aware being less adept than their most likely adversary, Germany. Expecting any possible enemy to defend himself likewise, the armour branch of the French Infantry became much preoccupied with the vexing problem of how to break through similar in-depth positions itself, emphasizing close cooperation with the foot soldier. Far less attention was paid to the next phase: the envelopment of the enemy forces.\n\nThe situation changed in the late thirties. Having at last built a considerable number of modern and well-armoured tanks, the Infantry became confident in its ability to break the enemy line, if sufficient artillery and air support was provided within a combined arms tactic. At the same time the political situation made it likely that large-scale offensives were needed to bring Germany to its knees. Though few officers advocated the creation of armoured divisions able to execute both the breakthrough and the strategic exploitation phase — these required trained personnel in numbers that simply would not be available — it was understood that the \"manoeuvre mass\" of tanks effecting the break would immediately have to envelop the defensive enemy position and defeat counterattacking enemy armour reserves, otherwise the momentum of the attack would be lost and the breach would not be kept open long enough for the motorised divisions and cavalry armoured divisions to be launched to quickly occupy and hold strategic key positions.\n\nHowever, this posed a serious logistical problem: trucks would not be able to closely follow the tanks on the battlefield. The prescribed procedure for resupplying was for the tanks to return to their start positions to be refitted. While this had still been practical in the previous war with its much slower tempo of operations, it was unacceptable in modern warfare. The tanks would have to be supplied in the field to continue their advance as soon as possible. Thus a tracked supply vehicle was needed that could overcome the expected poor terrain conditions, with many shell-craters and trenches, and it had to be armoured to protect against shell-fragments, given that the breakthrough sector would likely be in range of concentrated enemy artillery.\n\nThe type was provided to the armoured units of both the Infantry and the Cavalry. Each independent tank battalion of the Infantry, or , had an organic strength of twelve Lorraine tractors: four in the  (supply platoon) of each of its three companies. The BCCs incorporated in the armoured divisions and equipped with the Char B1 or Char B1 bis had 27 TRC 37Ls: each of their three companies had six tractors in its supply platoon and furthermore a single tractor organic to each of its three tank platoons. This extra allotment was made to compensate for the large fuel consumption of these heavy tanks, that, apart from being simply bigger, had also a rather limited range. Each group of three tanks was in their case thus directly followed by its own fuel supply.\n\nWhen, during the Battle of France, independent companies were formed, these, too, had their Lorraine tractors — an increased allotment of eight if a Char B1 bis unit, otherwise the standard allotment of four. However, the older FT 17 battalions only used fuel trucks. Likewise, the TRC 37L was not in common use in the colonies; however, when the 67e BCC, which was equipped with the Char D1, was brought over from Tunisia in June, it was provided with tractors. The motorised infantry divisions did not use the TRC 37L.\n\nIn the Cavalry, each squadron of twenty tanks had three Lorraine tractors, for a total of 24 for each mechanised light division. The AMR 35 or Panhard 178 units did not use the type, just trucks as its speed was considered insufficient. It was proposed to remedy this by fitting a stronger engine, bringing the speed to 50 km/h. The TRC 37L was also not present in the cavalry light divisions.\n\nIn practice, the supply vehicles would mainly move by road and meet with the tanks at predetermined rendez-vous points. Refuelling was relatively quick as the Vulcano could theoretically pump 565 litres in fifteen minutes. To completely refill a heavy tank would normally take about forty to sixty minutes. The trailer fuel reservoirs could themselves be replenished by the company fuel truck carrying 3600 litres of petrol. The company supplies could again be restocked from battalion stocks, moved by trucks loaded with fifty litre fuel drums. This method of distribution ensured a sufficient fuel supply on the tactical level, but was too cumbersome for strategic movements: if large distances had to be covered on track, the tanks would be directly refuelled from fuel trucks.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded on 10 May, French tank units had an organic strength of 606 Lorraine 37Ls; the numbers produced were thus insufficient to provide each unit with its official complement. About a third had to do without. That day French general headquarters decided to increase the TRC 37L strength of  and  by a half; these armoured divisions had been earmarked as reserves against an expected German breakthrough attempt in the Gembloux Gap and the low range of the Char B1 bis worried French command. To free enough tractors, , still in the process of being constituted, had to give up its twelve TRC L37s to . However, contrary to French expectations, the main German breakthrough would be at Sedan and  was sent to block it — and despite its larger number of fuel tractors,  was still surprised by  while refuelling on 15 May.\n\nDuring the campaign, the TRC 37L crews quickly saw the need for some armament and began to improvise machine-gun mounts on their vehicles.\n\nVariants\n\nThe first development from the TRC 37L was an armoured personnel carrier, the  (\"Armoured mounted infantry vehicle 38L\"). Like the TRC 37L, this Lorraine 38L was equipped with an armoured tracked trailer. The total capacity was twelve men: the driver and one passenger in the driving compartment, four in the former cargo bay, and six in the trailer. To protect the infantry squad, high box-like armoured superstructures were built over both the bin and the trailer, with doors at their back. The loaded weight of the main vehicle was 7.7 tonnes. A total of 240 VBCP 38L vehicles were ordered, of which nine had been delivered on 1 September 1939 and around 150 by 25 June 1940. In view of the war threat, the order was made before the prototype could be tested. Of all participants in the Battle of France, the French army would thus be the only to employ a fully tracked APC. The vehicles were intended for the , the (single) mechanised infantry battalion within the , or armoured division of the Infantry. However, on 10 May, they had not yet been allocated to these units, who still used half-tracks. During May, the vehicles were hurriedly taken into use by the 5e BCP and 17e BCP of the 1re DCr and 2nd DCr respectively. The 4e DCr did not receive any.\n\nAn improved model, the VBCP 39L, was created by expanding the cargo bay to carry eight passengers, apart from the two crew members. This model had no trailer and a total capacity of ten persons; extra room was found by raising the upper deck — the passenger compartment was open-topped — and constructing a more forward sloped armour glacis, contiguous with the nose section; the type thus resembled postwar APCs. Some two hundred VBCP 39L vehicles were ordered, to replace the 38L on the production lines from the 241st vehicle onwards, but none had been delivered by June 1940, the manufacture remaining limited to a single prototype. Experimental and limited production models included tank destroyers armed with 47 mm SA 47 guns () and command post vehicles; probably a  prototype was produced.\n\nVichy production\n\nIn 1939 and 1940 the type had been mainly produced in the Lorraine factory at Lunéville. Early 1939 it was decided to erect a factory in a more southern location, less vulnerable to German bombing, at Bagnères-de-Bigorre. This  had not made a single vehicle by the time of the armistice between France and Germany, but it was, like the other tractor-producing Fouga factory at Béziers, located in the unoccupied zone of Vichy France. Limited production continued after June 1940 for a total of about 150, although military models were not officially produced. Some of these vehicles had a shortened chassis, their suspension consisting of only two bogies per side. Lorraine tractors were ostensively fitted for use in forestry and construction; in reality they constituted a clandestine armoured fighting vehicle production as they could be easily rebuilt. The AMX factory secretly produced armoured bodies for these vehicles, which were stockpiled. The type was called the . After the German occupation of the south of France in November 1942, many of these chassis were hidden. In the spring of 1944, the French resistance attacked the Bagnères factory on orders from London, the allies assuming that it produced vehicles for Germany. To prevent further attacks, the resistance was informed of and involved in the affair in the summer of 1944 by the promise to arm existing vehicles for their use. The first twenty of these were delivered in January 1945, after the liberation, and the factory continued modifying vehicles for the duration of the war at a rate of about twenty a month, often by fitting an armoured superstructure, armed with a light or heavy machine-gun, to the front or back of the chassis.\n\nGerman use\nA considerable number of Lorraine tractors, about 360, fell into German hands. Due to its reliability, the type was well suited to the mobile tactics the Germans favoured in 1941 and 1942. They were first used as such, renamed the . As the Germans themselves had not produced a similar type, the Lorraine tractors filled a requirement for fully tracked supply vehicles as  or . In July and August 1942, Major Alfred Becker directed the conversion of 170 of these vehicles into the  or Marder I, a 75 mm equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun. At the same time, 106 were converted into self-propelled artillery: 94 into the  and twelve into the . Also, an artillery observation vehicle was provided: the , thirty of which were produced. A single conversion entailed the fitting of a Soviet 122 mm howitzer: the .  The Germans also employed the VBCP 38L as the Lorraine 38L(f).\n\nFor a time, it has also been assumed that a 47 mm tank destroyer conversion existed: the presumed \"4.7cm Pak181(f) auf PanzerJäger Lorraine Schlepper (f)\", based on preserved photographs that, however, in reality depicted the French  mentioned above, an ad hoc conversion built in June 1940.\n\nGerman designations\n  - The Lorraine tractor as captured.\n  - Supply vehicle\n  - Ammunition carrier\n  - 170 Marder I, a 7.5cm PaK40/1 equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun.\n  - 94 self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 15cm sFH13/1 howitzers.\n  - twelve self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 10.5cm leFH18/40 L/28 howitzers.\n  - An artillery observation vehicle, thirty of which were produced.\n  - A single conversion mounting a Soviet 122 mm howitzer on the Lorraine chassis.\n\nGallery\n\nAfter the war\nLorraine tractors were used after World War II for various experimental roles. A number were sold on the civilian market, being used to carry cranes and digging equipment. However, the factory did not secure, despite lobbying, an order from the French Army, due to the fact that so much discarded Allied matériel could be obtained for free. Likewise, an attempt in 1946 to export the type to Switzerland failed. Some were listed in the army inventories for a few years after the war; the last known user was Syria. The Maurice Dufresne Museum, in Azay-le-Rideau, and the State Military Technical Museum, at Ivanovskoje, exhibit surviving vehicles of the shortened version. Two vehicles of the long version are part of the collection of the  at Dresden.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  Vauvillier, François & Jean-Michel Touraine,  Paris: Editions Ch.

Brilliant would be our son whom you would beget.\" Liadain replied \"Let us not do so, so that my tour is not spoiled for me. If you might come for me again, to my house, I shall come with you.\" They slept together that night, and parted the following day.\n\nHowever, before she and Cuirithir met again, Liadain became a nun. It is uncertain if this is \"a conflict between love and religion [or if] Liadain postpones the marriage to Cuirithir because of her professional interests as a travelling poetess.\"\n\nThe couple seek the spiritual aid of St. Cummine (Cumméne Fota. However, Cuirithir breaks the vow of chastity and is banished to another monastery by Cummine, being also forced to renounce his love of Liadain. He later crosses the sea while Liadain endures penance and prayer before dying of a broken heart.\n\nHistorical basis\nCuirithir and Laidain are believed to have been historical figures alive in 7th-century Ireland, and the basic facts of the story are believed to be true.\n\nVerse\nRuth Lehmann's translation of part of the tale, as told by Liadain:\n\nNo pleasure\nin deed done to loving-one;\ntormenting without measure.\nWhat madness\nnot to give him happiness,\nthough fear of God feed sadness.\nNo ruin,\nhis affair desirable\nthrough pain heaven pursuing.\nCause slender\nthrough me troubled Cuirithir,\nthough I was gentle, tender.\nI'm Liadan;\nit is I loved Cuirithir;\ntruly, though said by heathen.\nBrief hour\ntogether with Cuirithir;\nour closeness then a dower.\nWoods singing\nto me beside Cuirithir\nwith somber sea-sounds dinning.\n\nI wonder\nit would trouble Cuirithir,\nany deal made asunder.\nNo hiding:\nhe was my heart's true lover,\nthough I loved all beside him.\nFlames flowing\nburst my heart, now desperate, dead without him - this knowing.

{"id": "Margaret Scriven", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret%20Scriven", "title": "Margaret Scriven", "text": "Margaret Croft Scriven-Vivian (née Scriven; 17 August 1912 – 25 January 2001) was a British tennis player and the first woman from that country to win the singles title at the French Championships in 1933. She also won the singles title at the 1934 French Championships, defeating Helen Jacobs in the final. She was ranked No. 5 in the world in 1933 and 1934.\n\nEarly life\nMargaret Scriven was born on 18 August 1912 at Chapel Allerton, Leeds. She was educated at home. Her parents were club level tennis players and she played the game from an early age, playing on holiday and entering local tournaments. According to one source, there was a tennis court at her family home and she was coached by her father, Edgar Scriven and by her mother.\n\nCareer\nScriven won the British Junior Championships held at Wimbledon in September 1929. In the final, Scriven defeated Miss P. Burt from Nottingham, 6–1, 6–3.\n\nIn June 1930, Scriven played at the Wimbledon Championships for the first time, where she was beaten in the first round by Miss K. le Messurier.\n\nAt Wimbledon in 1931, Scriven, was far more successful than at first attempt in the previous year. She reached the quarter-finals where she was beaten by the French player, Simonne Mathieu, 1–6, 6–2, 7–5.\n\nIn 1932 she won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, played on the wooden courts at the Queen's Club, after a victory in the final against Kay Stammers.\n\nFor the 1933 French Championships, Scriven was not selected to go with the official British touring party. Instead, she travelled to Paris independently. After beating top British players Mary Heeley and Betty Nuthall on her way to the final,  Scriven won the tournament, beating Simonne Mathieu in the final. She also triumphed in the mixed doubles, partnered by the Australian player, Jack Crawford.\n\nIn early August, 1933, Scriven was part of the losing British team in the Wightman Cup held at Forest Hills, New York.\n\nLater in the same month, Scriven was at Forest Hills for the US Championships. In the singles, she reached the last 16 of the tournament, being knocked out by the American, Josephine Cruickshank. She also competed in the doubles and mixed doubles at the championships. Partnered by the Australian player Jack Crawford, Scriven reached the semi-finals of the mixed doubles.\n\nIn May 1934, Scriven was back at the French Championships, this time as part of the official British team. On 3 June 1934, Scriven retained her French title, beating Helen Jacobs of America, 7–5, 4–6, 6–1. The final started at the late time of 6.30pm and, after two sets had been played, both players appealed against the light. The appeal was turned down, however, and the match continued in twilight. After 3 more games, with Scriven leading 2–1, Jacobs appealed again against the light but was turned down. Scriven went on to win all the remaining games.\n\nAt the French Championships in 1935, Scriven was unable to win the singles for the third time, being beaten in the semi-finals. However, she did win the doubles, partnered by Katherine Stammers.\n\nScriven-Vivian was the last British woman to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament for two consecutive years. In addition, she was the first left-handed woman to win a Grand Slam singles title and was the only unseeded woman ever to win the French Championships or French Open until the 2017 singles title was won by Jeļena Ostapenko.\t\t\n\nShe played for the British Wightman Cup team in 1933, 1934 and 1938.\n\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Scriven-Vivian was ranked in the world top ten from 1933 through 1935, reaching a career high of World No. 5 in those rankings in 1933 and 1934.\n\nPersonal life\nScriven married Harvey Vivian on 28 November 1940 who was a house master and a wartime RAF officer.

{"id": "Claudia Ruggerini", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia%20Ruggerini", "title": "Claudia Ruggerini", "text": "Claudia Ruggerini (and also known as \"Marisa\" 1 February 1922 Milan - 4 June 2016 Rome) was an Italian partisan, activist, doctor, and neuropsychiatrist. During World War II, she joined the Italian Communist Party to overthrow the government of Benito Mussolini in July 1943.\n\nEarly life and family\nClaudia Ruggerini was an Italian neuropsychiatrist, partisan, activist, and physician born in Milan, the former Italian Kingdom, in 1922. Claudia was born into a poor family in Via Padova 36, which was a street of immigrants in the 1920s. Her family was from Brianza. \nHer mother worked as a masseuse and later as a free trader, while her grandmother was a foundling. The women in Claudia’s childhood are what drove and inspired her. Later in life, Claudia always credited her mother’s work ethic and intelligence while looking back on her past academic and professional opportunities. Claudia’s father was a part of the Italian Communist Party. \nHer father was beaten to death in 1934 by a fascists patrol in front of his house when Claudia was just twelve years old. Claudia watched her father from the window as he was horrifically beaten and left for dead.\n\nShe referred to herself as “a nerd,” as she was incredibly studious and had a love for the arts. This love for the arts is what precipitated her determination to bring awareness to anti-fascism. In Venice, where her Mother went to massage rich clients, Claudia went to churches, to the Biennale of art, and to see films of the film festival, which could not circulate in the fascist and provincial Italy. Claudia’s rebellious nature could be seen in her character since early childhood. In Kindergarten, Claudia’s teachers discovered that she was left-handed, a calamity that, at the time, needed to be “corrected.” While the teachers succeeded in retraining Claudia to use her right hand, this encounter seemed to awaken the “rebel” in her. Her rebellious, witty nature is what eventually propelled her to join the Milanese anti-fascist resistance against Benito Mussolini\n\nEducation\nWhen Claudia started high school, a teacher directed her to the humanities, and in one session, she obtained her teaching diploma in classical studies. Afterwards, Claudia began her studies at University of Industrial Chemistry, then switching her focal point to medicine in 1942. When at the university, she met Hans, who was her \"sweetheart\", and (as she would only discover after the war) had emigrated from Vienna because he was a Jew. Claudia then joined the Garibaldi Brigade, the fifth column on behalf of the CLN inside San Vittore. Hans, in fact, had been locked up there, and through a fortuitous series of events, Claudia won the trust of the Germans who ran the prison. She stated \"I was living in fear.\" Despite the fear, she did not give up, risking the worst.\nUpon studying medicine, Claudia met several anti-fascist students. In July 1943, Claudia met the leader of the Neapolitan Communist Party Antonio D'Ambrosio, one of the most respected and popular leaders of the Milanese resistance, and alongside her fellow anti-fascist peers, Claudia diligently began to fight for the cause, clearly inspired by the horrific death of her father. She was the only woman in the initiative committee, among intellectuals that the Communist D'Ambrosio, a member of the CLN (Committee for National Liberation), had set up.\n\nContributions and Communist Party activism \nClaudia joined the clandestine Communist Party of Naples. She surrounded herself with like minded young people, joining a group of artists, writers, and journalists, great architects, painters, sculptors, poets, and art critics who inspired one another through meetings to encourage passion and creativity, harbingers of new culture, and planning. Above all, the group pushed one another to never give up hope on fighting for the cause. Her peers played an important role as a source of training and cultural enrichment. Many of these great minds would become close friends of Claudia’s that stuck by her throughout her lifetime, as they met throughout the Resistance and continued to inspire each other. In 1953, Claudia went as part of a delegation to visit Picasso, to convince him, which she did successfully, to grant the first major exhibition of his work held in Milan. Claudia accepted the incredibly risky tasks of underground press distribution and the delivery of weapons to the partisans of Valdossola. She was a great risk taker and extremely proactive in the Resistance, acting fearlessly by distributing underground press materials, passing messages by bicycle, delivering weapons, and stealing valuable anti-fascist intelligence from the Prison of San Vittore.\n\nPost-fascist regime \nAfter the fascist regime ended in Italy on April 25, 1947, the resistance declared a long-awaited victory, while Claudia and friends entered Milan’s newsroom to memorialize the liberation of the major media.  Claudia knew Vittorini well, became a friend of Alfonso Gatto, and with them she occupied the editorial office of Corriere della Sera on April 25, to bring out the first issue of the no longer fascist newspaper. \"The last political mission,\" Claudia said, \"I made it in '53. When we went to Picasso's Cote d'Azur with D'Ambrosio and Reale, to convince him to lend Guernica to Milan for the exhibition they were dedicating to him in the Palazzo Reale. At a certain moment, Jean Cocteau also arrived. It was a wonderful day\"\nThis brand new, “free” edition of the Evening Courier was published that same day.\nThe main ideals of the Resistance were the conquest of liberty, the defeat of the fascists, and the expulsion of the Germans, which were achieved. With liberation and victory assured, Claudia continued her clinical schooling, concentrating on psychoanalytic treatment in children and neuropsychiatry, as she completed her thesis entitled “The Technique of Psychoanalytic Treatment in Childhood”(1949). Soon after, she met Professor Bruno Noll, who later became her husband. Afterwards, Claudia enrolled at the University of Pavia, with a specialty in Neuropsychiatry, then finishing her course of study in 1952. Claudia expressed wanting to make her contribution towards the renewal of society, as she engaged exclusively in the Public Institutions of Health. Working as a Consultant Neurologist in Milan, she worked her way up in neurology for 33 years, earning the title of Chief Neurologist at the hospital Passirana Rho in Milan.\n\nLater academic accomplishments \nClaudia became notable for her work with children, as she formulated and encouraged the revolutionary opinion that children with mental or neurological disorders could be integrated effectively into normal schools. In a 2016 interview, Claudia reflected on her experiences with children during that time. “In the clinic I was alone with the child and his relatives (even the nurse came out), I took off the white coat (always a source of fright), placed on the carpet a large box of toys and watched the child choose and play. Then I visited. Often such children were sent to ‘special schools’, which only enrolled patients with neurological or mental disorders. These were not appropriate schools for children who had an educational or cultural problem! We undertook great fights with some school principals to get the \"non-pathological\" children integrated into normal schools, yet we obtained excellent results.” Upon her retirement in 1987, Claudia was awarded the title of “Emeritus Chief of Neurology,” and continued her work at the hospital as a volunteer for ten years. She continuously stated her belief that the profession was to be a “service” to the community.\n\nEnd of life contributions and activism \nClaudia felt a personal commitment to serve her community, forever grateful for the opportunities afforded her and humbled by the experience of living under fascism. In 1988, Claudia and her friend Anna Mancini organized a non-profit known as the “Treviso Advar Foundation,” providing at-home care for terminally ill cancer patients, alongside nursing and medical teams, in addition to training of volunteers. The organization created a warm and welcoming “hospice” house with cultural activities for everyone, including the patients. Claudia knew how it felt to be oppressed and to lack freedom, hence why she continued her activism throughout generations. When asked, late in her life, about her role as a freedom fighter, she said, “I know very well what it means not to have freedom (of opinion, of the press, of religion, of movement, etc.), to conquer it and to respect it. It is different for the new generations, who often confuse freedom with license. It is up to adults, even the media, to educate!” Her life was truly one of great sacrifice, risk, determination, love, and kindness. \nClaudia Ruggerini passed away peacefully from natural causes in Rome, Italy, on June 4, 2016.\n\nReferences \n\n1922 births\n2016 deaths\nItalian resistance movement members\nItalian anti-fascists\nItalian psychiatrists\nFemale anti-fascists", "machine_abstract": "Claudia Ruggerini (born in Milan, Italy on September 16, 1974) is the Italian singer-songwriter and musician who has released four albums to date under her own name as well as two more records featuring other artists such as Massimo Ranieri or Alessandro Safina.\nShe was born into a family of musicians; she started singing at age five when she joined her father's band.

{"id": "Duke Nukem (character)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke%20Nukem%20%28character%29", "title": "Duke Nukem (character)", "text": "Duke Nukem is a fictional character and protagonist of the Duke Nukem series of video games. The character first appeared in the 1991 video game Duke Nukem, developed by Apogee Software. He has since starred in multiple sequels developed by 3D Realms. Most recently, he starred in Duke Nukem Forever, released by Gearbox Software, which now owns the rights and intellectual property.\n\nThe character was created by Todd Replogle, George Broussard, and Scott Miller of Apogee Software. Duke Nukem was redesigned as the present tough guy incarnation by George Broussard and Allen Blum for the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D. A sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, was released in 2011, after remaining in development since 1997.\n\nPersonality and appearance\nIn the original game, Duke Nukem barely spoke and was portrayed as a disgruntled TV viewer hired by the CIA to save Earth from the mad scientist Dr. Proton, whom he took offense to for interrupting his soap opera. In the second game, he began to evolve into a more traditional action hero, but remained mostly silent. Since the third game, Duke's personality has been that of a confident, aggressive, politically incorrect, wise-cracking, hyper-masculine person. Although not superhuman, Duke manages to achieve incredible physical feats of violence and conquest through sheer machismo and expertise with automatic firearms. In Duke Nukem Forever, his massive ego is somehow capable of functioning like a shield from physical damage.\n\nHis missions generally involve killing aliens that have invaded Earth. He is apparently sexually adept and irresistible to females, and circumstances often find him surrounded by many buxom women. However, he frequently mentions an estranged love interest named \"Lani\", and she becomes the basis for many of his jokes. This is widely believed to be a reference to Lani Minella, a voice actress who did several voices for Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nDuke Nukem's current character is a pastiche of a number of Hollywood action heroes, including Dirty Harry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and John Wayne. Many of his lines are taken from the movie Army of Darkness, and his most famous line is from the movie They Live with Roddy Piper saying, \"I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum.\" Duke's appearance resembles that of The Boz as well as characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Voiced by Jon St. John since the third game, Duke's voice is based on that of Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry.\n\nDuke is best known for his trademark jet pack, his golden IMI Desert Eagle pistol or golden Colt M1911, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, which completely conceal his eyes and which he has been seen wearing even at night since Duke Nukem 3D. His other trademark is a blond military-style flattop haircut which has existed since the first game, and the radioactive trefoil symbol, which is found on his belt-buckle, the side of his signature pistol, and numerous other locations throughout the games.  He usually wears a red tank top (pink in the first game), military tactical harness, blue jeans and black army boots - in some of the games, Duke executes a maneuver known as the \"Mighty Boot,\" which is simply a strong front kick. He is also notable for constantly smoking a cigar.\n\nIn Duke Nukem II, Duke wrote an autobiography titled Why I'm So Great which he later autographed in Duke Nukem Forever. In Duke Nukem Forever, he's achieved immense fame and fortune since saving the Earth, now owning a casino on the Las Vegas Strip called The Ladykiller, in which the Damn! ... It's Late Show (hosted by Johnny O'Lenoman) is taped, and the Museum of Duke is housed, as well as a burger restaurant chain called Duke Burger. He is also linked to the EDF (Earth Defense Forces), answering to General Graves. In a news conference held at the end of Duke Nukem Forever, he announces his intention of running for president, which would make him the 69th U.S. president.\n\nAccording to the stats provided by the Duke Nukem Character Memory Card, he is 6'4\" (1,93 m) and at a body fat percentage of 8%, weighs 240 lbs. (109 kg).\n\nAppearances\nDuke Nukem was initially created in 1987 by chief programmer Todd Replogle of Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) as the protagonist for the video game he was designing titled Metal Future, which was set in the then-near future of \"one decade later from now\" in 1997. After hearing the character's name, producer and founder of Apogee, Scott Miller, suggested the game should have the same name, and he helped design the character. Artwork was produced by George Broussard, Allen H. Blum III, and Jim Norwood. Duke was not voiced, but spoke through on-screen text.\n\nIn the sequel, Duke Nukem II, which was released two years later, the same mostly-silent incarnation of the character was used, although he was now an American hero. Duke Nukem II features an intro with one line, spoken by Joe Siegler (\"I'm back\"), and a death scream by character co-creator Todd Replogle.\n\nFor Duke Nukem 3D, the character of Duke Nukem was dramatically redesigned by George Broussard and Allen Blum as the more familiar macho, wise-cracking character of today. Duke Nukem 3D was one of the most controversial games at the time due to its strong violence, cultural stereotypes, strong language, and sexual content. Duke Nukem 3D, as well as the dozen or so subsequent Duke Nukem games, feature Jon St. John as the voice of Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem 3D was the first game in which the character has a significant speaking role.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that John Cena will star in a Duke Nukem movie for Paramount Pictures & Platinum Dunes. However, in January 2019, Duke Nukem voice actor Jon St. John stated that no movie was in development. In a press statement announcing Embracer Group's acquisition of Gearbox Software, however, production of the film was reconfirmed.\n\nGames with Duke Nukem as a protagonist\n Duke Nukem (temporarily \"Duke Nukum\") – 1991 – MS-DOS\n Duke Nukem II – 1993 – MS-DOS, iPhone/iPod Touch, iPad\n Duke Nukem 3D – 1996 – MS-DOS, Mac OS, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive, Game.com, Xbox Live Arcade, iPhone/iPod Touch, Nokia N900, Source ports, Android, iPad\n Duke Nukem 64 – 1997 – Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown – 1997 – PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Time to Kill – 1998 – PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Zero Hour – 1998 – Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem – 1999 – Game Boy Color\n Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes (temporarily \"Planet of the Babes\") – 2000 – PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project – 2002 – Microsoft Windows, Xbox Live Arcade\n Duke Nukem Advance – 2002 – Game Boy Advance\n Duke Nukem Mobile – 2004 – Tapwave Zodiac\n Duke Nukem Mobile - 2004 - Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project – 2005 – Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile 3D – 2005 – Cellular phones (updated port of the original Zodiac version with enhanced graphics)\n Duke Nukem Arena - 2007 - Cellular phones (updated port of Duke Nukem Mobile 3D that included an arena-style multiplayer)\n Duke Nukem: Critical Mass – 2011 - Nintendo DS\n Duke Nukem Forever – 2011 – Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\n Duke Nukem 3D: World Tour – 2016 – Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch\n\nOther appearances\n Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure - 1992 - MS-DOS\n Death Rally - 1996 - MS-DOS\n Balls of Steel - 1997 - Microsoft Windows\n Blood - 1997 - MS-DOS\n Serious Sam 2 - 2005 - Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox\n Death Rally - 2011 - Microsoft Windows, iOS\n Choplifter HD - 2012 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition - 2017 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n Rad Rodgers: Radical Edition - 2018 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\n Wild Buster: Heroes of Titan - 2018 - Microsoft Windows\n Ready Player One - 2018 - Film\n Duke Nukem - TBA - Film\n\nReception\nDuke Nukem has been listed on many \"Best Characters\" and \"Best Heroes\" lists over the years, including being listed as number one in ScrewAttack's \"Top 10 Coolest Video Game Characters\" list in 2007. Featuring him in the section \"top ten forces of good\" in their 2004 list of top 50 retro game heroes, Retro Gamer called Duke \"the ultimate cheese hero, and a true remnant of 80’s action flicks.\" He was listed at number 27 in the \"Top 50 Video Game Characters\" list by Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2011. GameDaily also ranked him sixth on their list of best anti-heroes in video games. In 2011, Empire ranked him as the 20th greatest video game character, calling him \"one of the best action characters ever devised\" and adding that \"Film might have Schwarzenegger, but Gaming's got Mr Nukem\".\n\nReception of the character by the time of Duke Nukem Forever's release was mostly mixed. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer elaborated on Duke Nukem's decreased relevance since 1996, and added that the character's \"half-hearted digs\" at rival franchises were ill-advised due to the game's datedness. Charles Onyett of IGN likened Duke Nukem's maturity to a \"12-year-old boy with Internet access\" and expressed disappointment in the character's datedness and the missed opportunity on the developers' part to \"[play] with the idea of Duke as an anachronism\". Ryan Winterhalter of 1UP.com noted that Duke Nukem had become \"a caricature of his former self. He's crossed the line from charmingly foul-mouthed to obnoxious and embarrassing.\" Cian Hassett of PALGN was more positive about the character, finding him to be \"genuinely hilarious\" due to his tongue-in-cheek rejection of video game traditions (such as finding a key to open a door or wearing a special suit of armor).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAction-adventure game characters\nDuke Nukem\nFictional alcohol abusers\nFictional American people in video games\nFictional cannabis users\nFictional characters from California\nFictional gamblers\nFictional super soldiers\nFictional mercenaries in video games\nFictional smokers\nFirst-person shooter characters\nMale characters in video games\nVideo game characters introduced in 1991\nVideo game characters with accelerated healing\nVideo game mascots\nVideo game protagonists", "machine_abstract": "Duke Nukem: The World's Greatest Athlete Duke Nukem is the protagonist of several video games, including first-person shooter and platformer titles developed by 3D Realms and published under their own label as well as other publishers such as Interplay Entertainment Group Inc., Sierra Entertainment Corporation, Take-Two Interactive Software, Apogee Software International Ltd.

{"id": "Oath of Pontida", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath%20of%20Pontida", "title": "Oath of Pontida", "text": "The oath of Pontida (Giurament de Pontida in Lombard, Giuramento di Pontida in Italian), according to tradition, would have been a ceremony that would have sanctioned on 7 April 1167, in the abbey of Pontida, near Bergamo, in Italy, the birth of the Lombard League, or of a military alliance between the municipalities of Milan, Lodi, Ferrara, Piacenza and Parma aimed at the armed struggle against the Holy Roman Empire by Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nThe oath of Pontida does not appear on contemporary documents, being mentioned for the first time in 1505, then three and a half centuries after the traditional date of 7 April 1167.\n\nHistory\n\nContemporary sources\n\nThe event is questioned by historians, given that in the contemporary chronicles written between 1152 and 1189, no Pontida oath is cited. Its first mention is in fact late, since it appears on a document dated 1505.\n\nHowever, contemporary sources cite the fact that the municipalities of the Lombard League had signed pacts to counter Barbarossa's hegemony by helping each other. Most of these writings, however, argue the event in a rather vague way, without describing the details: neither the locations nor the precise dates of the signing of the pacts are mentioned. On the Piacentina chronicle, regarding the agreement reached for the rebuilding of Milan, we can read:\n\nThe most precise contemporary historical sources tell of at least three oaths among the municipalities of the Lombard League: the first, signed between the end of February and the beginning of March 1167 between Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Mantua and known as the \"Bergamo oath \"; the second, also signed by Milan in March 1167, which joined the four cities in the just mentioned oath; the third, also signed by Lodi in May of the same year, which became part of the previously mentioned coalition, formed by Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Mantua and Milan.\n\nConsidering the date of 7 April 1167, we can therefore state that the oath of Pontida, even if it was actually signed, was not the constitution of the Lombard League, since at least two previous oaths are cited on historical documents.\n\nThe following documents\n\nIn addition to the chronological aspect, which would seem to demonstrate the non-existence of the oath of Pontida as a constitutive pact of the Lombard League due to the two agreements signed before 7 April 1167, the first mention of the incident must certainly also be considered which is quite posterior.\n\nIn particular, the oath of Pontida appears for the first time on a document dated 1505 by Bernardino Corio - therefore about 350 years after the canonical date of 7 April 1167 - which is called Historia Patria and which has as its subject the history of Milan.\n\nThen all the subsequent documents referring to the oath of Pontida were inspired by the Historia Patria by Bernardino Corio. In an excerpt from the code of 1584 Successores S. Barnabae Apostoli in Ecclesia Mediolanensi, which refers to a note on the archbishop of Milan Umberto Pirovano, it is reported that:\n\nIn Archiepiscoporum Mediolanensium series historico-chronologica, which was compiled by Giuseppe Antonio Sassi in 1755 and which is linked to the aforementioned text of 1584, it can instead be read:\n\nHypothesis on a possible oath of Pontida\nHowever, it is possible that there were other agreements signed by the municipalities of the Lombard League of which the documented trace was then lost. In fact, over the centuries, there are many examples in which several meetings were needed to write down all the aspects of a bargaining: in other words, in history, it has been difficult to define in detail a pact or an alliance in few sessions.\n\nAs far as Pontida is concerned, we must also observe its close link with Milan: the municipality near Bergamo belonged to the archdiocese of Milan although it was understood, from a geographical point of view, in the county of Bergamo.\n\nIt is therefore not excluded that there was also an oath at Pontida, whose references to contemporary documentation were then lost.\n\nCommemorations\nEvery year at Pontida, in the month of June, in the Giuramento square, the historical phases that led to the birth of the military pact signed, according to tradition, on 7 April 1167 are recalled by about one hundred people in costume. On the occasion of the re-enactment, recreational and cultural events are also organized.\n\nSince 1990, the autonomous political party of the Lega Nord has annually organized a meeting at Pontida that celebrates the eponymous medieval oath. During the event the most important political exponents of the party intervene.\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1167 in Europe\n12th century in Italy\n1160s in the Holy Roman Empire\nHistory of Lombardy\nOaths", "machine_abstract": "The oath was taken by the Estonian Supreme Court on September 16, 1994 in front of President Lennart Meri and Prime Minister Mart Laar at the Presidential Palace in Tallinn.\nOn October 1, 1994 Estonia adopted its first constitution which entered into force on December 31, 1994 after it had been ratified by both houses of parliament (the Riigikogu and Eesti Landsting) as well as popularly approved through referendum held November 24–25, 1994.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Oath of Pontida\".

It measured 5.1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area. With moderate damage in the Wabash River Valley, it is currently the strongest earthquake recorded in the U.S. state of Indiana. The earthquake occurred somewhere along a fault within the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone.\n\nDamage\nThe earthquake was felt over an area of 30,000 square miles. In Terre Haute, the earthquake toppled two chimneys, cracked plaster, and knocked pictures from walls. Nearby Covington, north of Terre Haute in Fountain County, experienced several fallen chimneys and some broken windows. Chimneys were \"jarred loose\" in Princeton, Indiana, and one chimney was even \"shaken to pieces\" at Olivette, Missouri (a suburb of St. Louis). A brick wall was also \"shook\" down within St. Louis, Missouri. Reports came from various states, including Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.\n\nSee also \n 1947 Wisconsin earthquake\n List of earthquakes in 1909\n List of earthquakes in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n1909 earthquakes\n1909 Wabash River\n1909 Wabash River\n1909 in Indiana\n1909 in Missouri\n1909 natural disasters in the United States\nSeptember 1909 events", "machine_abstract": "The 1909 Wabash River earthquake was the most significant seismic event to strike southwestern Indiana in recorded history, and one of only two earthquakes that have been felt as far north as Chicago (the other being the 1811–1812 New Madrid Seismic Zone).

{"id": "KYKR", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYKR", "title": "KYKR", "text": "KYKR (95.1 FM, \"Kicker 95.1\") is a radio station broadcasting a Country format.  Licensed to Beaumont, Texas, it serves the Beaumont/Port Arthur metropolitan area, owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.  The \"Kicker\" branding and country format were first broadcast on 93.3 FM (now KQBU-FM) under the current call sign in 1980, owned and operated by Steve Hicks.  Its studios are located southeast of the I-10/US 69 interchange in Beaumont, and its transmitter is located in Vidor, Texas.\n\nHistory\nThe FCC allocated 95.1 facility in Beaumont received an initial License to Cover on November 27, 1961 as KHGM, owned by Gerald Proctor under the entity of Woodland Broadcasting Company. The facility is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.\n\nFor many years, KYKR was located at 93.3 FM, which had first begun as KCAW-FM, the FM companion to 1510 KCAW Port Arthur and owned by Jimmie Joynt. Jimmie sold the station when he moved to Dallas to start Superior Broadcast Products. The KYKR call was issued to 93.3 in 1980 and was owned by the Hicks family of Beaumont (Steve Hicks most notably of CapStar; his father, John Hicks, had owned 560 KLVI since the 1960s) and was moved to the 2000 ft. tower in Devers in 1991 after Steve Hicks had purchased this facility. 93.3 was then sold to Tichenor Media, now Univision, resulting in the KYKR calls and format being permanently moved to this frequency.\n\nThis was possible as a result of then Top 40/CHR station \"B95\" KZZB going silent at 7 p.m. on November 26, 1991, prompting Gulfstar to purchase the 95.1 signal and ultimately place KYKR's country format on it, and then selling 93.3 to Tichenor Media, which began targeting Houston with the new signal that had just been rebuilt in Devers. 93.3 and 95.1 simulcasts briefly before the latter frequency became KYKR's full-time home in the summer of 1992.\n\nKYKR achieved some of its greatest ratings and revenue success from 1999 to 2009 under the direction of program director Mickey Ashworth.  During this decade, the lineup included Big D & Bubba in the mornings, Mickey Ashworth mid-days, Jim King of the Road afternoons, and Lia nights.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nKicker 95.1 Website\n\nCountry radio stations in the United States\nYKR\nRadio stations established in 1991\n1991 establishments in Texas\nIHeartMedia radio stations", "machine_abstract": "Kyoto Broadcasting System Co., Ltd.

{"id": "Clientitis", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientitis", "title": "Clientitis", "text": "Clientitis (also called clientism or localitis) is the alleged tendency of resident in-country staff of an organization to regard the officials and people of the host country as \"clients\".\n\nOverview\nThis condition can be found in business, military, or government.  The term clientitis is somewhat similar to the phrases \"gone native\" or \"going native\", and may have its origins in the 19th Century when small diplomatic missions were staffed by long-term expatriates with distant connections to their home country.  20th and 21st Century rapid communication with home ministries, and frequent rotations of staff, make the term anachronistic and less relevant in modern diplomatic context.\n\nA hypothetical example of clientitis would be a Foreign Service Officer (FSO) or foreign diplomat, serving overseas at an Embassy, who drifts into a mode of rationalizing and defending the actions of the host country government.  In such an example, the officer has come to view the officials and government workers of the host country government as the persons he is serving.  Former USUN Ambassador John Bolton has used this term disparagingly to describe the culture of the U.S. State Department, but the available public record shows little genuine evidence of modern diplomatic clientitis.\n\nAn example from business would be a representative for a company living in another nation, representing that company to the host nation and other institutions in that country.  A business representative suffering clientitis would defend the host country government and operating environment as if those were his employers.  A military example would be a defense attaché who identifies reflexively with the host country's military establishment.\n\nWithin the U.S. State Department\nThe State Department's training for newly appointed ambassadors warns of the danger of clientitis,  and the Department rotates FSOs every 2–3 years to avoid it. During the Nixon administration the State Department's Global Outlook Program (GLOP) attempted to combat clientitis by transferring FSOs to regions outside their area of specialization.\n\nRobert D. Kaplan alleges that the problem \"became particularly prevalent\" among American diplomats in the Middle East because the investment of time needed to learn Arabic and the large number of diplomatic postings where it was spoken meant diplomats could spend their entire career in a single region.\n\nAnthony Lake argues that while clientitis is a danger, reflexive accusations of it can deter Foreign Service Officers from providing accurate analysis to policymakers.  In modern practice, with tight control from Washington or any other home office, and narrow advancement paths requiring deference to career interests, clientitis (as much as appeasement) is an obsolete label for diplomacy, and use of the stereotype may reflect an anti-elitist or unilateralist agenda.  In contrast, caustic and realism-based diplomats' analyses, including recently those of former UK Ambassador Kim Darroch and former U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul, demonstrate diplomats' main purpose in providing unvarnished opinion, at risk of angering the host government.\n\nIn the 1990s the phenomenon was seen within the State Department as being particularly acute in El Salvador, reflecting \"both the polarization of the country and the highly ideological position of the United States within that polarization.\"\n\nRevelations about U.S. diplomatic cables however show how \"U.S. ambassadors really felt about their host governments and gave an unvarnished view of the inner workings of American diplomacy. [And] sparked diplomatic firestorms across the world that left the State Department reeling.\"  Rather than identifying with host countries, modern diplomats compete with a range of open media and news sources to gain the attention and favor of their home offices, resulting in sharp, opinionated reporting identifying the national interests at stake, potential advantages to be gained, and sometimes writing attention-getting travelogues of local cultural conditions.\n\nIn \"To The Secretary,\" former diplomat Mary Thompson-Jones \"describes several types of cables: official updates, scene setters, biographical profiles, spot reports, daily media reaction and situation reports. “Knowing by instinct when and what to communicate back home is what makes a good diplomat,” she writes. “Their reporting must walk a line between loyally carrying out assignments from Washington, while making essential, sometimes contradictory, points to a foreign policy establishment that does not always want to hear them.”\n\nSee also\nOikophobia\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States Department of State\nForeign relations of the United States\nDiplomacy", "machine_abstract": "The term clientitis is used to describe the tendency of some people in business relationships, especially those who are paid by commission or other forms of incentive-based compensation (such as salespeople), to act primarily on behalf of their own interests rather than that of the organization they represent.\nIn this context it refers specifically to:", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Clientitis\".

{"id": "The Mother/Child Papers", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Mother/Child%20Papers", "title": "The Mother/Child Papers", "text": "The Mother/Child Papers is Alicia Ostriker’s fourth book of poetry.  It was originally published by Momentum Press in 1980 and was re-published in 1986 and 2009.  The book is divided into four sections, and draws inspiration from the events of the Vietnam War era and Ostriker's personal experiences with motherhood.  In the work, Ostriker juxtaposes meditations on war against musings of motherhood and the experience of birth.  The many verses and prose pieces that comprise the book contrasts a woman's roles as teacher, mother, and wife, with the violence, corruption, and death of war.\n\nBackground\nOstriker began composing The Mother/Child Papers after the birth of her son, a few days following the shooting of four students at Kent State. In the work, Ostriker chronicles her fears of bringing a son into the brutal modern world with so many expectations and pre-constructed notions of what makes a great man, especially during wartime.  The title of the work similarly emphasizes its historic position by echoing The Pentagon Papers.  The Mother/Child Papers explores such topics as women's strengths, the joys and frustration of parenthood, shock and outrage over war, and the destruction of the natural environment, and challenges typical notions of mother-child relationships, female experience, and sexual perceptions of women.\n\nSummary\n\nI: Cambodia \nThe books begins with a lengthy prose section in which Ostriker recalls the events of her son, Gabriel's, May 14, 1970 birth and relates it to political developments that occurred around that time, most notably the Kent State Shootings and the beginning of Operation Total Victory, the United States invasion of Cambodia.  The three events are described in tandem, with each intertwined with the others.\n\nOstriker then tells of the births of her two older daughters.  One was delivered in a progressive Wisconsin hospital and another by midwife in England.  Ostriker says that these two experiences shaped her expectation of what childbirth should be like: “a woman gives birth to a child, and the medical folk assist her.”\n\nOstriker then speaks of the birth of her third child, Gabriel, at a southern California traditional hospital.  Despite having reached an agreement with her doctor about what drugs she was to be given during the procedure, while in the early stages of labor Ostriker inadvertently consented to being injected with Demerol, a sedative, thinking it was a local analgesic.  Under the effects of the Demerol, Ostriker then consented to receive a spinal anesthetic, which left her unable to feel anything from the waist down.  Upon waking, Ostriker was furious about being deprived of the experience of natural childbirth and relates the invasion of her body by the medical professionals who delivered the child to the US invasion of Cambodia.\n\nII: Mother/Child \nThe second section of the book is a series of related, untitled stream-of-consciousness poems alternating between the new mother and the child's perspective.  In these sections, Ostriker explores the intimate, even erotic, relationship between a mother and her infant child.   She expresses the different emotions she experienced towards the child during this time, from blissful admiration and boundless optimism, to bitter resentment and a wish that the “leech” would “die”.\n\nThere are also a number of short prose sections in which Ostriker relates the events of the Kent State shooting and the immediate aftermath of Gabriel's birth.  References to war and devastation pervade both accounts; as Ostriker muses on the beauty of her child, she suddenly thinks of “babies stabbed in their little bellies / and hoisted up to the sky on bayonets”.  The section ends with two titled pieces: “Paragraphs,” a prose piece in which Ostriker examines the range of emotions new mothers feel towards their infants, ranging from almost divine love to murderous rage, and “Mother/Child: A Coda,” in which she dispenses advice about life and consciousness to her child, alerting him to its savage, brutal nature, as well as its potential for transcendent beauty.\n\nIII: The Spaces \nThe third part of the book is the longest and is composed of a series of 16 titled prose and poetry pieces exploring life with the new child and its effects on the family.  In “Letter to M.” the speaker discusses the erotic pleasure inherent in nursing a child and ponders why this is never discussed in any parenting material.  The poem “Song of the Abandoned One” is written from the perspective of the infant's jealous and angry older sibling, begging her parents to “Kill the baby”.  Ostriker recounts an experience with her family listening to a production of Shakespeare’s Macbeth on the radio in “Macbeth and the Kids In the Cabin at Chester.”  In “Things to Remember of Eve,” Ostriker describes her daughter, Eve Ostriker, at two different stages in her life, at ages 8 and 21. In “In the Autumn of My Thirty-Seventh Birthday,” Ostriker describes the sense of emptiness and depression she experienced dealing with family life, recounting also a discussion with a depressed friend, N., who refuses to take the antidepressants her psychiatrist prescribed her.  In “Exile,” Ostriker considers the contrasting powers of love and violence, wondering when her son will grow to the point where “he will turn away” from his mother's kisses “not to waste breath.”  The poem's post-script reads, “during the evacuation of Phnom Penh, 1975.”  \n\nIn the section's titular prose piece, “The Spaces,” Ostriker recalls an ideal “windy, snowy January evening” at home with her children.  Throughout the poem, there are a number of allusions to William Blake’s Songs of Innocence, as well as a repeated lamb motif.  Ostriker’s perfect winter day with her children is contrasted with her husband’s discussion about entropy and the ultimate heat death of the universe.\n\nThe next poem, “Propaganda Poem: Maybe For Some Young Mamas” is divided into three parts.  In the first part, “The Visiting Poet,” Ostriker recounts an experience she once had giving a guest lecture to a class of feminist college students.  She read the class a poem about pregnancy and was shocked when the class reacted with revulsion to the notion of motherhood.  Ostriker tries to explain that motherhood is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences possible for a woman to experience and that the class has been thoroughly brainwashed against it through patriarchal messages.  In part two, “Postscript to Propaganda,” Ostriker acknowledges that raising children is an incredibly difficult and demanding experience which wears a mother down, but she concludes the poem by asking the audience, “Come on, you daughters of bitches, do you want to live forever?”  The poem's last part, “What Actually,” indicts the “ideological lockstep” that Ostriker claims dictates women's feelings on motherhood.  She goes on to explain that she believes that certain women are born to be mothers, while others simply were not.  She concludes by once more acknowledging that although raising children wears away at a person, so does anything enjoyable in life, and that those who refuse to do anything dangerous are “already dead.”\n\nIn “The Leaf Pile,” Ostriker recounts the events of an October day when, upon catching her son trying to put something dirty in his mouth, she slapped him.  The poem explores the workings of memory and how such events can be easily forgotten by the child but remain a vivid mark of shame for the parent.  The next work is a prose piece titled “The Seven Samurai, The Dolly, and Mary Cassatt.”  Ostriker remembers an evening watching Akira Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, trying to compare it to other masculine art works in an attempt to come to a better understanding of the male perspective.  She is interrupted by her children coming to her asking for attention and assistance.  She recalls a quote by W.B. Yeats about how one must choose between the perfection of one’s craft and one's life before going to help her daughter with her report on Mary Cassatt.  The next poem, “The Change” explores the relationship between animate and inanimate things how it parallels the distant relationship Ostriker's daughter maintains with her as they drive to her horseback riding lessons.  In “One, To Fly,” Ostriker examines the transformation of her son Gabriel as he grows up.  In nursery school, he tells her that his three wishes are to be able to fly, to be able to talk to animals, and for there to be no more war.  The poem's last stanza reveals that at age 9, Gabriel has largely lost his pacifist nature due to bullying and social pressures and now fights children who bully him.  “In the Dust,” the section's penultimate poem, deals with the development of Ostriker's daughter and examines the mother's own role in helping mold her daughter into an acceptable woman in society's eyes, even if that role has made the mother personally unhappy.  In the last poem of the section, “His Speed and Strength,” Ostriker meditates on seeing her son at play, overtaking her on his bicycle, using his strength for a purely creative purpose.  She also sees a group of black and white children playing together without any tension and thinks to herself that maybe “it is not necessary to make hate.”\n\nIV: This Power \nThe book's last section is composed of three poems, “One Marries,” “This Power,” and “Dream.”  “One Marries” begins with a quote from Percy Shelley’s Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, “To fear himself, and love all human kind.”  In this poem, Ostriker meditates upon the dynamics of marriage, comparing its necessity for balance to the crude, simple domination of Imperialism.  In “This Power,” Ostriker considers the respect and attraction children feel towards their mothers, even in the most degrading and trying circumstances.  “Dream,” the book's last poem is very brief and describes“a woman / oliveskinned like an Indian / brownhaired like a European” “giving birth / comfortabl[y]” for days on end.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Mother/Child Papers enjoyed fairly favorable reception upon its release.  The Iowa Review said, “It is startling to read the early pages of this book: where, before this, was the literature of squalid bliss and righteous woe of taking care of an infant? It is alive in Ostriker . . . one of the most intelligent and lyrical of American poets.”  The American Poetry Review said, “Ostriker's work details the achievement of a connection between personal history and public fact as both present themselves to a very intelligent writer . . . Nothing in the novels of Margaret Drabble is as affecting, as convincing, as a few lines of Ostriker's.” \n\nIn the years after the initial release of The Mother/Child Papers, it has come to be regarded as an extremely influential book in feminist circles.  Upon its 2009 republishing, poet Eleanor Wilner remarked, “So many women shed shame and took heart from The Mother/Child Papers, which feels as fresh and necessary as ever- feminism without dogma, motherhood without sanctimony, the power of the pen dipped in blood: this time not of battle but of birth. Rejoicing at its return, I recall how far this book-awakening us to all that had been left out of literature-was ahead of the curve: gravity's rainbow, the trajectory of a culture's once heaven-bound imagination, headed back to Earth.”\n\nReferences\n\n1980 poetry books\nAmerican poetry collections", "machine_abstract": "The papers of the American writer and activist Margaret Mead are held by the University Archives at Columbia University in New York City, United States.

There are no settlements near to the lake itself although there are small communities nearby such as Los Antiguos.   Accessible from this town via unpaved roads or dirt tracks, the lake can be reached within three hours walking time along well-marked trails.   A boat trip across the lake takes approximately one hour.", "prompt": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"{title}\".

He represented Matagorda Municipality in the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos where he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence.  President Sam Houston nominated Fisher as Secretary of the Texas Navy and the appointment was confirmed by the Senate on October 28, 1836.\n\nA letter to presidential candidate Mirabeau B. Lamar in August 1838 from George Wheelwright urged reconsideration of Fisher for Secretary for the good of the navy and defense of the Republic and Houston suspended Fisher from office in October 1837, to secure \"harmony and efficiency\".  Many in the senate opposed the move and the Senate ordered Fisher's reinstatement on October 18, 1837. This event was a major incident in the early days of the Republic of Texas and added to the severe split between the various factions in the government.\n\nSam Houston Dixon in \"The Men Who Made Texas Free\" wrote that \"when Mr. Fisher died, Richard Ellis, who was president of the convention which declared Texas independent of Mexico, said from the floor of the Senate:  'In the death of Rhodes Fisher the Republic has lost one of its wisest defenders. He was a man of poise even midst times of stress and excitement. Well do some of us remember his cool and deliberate consideration of our acts at Old Washington, March, 1836; how his voice of caution rang out as men of zeal vied with one another in their precipitous rush to complete their labors of establishing a government and returning to their homes. So earnestly did he plead and so logical was his appeal that we were persuaded to follow his advice........There was nothing of the braggadocio about him and he did not lack courage to express his opinions.'\"\n\nFisher died on March 14, 1839, and was buried at Matagorda.

{"id": "Rosemont College", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemont%20College", "title": "Rosemont College", "text": "Rosemont College is a private Catholic liberal arts college in Rosemont, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1921 as a women's college by the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, the undergraduate program opened to male students beginning in fall 2009. Rosemont is a member of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education (SEPCHE) and \nis accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). Rosemont also offers a range of master's degrees through its School of Graduate Studies and School of Professional Studies.\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1921 by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, Rosemont College is an independent liberal arts institution in the Catholic tradition located in eastern Pennsylvania. In the fall of 2009, the traditionally women's undergraduate college began accepting male students.\n\nThe traditional Undergraduate College confers B.A., B.S., and B.F.A. degrees in twenty-four majors. Rosemont College also includes the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies offering degrees and certificates at the master's level.\n\nOne of the oldest Catholic women's colleges in the region, Rosemont originally \"had a reputation for educating the daughters of more well-to-do Catholics.\"\n\nRosemont's first chairman of the board was Cardinal Dougherty, who was instrumental in gaining Rosemont its first accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools by personally guaranteeing the college's financial solvency.\n\nBishop Fulton J. Sheen was likewise involved in the early life of the college, describing Rosemont as \"the finest girls' college in the United States.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Rosemont students aided the war effort by selling war bonds serving as air-raid wardens while the college hosted Villanova College's summer programs as Villanova's campus was in use during the summers by the United States Navy.\n\nHowever, Rosemont evolved over the course of the twentieth century; \"As views on women changed, the original—what some would call convent—atmosphere gradually moved toward more freedom for students to come and go, later curfews, and greater interaction with college men.\"\n\nIn 1963, Rosemont students insisted that the college begin bringing non-Catholic speakers to campus, and by the early 1970s, the college ceased holding religious retreats due to lack of attendance.\n\nCampus\n\nIn 1927, the Sisters of the Holy Child of Jesus acquired the former home of Joseph F. Sinnott, known both as Rathalla and as the Joseph Sinnott Mansion for $1.00 to serve as the school campus.\n\nThe English origins of the Sisters of the Holy Child influenced the campus architecture and layout. Unlike other local Catholic colleges, Rosemont's campus eschewed cloistered buildings and convent motifs in favor of a campus with \"modestly-sized buildings arranged around a gentle rise in the landscape.... Students found it easy to walk to the Rosemont train station or to the shops in nearby Bryn Mawr, which was very different from the relative isolation encountered by students at Chestnut Hill and especially at Immaculata.\"\n\nThe college's Immaculate Conception Chapel is one of only two chapels in the United States whose stained-glass windows depict only women, a project conceived by Rosemont's second president, Mother Mary Ignatius Carroll.\n\nAcademics\nPrograms are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\nUndergraduate College\nThe Undergraduate College offers 24 majors, awarding Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Science degrees. Each program offers an in-depth study of a particular subject area, as well as a breadth of study in the liberal arts. Rosemont's majors are:\n\nRosemont offers teacher certification programs in elementary education and secondary education, as well as pre-professional programs in dentistry, optometry, veterinary science, medicine, and law.\n\nRosemont College has developed inter-institutional cooperative agreements with Villanova University, Eastern University, Arcadia University, Cabrini College, Chestnut Hill College, Gwynedd Mercy University, Holy Family University, Immaculata University, and Neumann University. These agreements allow for cross-registration and the sharing of library resources between the institutions.\n\nRosemont also offers study abroad programs, internships, individualized majors, an early assurance medical program and other Nursing Programs with Drexel University College of Medicine, accelerated BA and MA programs, and the Cornelian Scholars program for early acceptance to Rosemont's graduate programs.\n\nRosemont offers a 7-year BA/BS/MD Fast Track medical program with Drexel University College of Medicine in which students study for 3 years at Rosemont and after passing the required scores on the MCAT, move onto Drexel College of Medicine. The college also offers an 8-year BA/BS/MD Early Assurance medical program.\n\nSchool of Graduate Studies\nRosemont College's School of Graduate Studies offers seven co-educational graduate programs. Its M.F.A. in Creative Writing was listed as an \"M.F.A. Program to Watch\" by Publishers Weekly in 2015.\n\nSchool of Professional Studies\nThe School of Professional Studies offers accelerated degree programs, certificates, and corporate training. The accelerated degree programs are completed in five-week sessions, normally meeting once a week for four hours. The accelerated graduate courses are completed in seven-week sessions or over a weekend.\n\nThe School of Professional Studies offer the following undergraduate and graduate degrees and certifications.\n\nAthletics\nRosemont, known athletically as the Ravens, is a Division III member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and is a charter member of the Colonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC).\n\nMen's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, golf, and volleyball. Rosemont's Athletic Complex is home to a fully gray synthetic turf multi-purpose field, the first all gray field in the United States. The baseball team will play its first season during the college's centennial.\n\nNotable alumnae\nMari Carmen Aponte, United States Ambassador to El Salvador\nVirginia Samaras Bauer, 9/11 survivors activist\nPat Ciarrocchi, news reporter\nMarion Donovan, inventor of the disposable diaper\nLinda Fiorentino, actress\nPatricia Kennedy Lawford, socialite and philanthropist\nPatricia McCormick, journalist and author\nRosalind Russell, actress, winner of five Golden Globes and a Tony Award\nClaudine Schneider, Congressional representative from Rhode Island\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official website\n Official athletics website\n\n \nEducational institutions established in 1921\nLower Merion Township, Pennsylvania\nSociety of the Holy Child Jesus\nUniversities and colleges in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania\nCatholic universities and colleges in Pennsylvania\n1921 establishments in Pennsylvania\nFormer women's universities and colleges in the United States\nAssociation of Catholic Colleges and Universities\nLiberal arts colleges in Pennsylvania", "machine_abstract": "Rosemont College is the largest private, nonprofit college in Illinois and one of the nation's fastest growing colleges.\nFounded by Catholic Diocese of Joliet as St. Mary's Academy (SMA) in 1917 to educate young women who were unable to attend public high schools because they worked during the daytime or lived too far away from school districts that offered secondary education at night.

{"id": "Dun Ringill", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun%20Ringill", "title": "Dun Ringill", "text": "Dun Ringill (Gaelic: Dùn, 'fort', Ringill, 'point of the ravine') is an Iron Age hill fort on the Strathaird peninsula on the island of Skye, Scotland.   Further fortified in the Middle Ages, tradition holds that it was for several centuries the seat of Clan MacKinnon. It is located east of Kirkibost on the west shore of Loch Slapin.\n\nHistory \nThe original structure of Dun Ringill is consistent with an Iron Age Broch dating to approximately the first years of the common era. The main and subordinate structures were occupied and modified throughout its history until the 19th century. Tradition relates that the structure was occupied by the MacKinnons as their clan seat well before the 16th century. It is mentioned in historical texts in the 16th century, after which the MacKinnons moved their seat to Dunakin.<ref name=\"Lochalsh' pp. 39-43\">The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39-43. Miket, R., and Roberts, D. Birlin Limited, 2007, .</ref>\n\n Description \n\nDun Ringill today is a stacked stone ruin overlooking Loch Slapin. The present structure is approximately  in height and  on each side, with a ditch following the outer wall. Its most notable feature is the central landward facing doorway approximately  high that leads into the center of the structure. The interior of the structure contained two rectangular buildings measuring . The original layout was similar to that of a broch, a form of complex Atlantic roundhouse.\n\nA stone wall foundation encloses area adjacent to the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation. A site survey has shown that there are remains of other buildings in the immediate vicinity; and although their age is uncertain, it is likely their construction and occupation was throughout the history of Dun Ringill up until the 19th century.\n\nTo the north and west is a hilly coastal plain. Loch Slapin lies to the east and south of the structure. On either side of the structure are earth and stone ramps that descend down to the ocean. These ramps likely allowed easy access to the water and shipping. Since roads in this part of Skye did not exist until recent times, sea travel was the predominant mode of transportation.\n\n In popular culture \nThe rock band Jethro Tull performed a song entitled \"Dun Ringill\" on their 1979 Stormwatch album.  The lyrics call for a meeting down by Dun Ringill during the wee hours of a stormy night, when \"we'll watch the old gods play.\" The song was written by Tull leader Ian Anderson, who lived at Kilmarie House, within walking distance of Dun Ringill, at the time.\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Scotland Blue Guide, A&C Black, London, 12th Edition, 2001, .\n Scotland an Oxford Archaeological Guide, Oxford University Press, 1998, \n The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39–43.

{"id": "Coffins on Io", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffins%20on%20Io", "title": "Coffins on Io", "text": "Coffins on Io is the seventh studio album by avant-garde band Kayo Dot, released in the UK on August 14, 2014 and in the US on October 13 through experimental metal label The Flenser. It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

{"id": "J.B. Nethercutt", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.B.%20Nethercutt", "title": "J.B. Nethercutt", "text": "Jack Boison Nethercutt (October 11, 1913 – December 6, 2004) was an American entrepreneur and car collector. He was the co-founder of Merle Norman Cosmetics with his aunt Merle Norman, later ascending to the positions of chairman and chief executive officer of the company. He also served as a director of the Personal Care Products Council.\n\nNethercutt used his wealth to assemble one of the world's greatest car collections, which would become known as the Nethercutt Collection. With his cars, he won a record 6 Best of Show titles at the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and is widely considered to the greatest car competitor of all time.\n\nEarly life and education\nNethercutt was born in South Bend, Indiana, United States, to Carl and Florence Nethercutt with two other siblings. At the age of 9, his mother died and he moved to Santa Monica, California in 1923 to live with his aunt, Merle Norman and her husband Andy Norman. He attended Santa Monica High School and later enrolled to study chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. During his time in college, his aunt had created a small local cosmetics business in her home, making formulas out of her own kitchen. He dropped out of college to help her establish the business.\n\nMerle Norman career\nIn 1931, Nethercutt's aunt spent $150 to open a small local cosmetics studio named Merle Norman Cosmetics in downtown Santa Monica to sell their homemade products. Norman created the products and Nethercutt peddled to dealers on his bicycle, picking up disregarded boxes from groceries for packing shipments. By 1934, the company had expanded to 94 independently owned franchises across the contiguous United States, with the majority of them being owned by women. Nethercutt later served as Vice-Chairman of Merle Norman until Norman stepped down in 1963. In 1969, Nethercutt decided to make the previously private family owned enterprise go public on the American Stock Exchange. In 1974, Nethercutt purchased all the public stock back at roughly US$10 million, roughly $55 million adjusted for inflation. Following his purchase, he would again make Merle Norman a privately owned company.\n\nUnder his tenure, Merle Norman was recognized as one of the top 10 largest American cosmetic companies by People magazine. By 1981, Nethercutt spent $5 million on Merle Norman's first nationwide advertising campaign, which had previously only used word-of-mouth marketing. The company also had begun experimentally selling in European markets, specifically Switzerland and Austria, which attained $1 million in the first year. By the end of 1981, Merle Norman as a whole made over US$130 million and had expanded to over 2,700 studios in the US and Canada. In 1993 Nethercutt stepped down as CEO but remained the chairman of the board. In 1999 he directed the refurbishment of all Merle Norman studios in North America for a universal consistent interior design, which was last updated in the late 70s. By 2004, Merle Norman had expanded to eight countries internationally and was consistently in the top 50 of Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500. The company had a revenue of over $100 million and he passed the company down to his son, Jack Nethercutt II.\n\nCosmetic committee positions \nNethercutt served as the President of the California Cosmetics Association. He was on both the board and executive committee of the Personal Care Products Council.\n\nCars\nIn 1956, Nethercutt purchased two cars, a 1936 Duesenberg Convertible Roadster for $5,000 and a 1930 DuPont Town Car for $500, which both needed restoration. He estimated the restoration of the DuPont would take a few weeks, but ended up taking over 18 months and over $65,000. In 1958, his prolonged project to rebuild his DuPont was not in vain and he won Best of Show at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In 1971, Nethercutt purchased a large land lot in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Sylmar. Construction began on a personal 10 story tall building with six floors to house his vehicles and other antique collections, featuring his private penthouse on the top floor. The Nethercutt Collection was built next to a Merle Norman manufacturing plant. \n\nThe first two stories of the tower, the Lower and Grand Salon, feature his vehicle collection of 30 cars on display. The third story features an awards room from concours competitions and collection of hood ornaments. The fourth story consists of a music room with several large antique music boxes and player pianos, with a Wurlitzer theatre organ in the centerpiece of the room. The fourth floor also featured a Louis XV styled dining room with a private chef for his family and friends. The fifth floor has a theatre and a large collection of pianos. The top floor featured his private penthouse. The collection's first four floors are open to the public free of charge with reserved guided tours.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Nethercutt purchased the Twenty Grand, the only 1933 Rollston Arlington Torpedo-bodied Duesenberg SJ and gave it a full original restoration, changing the exterior color from black to a metallic silver and refining the interior. Once the restoration was completed, Nethercutt entered it into Pebble Beach in 1980 and won Best of Show. Because of the car's reputation and beauty, it was exhibited in Essen, Germany as one of The Ten Most Beautiful Cars in the World.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Nethercutt Collection expanded with a 40,000 square foot addition to the tower and a 60,000 square foot new display building directly across the street called the Nethercutt Museum, which is self-guided. Outside of the Museum are his CPR steam locomotive Royal Hudson No. 2839 with a 1912 Pullman private car. By 2004, Nethercutt Collection and Museum included nearly 250 automobiles and led Autoweek to call the Nethercutt Collection one of America's five greatest automobile museums. Jay Leno described Nethercutt's collection as a \"Smithsonian-style effort on the history of transportation in America\" and \"the hall of fame for cars.\" Nethercutt passed the his company and the Collection down to his son Jack with his wife, Helen.\n\nConcours d'Elegance competition\nNethercutt competed in dozens of Concours d'Elegance shows in North America with his cars from the Collection. By 2004, he was one of the most victorious competitors in history and had won several dozen of Best of Show awards, notably including the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance a record six times: 1958, 1959, 1969, 1970, 1980 with The Twenty Grand, and 1992, more than any other individual.\n\nNethercutt is widely considered as one of the greatest car competitors of all time.\n\nPersonal life\n\nNethercutt married his high school sweetheart Dorothy Sykes in 1933. Dorothy was a collector of David Winter sculpted ceramics, including cottages, miniature pianos, and dolls which are featured in the Nethercutt Collection. Their marriage lasted over 70 years and they had two children, Jack and Robert. They later had two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Through Jack and his wife Helen he had three step great-grandchildren, the Richards boys.\n\nEvery year, Nethercutt would take dozens of cars from the Collection with family, friends, and invited guests on a cruise through the hills to a picnic at Frazier Park with catered foods from the professional chefs at the Collection. The event was described as one of the most exclusive items on any car lover's wish list. As Autoweek magazine put it, \"You can be as rich as Bill Gates or have a collection as big as that of the Sultan of Brunei, but you don’t get a personal invitation from J.B. Nethercutt himself.\"\n\nNethercutt loved fishing and was a frequent visitor to the Lake of the Woods near Kenora, Canada. He later purchased a private island on the lake. Nethercutt once diverted his plane to Kenora for a fry feast at Ye Old Chip Truck. In 1985 he donated $1 million to the town for a new emergency department. Later the center and the road connecting it were named in honor after him.\n\nNethercutt was friends with fellow Los Angeles-based car enthusiasts and collectors Jay Leno, Barry Meguiar, and Bruce Meyer.\n\nAircraft \nNethercutt owned several private aircraft through Merle Norman Aviation: a Gulfstream I, Gulfstream II, and a Cessna 206, alongside a small helicopter fleet.\n\nHonors\nThe Nethercutt Emergency Center at the UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica is named after J.B. Nethercutt.\n\nThe J.B. & Dorothy Nethercutt Most Elegant Closed Car Award at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is named in their honor.\n\nDeath\nNethercutt died on December 6, 2004 in Santa Monica.\n\nReferences\n\n1913 births\n2004 deaths\nPeople from South Bend, Indiana\nAmerican company founders\nAmerican car collectors\nCosmetics businesspeople\nAmerican cosmetics businesspeople\nNethercutt-Richards family", "machine_abstract": "J.

{"id": "Corruption in local government", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption%20in%20local%20government", "title": "Corruption in local government", "text": "Because there are many factors that can lead to corruption in local government, it is hard to study corruption patterns empirically, but recently, improved research strategies and information sources have made such studies better.\n\nTypes\nThere are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption pertaining to money like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and graft are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are nepotism and patronage systems. One historical example was the Black Horse Cavalry a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations.\n \n Bribery is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person's opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes. \n Extortion is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion.\n Embezzlement is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes.\n Nepotism is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities.\n Patronage systems consist of the granting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage.\n\nDemographic factors\n\nSocioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices. Patterns of political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up. Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender. Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption.\n\nSize of a municipality\nSmaller municipalities may be more prone to experience corruption within their local government. These towns and villages nominate (or self-nominate) residents or officials to represent and run the local government, sometimes without oversight approval from higher levels of government. In a small community, personal opinions and relationships play a larger role in politics. Due to this, problems like nepotism or extortion can be prevalent. In addition, some local governments face another kind of disadvantage - lack of experience and professionalism from their representatives. It can be a challenge to attract qualified up and coming politicians to small towns. Another major issue in small municipalities lies with accountability - some have inadequate or insufficient structures for policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials, culminating in a difficult situation for those affected.\n\nCondition of the local economy\nLow economic development has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material industries and drug trades are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of poverty and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower wages, which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones.\n\nEducation\nLower levels of education which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices. Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government. It is easier for corrupt office-holders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments. This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality well-structured, productive, and successful.\n\nPolitical culture of municipality\nMany local governments have an established political culture with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, accountability and legitimacy is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt because of the low accountability.In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to. Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.\n\nLinks and references\n\nAcademic references\n\n The Causes of Corruption: A Cross-National Study, Daniel Treisman, Department of Political Science, University of California\n Consequences and Causes of Corruption – What do We Know from a Cross-Section of Countries?, Johann Graf Lambsdorff\n A Handbook on Fighting Corruption, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE, U.S. Agency for International Development\n\nWeb references\n Corruption and Development, CHERYL W.

{"id": "Sitok Srengenge", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitok%20Srengenge", "title": "Sitok Srengenge", "text": "Sitok Srengenge (born 22 August 1965) is an Indonesian poet, actor, and dramatist. Born Sitok Sunarto in Purwodadi, Central Java, he became interested in literature at a young age and was heavily influenced by his village's strong oral tradition. When he moved to Jakarta to complete his university studies, he became involved with the Bengkel Teater under Rendra. Sitok remained with the company for almost a decade, appearing in several plays as he refined his literary style. His first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, was published in 1992.\n\nSitok has since published multiple poetry collections, including a bilingual work titled On Nothing and a trilogy of revised editions known collectively as Tripitakata, as well as a novel and serial. He has presented his poetry in such countries as the Netherlands and Germany, and participated in writers workshops in Hong Kong and Iowa. His poems, noted for their \"laconic, muscular, and musical\" poetic phrase, have been adapted to music in a variety of genres. In 1999, Asiaweek described Sitok as \"Indonesia's best young poet\".\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nSitok Srengenge was born Sitok Sunarto in Dorolegi, Purwodadi, Central Java, on 22 August 1965. Though the villagers did not support their children attending school, and elders would chase prospective students away, they maintained a strong oral tradition that Sitok credits with influencing the sonic qualities of his poetry. As a youth he was active in theatre, and by junior high school he had begun to write poetry. In a 2004 interview, he stated \"All I knew was that writing those words that lingered in my head made me happy\".\n\nDespite the resistance against education, Sitok obtained a scholarship which allowed him to complete his elementary and secondary school studies in the provincial capital of Semarang. He graduated from Senior High School 1, Semarang, in 1985.\n\nTheatre and first collection\nIn 1985, Sitok moved to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, to study at the Faculty of Art and Literature of the Jakarta Teacher Training Institute. There he became involved with Bengkel Teater under the poet-cum-dramatist Rendra, who gave him the name Sitok Srengenge, which translates from Javanese as \"the only sun\". In his ten years with Bengkel Teater, Sitok practiced poetry, monologues, and acting, and appeared in several of the troupe's plays.\n\nSitok published his first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, in 1992. Funded by the singer-songwriter Iwan Fals, this collection was intended as a counterpoint to the rise in religious literature which had become popular in Indonesia in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Sitok became an independent artist, acting under directors such as Ikranegara (Jam Berapa Sekarang) and Ratna Sarumpaet (Pesta Terakhir); he has remained active into the 2010s, portraying the Mahabharata warrior Karna in a 2011 play by Goenawan Mohamad. He also established his own theater troupe, Teater Matahari, as well as the Keranjang Sampah Kebudayaan (\"Cultural Wastebin\") discussion forum.\n\nShort stories by Sitok were included in the short story anthology Para Pembohong (The Liars) in 1996. Publication of the anthology was supported by Sitok's organization Gorong-Gorong Budaya, meant to encourage and support pro-democracy artists. Sitok was a founding member and one of the directors of the Utan Kayu Arts Community Center, serving as the director of its literary biennale and editor of its journal Kalam during the 1990s and 2000s. Beginning in 2007, he served as a curator for the Salihara cultural center until his resignation in 2013.\n\nAs a student, Sitok was involved in pro-democracy rallies against President Suharto. In the lead-up to Suharto's 1998 resignation, he would often attend underground rallies and discussions, reciting verses of poetry. None of these works had been anthologized by 2006. Sitok was one of the participants in the 1995 Istiqlal International Poetry Reading conference, which focused predominantly on Islamic poetry, and several of his poems were included in its publication The Poet's Chant. Bulgarian translations of his works were published in Chants of Nusantara that year.\n\nSubsequent collections\nIn 1999, Asiaweek wrote that Sitok \"is considered Indonesia's best young poet [and] often thought ... as contributing to the 'reawakening' of Indonesian literature\". The magazine selected him as \"one of twenty leaders for the Millennium in society and culture in Asia\". The translator and Indonesianist Harry Aveling, in his 2001 anthology Secrets Need Words, described Sitok as a \"pioneer\" leading poets out of \"the fear that froze the poets of the eighties\".\n\nIn 2000, Sitok published Anak Jadah (Bastard), a collection of poems described by Yenni Kwok of the Sunday Morning Post as \"a statement about the confusion of his generation\". Explaining the title, Sitok stated that \"Tradition and modernisation met in a careless encounter\" producing \"a generation of cultural bastards\". A second poetry collection, Nonsens, was published later that year by the Kalam Foundation in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, Ford Foundation, and Adikarya IKAPI Foundation. The collection contained thirty-five works, as well as several illustrations by Agus Suwage.\n\nSitok published his debut novel, Menggarami Burung Terbang (Salting a Flying Bird), in 2004. The work follows a group of common villagers (the Javanese wong cilik) in the period following the coup attempt of 1965. Pamela Allen, writing in Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, found the novel to have a \"rich, dense blend of realist prose in Indonesian, Javanese mythology and Javanese language\", making it unprecedented in works of Indonesian literature which deal with the subject matter. She argued that Sitok used local colour (warna lokal) not as a simple backdrop to a nationalist discourse, but rather to grant \"real insight into local ways of thinking and interpreting the world\".\n\nSitok released a bilingual volume of his poetry, On Nothing, at the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival. The poems in this second collection ranged from \"gentle and romantic\" to \"drenched in erotic images and metaphors\". The edition, published by Sitok's own publishing house Kata Kita, contains Indonesian and English versions of poems from his first four poetry collections, translated by four writers: Nukila Amal, Hasif Amini, Margaret Glade-Agusta, and Lauren Bain. of The Jakarta Post found \"both structured and unstructured poetry\" and \"themes connected to the human condition, such as love, motherhood, childbirth and racism\" in the collection.\n\nA trilogy of poetry collections, titled Tripitakata, was released in 2013. Its first volume, Gembala Waktu dan Madah Pereda Rindu, contained poems written by Sitok while still in senior high school and university, up through 1989.  The second volume, Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan dan Stanza Hijau Muda, was expanded on the previous collections Persetubuhan Liar and Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan with poems written between 1986 and 1991. The third, Anak Badai dan Amsal Puisi Banal, contained the poems of Anak Jadah as well as other poems written between 1986 and 1991. In August 2015, Sitok released another poetry collection, Ereignis dan Cinta yang Keras Kepala, which contained fifty poems written between 2010 and 2014.\n\nSitok has attended several writers workshops, including at the University of Iowa (2001) and Hong Kong Baptist University (2005). He has read his poems at the Indische Festival in the Hague, the Winternachten Festival in the Hague, the University of Leiden, and the University of Hamburg.\n\nStyle\nIn a 1999 interview with Asiaweek, Sitok compared writing to boxing, with essays and other prose as shadowboxing and poetry as \"real\" boxing. When reciting his poetry, he prefers rote memorization over reading published or written editions – something unusual among Indonesian poets. Sirikit Syah of The Jakarta Post describes him as having \"a powerful voice and impressive stage rhythm\" and of being \"a master of lexicon\". Krassin Himmirsky, who translated several of Sitok's poems into Bulgarian, found his \"poetic phrase ... laconic, muscular, and musical\", with a universal message.\n\nRegarding the writing process, Sitok has stated that \"There are poems within me. They are just there.\" He composes his poetry in his mind, and is reluctant to write them unless they are completed. He may produce as few as two poems a year.\nHe says that, although he may occasionally be influenced by politics, he tries to separate civic involvement and writing.\n\nImpact and critical reception\n\nSitok's work has been adapted to various media. In 2011, Dian HP produced Delapan Komposisi Cinta (Eight Compositions of Love), a concert for Ubiet Raseuki, using lyrics taken directly from the poems of Sitok and Nirwan Dewanto. In 2012 she released Semesta Cinta, an album of art songs based on Sitok's poetry. The Australian writer Jan Cornall released a jazz album, Singing Srengenge, based on the poet's work; Sitok's works have also been adapted by Denise Jannah and David Kotlowy.\n\nSitok's poetry has been compared to the work of numerous other poets, both Indonesian and non-Indonesian, including Pablo Neruda, Chairil Anwar, Iwan Simatupang, and Sitor Situmorang. Cornall describes Srengenge's work as \"deeply spiritual in the true sense of the word ... where the sensuality of longing, the beauty of sorrow, and the wisdom of deeply felt observation becomes the language of the soul\". Himmirsky finds Sitok's poems to include \"the true values of life, its pulsating dynamism and wisdom. ... [Readers] are deeply moved by his affection for his beloved, for his parents, for the human race.\" The translator John McGlynn writes that Sitok \"explores topics with a depth and maturity not only rare among his peers, but also with a vocabulary and clarity that few other poets can match\".\n\nPersonal life\nSitok is married to Farah Maulida. The couple have a daughter, Laire Siwi Mentari. She is a novelist, publishing her debut work Nothing but Love in 2004; by 2009 it had sold more than 40,000 copies. She has published a further novel, Aphrodite, and in 2009 was working on a short story collection.\n\nThe family lives in Bantul, Yogyakarta. Their home, construction of which began in 2006, sits on  of land and holds six buildings: the main house, a joglo style pavilion, a public library, private office, communal kitchen, and guest house. The open plan house itself is an \"eclectic\" design, \"fus[ing] ethnic and art deco styles\" and incorporating antique building materials from throughout Java. The landscaping itself maintains natural surroundings, avoiding artificial gardens.\n\nBibliography\n\nPoetry collections\n\nPersetubuhan Liar (1992)\nKelenjar Bekisar Jantan (2000?)\nAnak Jadah (2000)\nNonsens (2000)\nOn Nothing (2005)\nGembala Waktu dan Madah Pereda Rindu (2013)\nKelenjar Bekisar Jantan dan Stanza Hijau Muda (2013)\nAnak Badai dan Amsal Puisi Banal (2013)\nEreignis dan Cinta yang Keras Kepala (2015)\n\nProse\n\nMenggarami Burung Terbang  (novel; 2004)\nTrilogi Kutil (1984)\nCinta di Negeri Seribu Satu Tiran Kecil (essay collection; 2012)\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\n1965 births\n20th-century Indonesian poets\nLiving people\nIndonesian essayists\nIndonesian novelists\nIndonesian actors\nPeople from Central Java\n21st-century Indonesian poets\nIndonesian male poets\n20th-century essayists\n21st-century essayists\n20th-century male writers\n21st-century male writers\nJakarta State University alumni", "machine_abstract": "Sitok Srengenge (born in 1965) is the current Minister of Health and Social Affairs, Republic of Indonesia.\nSrengenge was born on September 16, 1965 at Magelang Regency Central Java Province to parents Sutarno and Sri Wiyono.

He was one of the key witnesses in the trial against the killers of Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone.\n\nLa Barbera was born in Altofonte, in the province of Palermo. In 1981, he was initiated in the Altofonte cosca and, in 1986, he became the regent of the Altofonte Mafia family after the arrest of Bernardo Brusca.\n\nAfter the arrest of Mafia boss Totò Riina in January 1993, the remaining bosses, among them La Barbera, Giuseppe Graviano, Matteo Messina Denaro, Giovanni Brusca, Leoluca Bagarella, and Antonino Gioè, came together a few times (often in the Santa Flavia area in Bagheria, on an estate owned by the mafioso Leonardo Greco). They decided on a strategy to force the Italian state to retreat. That resulted in a series of bomb attacks in 1993 in the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, in Via Palestro in Milan and in the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano, and Via San Teodoro in Rome, which left 10 people dead and 93 injured as well as damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery.\n\nOn March 23, 1993, La Barbera, Antonino Gioè and Salvatore Bentivegna were arrested in Milan. The police taped them while they were planning bomb attacks. La Barbera started to collaborate with the authorities in November 1993. \n\nLa Barbera confessed his participation in the slaying of Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone. He followed Falcone's car as it sped toward Palermo, keeping in constant touch with Leoluca Bagarella, Antonino Gioè and Giovanni Brusca on the hillside near Capaci. Brusca set off the explosion. \n\nHe also admitted to have been involved in the killing of Salvo Lima, the former mayor of Palermo.\n\nHis father Girolamo La Barbera (born in 1925) was murdered on June 10, 1994, because he defended the choice of his son to become a pentito. The killing was staged as a suicide. Among the killers were Michele Traina and Domenico Raccuglia. The order came from Giovanni Brusca. Traina and Raccuglia received life sentences for the killing in June 2005, while Brusca was sentenced to 13 years.\n\nIn October 1997, the pentito La Barbera was rearrested.

{"id": "Beckham in Peckham", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckham%20in%20Peckham", "title": "Beckham in Peckham", "text": "\"Beckham in Peckham\" is a 10 minute edition of the BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, broadcast as part of the Sport Relief 2014 appeal on 21 March 2014. Actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised their roles as Del Boy and Rodney in the sketch written by Jim Sullivan and Dan Sullivan; the script included previously unused material written by their father John Sullivan, who created and wrote every episode of the series. David Beckham guest starred,  Beckham having got in touch with Jim Sullivan.\n\nAccording to Shazam Productions there was a lot of interest in the sketch. The return of Only Fools and Horses was eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981 until 2003.\n\nThis special sketch was dedicated to the memory of John Sullivan and Roger Lloyd-Pack, who had both died prior to its broadcast.\n\nSynopsis \nAn unspecified amount of time after the series' last regular episode \"Sleepless in Peckham,\" Del Boy is in Peckham market, trying to sell \"Golden Balls\" underpants which are supposedly endorsed and signed by David Beckham (in return for Del Boy securing a bouncy castle for the birthday party of one of Beckham's son's, Brooklyn, who Del incorrectly calls Brookside), with Rodney serving as a less-than-enthusiastic model. After failing to sell anything, the Trotters retreat to a nearby cafe, where Rodney complains about Del's treatment of him. Del apologises, mentioning several incidents where he had mistreated Rodney. (These being incidents from previous regular Only Fools and Horses episodes.) Sharing the table with the two is David Beckham, who it turns out actually has endorsed the underpants. The three briefly chat, including Rodney and Beckham discussing their favourite artist (Rodney choosing Matisse, and Beckham choosing Tony Hart), before Beckham gives Rodney tips on how to model underwear effectively, advising him to \"glide\" and \"oscillate.\"\n\nLater on, Del is again trying to sell the underpants, with Rodney putting on a bizarre, vaguely feminine walk, and being even more angry at Del than he was before, telling him \"Derek, I'm going to kill you\". Beckham is discreetly watching this, when a young boy walks up to him, and asks him if he's David Beckham. He says that he is, and signs the boy's football, but says not to tell anyone he is there, as he does not want to draw anymore attention to himself. Beckham then attempts to lean back on a goods cart, but a trader moves it away while he isn't looking and he falls to the ground (referencing a famous moment in the episode \"Yuppy Love\"), getting the attention of everyone in the market. Del and Rodney comment, \"What a plonker!\"\n\nCast\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Sport Relief TV revealed\n Only Fools and Horses sketch to appear on Sport Relief\n Sport Relief 2014: David Beckham in Only Fools and Horses\n Only Fools and Horses to return with new sketch for Sport Relief\n\n2014 British television episodes\n2014 in British sport\nOnly Fools and Horses special episodes\nSport Relief", "machine_abstract": "David Beckham is the subject of this documentary film, which follows his life during one year when he moved to London from Los Angeles and lived near Peckham Rye station on the south-east side of the city.\nThe film was directed by David Kerr who had previously worked as director of photography on The Commitments (1991) and Michael Collins (1996).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Beckham in Peckham\".

{"id": "2797 Teucer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2797%20Teucer", "title": "2797 Teucer", "text": "2797 Teucer  is a large Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately  in diameter. It was discovered on 4 June 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8. In June 2014, an observed asteroid occultation gave a cross-section of  (poor fit).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR – Observatoire de Genève, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) – Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\n002797\nDiscoveries by Edward L.

{"id": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy%20and%20Ricky%20Ricardo", "title": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo", "text": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, also known simply as Lucy and Ricky or the Ricardos, are fictional characters from the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, portrayed respectively by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The Ricardos also appear in The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour, and Lucy also appears in one episode of The Ann Sothern Show.\n\nTogether, Lucy and Ricky serve as a double act. Ricky is the straight man, a character very similar to Arnaz himself; he is a Cuban-American bandleader whose trademark song is \"Babalu\". Red-haired Lucy is his wife, who always gets into trouble and is usually caught at it by Ricky. Their son, Ricky Ricardo Jr. (usually called \"Little Ricky\"), was born in the middle of the show's second season. He was portrayed by child actor Richard Keith beginning in season 6.\n\nLucy's full name (Lucille Esmeralda Ricardo  McGillicuddy) is given in the Season 1 episodes \"Fred and Ethel Fight\" and \"The Marriage License,\" and \"The Passports\" in Season 5. Ricky gives his full name in the Season 4 episode \"Hollywood Anniversary\" as Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha, but in the Season 6 episode \"Lucy Raises Tulips\" Lucy calls him \"Enrique Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha III\".\n\nFictional character biographies\n\nEarly lives \nMuch like Lucille Ball herself, Lucy McGillicuddy was born and raised in Jamestown, New York (or West Jamestown as revealed in Season 5), to an American family of Scottish descent. In one episode in which she is asked her birthday, she gives it as August 6 (the same as Ball's), though in typical fashion, she refuses to give the year; in another, where she is forced to tell the truth, she says she is 33 years old. This episode aired during the third season in 1953. This makes her born in the year 1920. \n\nIn the episode, her parents are never referred to by name, and only her mother (portrayed by Kathryn Card) is seen over the course of the series. No other family is even mentioned, except for a passing reference to her grandmother being Swedish (Jamestown has a large Swedish community). In the season 5 episode \"The Passports\", it is established she was born in 1921, therefore is exactly 10 years younger than Ball in real life.\n\nIn grammar school, she played a petunia in a recital. In high school, she was involved in the drama program, wherein she studied with Miss Hanna and played Juliet Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. She also played the saxophone in high school (as did the real Lucy), though every song she played sounded like \"The Glow-Worm\". Lucy also knows how to play the ukulele. She is seen playing a ukulele in episodes \"Ricky Loses His Voice\", \"Don Juan is Shelved\", and \"Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright\".\n\nA reference to Lucille's attendance at an unnamed junior college is made in the episode \"Fan Magazine Interview\" (1954); Jamestown Community College, the nearest junior college to Lucy's hometown, did not exist until 1950, although a business college and nursing school did exist in the city at the time.\n\nMarriage \nWhen she was 22, Lucy was set up on a blind date by her friend Marion Strong. Her blind date turned out to be a Cuban conga drummer, Ricky Ricardo. The two fell in love and eventually got married at the Byram River Beagle Club in Connecticut. An alternate scenario given to guest star Hedda Hopper in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour episode \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" with Lucy and friend Susie McNamara (Ann Sothern, reprising her role from Private Secretary), is that Lucy met Ricky while vacationing in Cuba in 1940.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Lucy and Ricky moved into an old reconverted brownstone apartment at 623 East 68th Street in New York City (references made during the series date the move to 1940 or 1943). In reality, this address does not exist (the last numbered building on E 68th Street is 590, so this address would be in the East River). The apartment rented for $105 per month. Their landlords (soon to be best friends) were Fred and Ethel Mertz. Lucy and Ethel quickly became best friends, even though Ethel is older than Lucy. Upon moving to the city, Ricky ends up getting a job headlining the Tropicana where he and his band are held over indefinitely.\n\nTo Lucy, Ricky's career and days seem so much more exciting than her days of cooking and cleaning. She desperately wants to be a star and constantly tries to get into Ricky's act. Ricky wants his wife to remain a homemaker. However, in spite of Ricky's reluctance and regular refusal to give her a role, Lucy sometimes finds a way into the show.\n\nBirth of Little Ricky \nIn 1952, after going to the doctor complaining of feeling \"dauncey\" (a word her grandmother made up; Lucy's definition of feeling \"dauncey\" is when you are not really sick but just feel lousy) and gaining weight, she learns that she is pregnant. It is actually Ethel who first suggests to Lucy she may be expecting, even before Lucy heads out to the doctor. Lucy is very excited to tell her husband the news.\n\nThe Mertzes learn the news first and are sworn to secrecy. When she was younger, Lucy had envisioned how she would tell her husband they were going to have a baby. She decides to tell Ricky when he comes home for lunch that afternoon. However, with repeated interruptions from the telephone and the Mertzes, she is unable. She tries to tell him down at his club during rehearsals, but is uncomfortable telling him such a personal thing in front of his band, so she runs out crying.\n\nFinally, that evening, while Ricky is performing, Lucy pens a note and passes it to the maître d'hotel. He gives the note to Ricky. Ricky reads the note, which alludes to a wife needing to tell her husband they are having a baby, and requests that he sing a particular song. Ricky, unaware that the \"husband\" mentioned in the note is himself, wants to bring the expectant couple up on stage to congratulate them. He goes from couple to couple trying to find them. Ricky notices Lucy in the audience, and it occurs to him that Lucy may be the one who is expecting. Lucy nods yes, and Ricky is overcome with emotion. They sing \"We're Having a Baby\", with Lucille Ball actually breaking down in tears during the scene.\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Lucy experiences the normal pregnancy woes. She becomes depressed when everyone seems to focus their attention on the impending child and not on Lucy. She cannot decide on a name for the child and is nervous that she will not be a good mother. However, she wants the best for her child and enrolls herself, Ricky, and the Mertzes in elocution lessons to make sure her child learns how to speak properly. Finally, she takes up sculpting so she and Ricky can enrich their child's life with art and music. However, Lucy's show business aspirations never wane. She manages to break into Ricky's barbershop quartet number by firing the man who has the part she wants.\n\nFinally, on January 19, 1953 — the same day she had her real-life son Desi Arnaz Jr. (technically IV) — while husband Ricky is performing a voodoo act at his nightclub, Lucy gives birth to Ricky Ricardo Jr. The Mertzes are named Little Ricky's godparents. Little Ricky grows on a season-by-season basis, and by the sixth season (1957), he has started school and learned to play the drums and speak Spanish.\n\nHollywood \nIn 1954, Ricky is given a role in an upcoming MGM film based on the life of Don Juan. Lucy and the Mertzes follow Ricky on his journey to Hollywood stardom. While in Hollywood, Lucy meets many famous celebrities, including William Holden, Hedda Hopper, Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark, Van Johnson and John Wayne. Some of these actors are celebrities that Ricky has already met as a result of his work.\n\nShe reports having spotted 99 celebrities while in Hollywood and finally procures an even 100 when she meets Wilde. Lucy is incredibly starstruck and saves anything that had come in contact with a celebrity, such as a can smashed by Cary Grant's left rear wheel. However, she does not just hobnob with celebrities; she also gets a few chances to break into show business herself.\n\nRicky gets her a small role in a film as a showgirl. Lucy's role requires her to wear a large headdress; she also gets a death scene. However, the headdress proves cumbersome, and her part is downgraded. She eventually ends up as a showgirl who is already dead on a stretcher when the scene begins. Lucy's second foray into show business is when she replaces Van Johnson's sick redheaded partner in his act at the hotel. She wants to impress her friend Carolyn Appleby and successfully coaxes Johnson give her the job through flattery.\n\nFinally, she has her third shot at stardom when she appears with a Ricky Ricardo dummy at a luncheon for movie executives. Ricky was asked to perform, but he declined in favor of a fishing trip he had planned. Lucy accepted on his behalf and schemed to build a dummy of Ricky and then pretend that he is ill, and she finishes the show herself. Her plan does not go as well as she had hoped, but she is still a success, as the executives think the performance is meant to be a comedy act, and she is offered a contract. However, she declines when she realizes that it would take her away from her husband, son and friends.\n\nEurope \nVery soon after returning home from Hollywood, Ricky's band is given a chance to tour around Europe. Fred is recruited as Ricky's band manager and Lucy and Ethel tag along. Lucy misses the boat and has to be lowered to the deck of the cruise ship, the USS Constitution, from a helicopter. They sail across the Atlantic, where Lucy has to settle for being partnered with a young boy to play games on deck but together they win a ping pong trophy. She also manages to get stuck in a porthole.\n\nAfter landing in England, Lucy gets the chance to perform for and meet Queen Elizabeth. She also participates in a fox hunt and gets to stay at an English estate.\n\nIn Paris, she meets Charles Boyer who has been warned by Ricky not to admit who he is because Lucy is so star-struck; Boyer takes his advice when Lucy corners him and claims he is Maurice DuBois, an out-of-work actor. Ricky has feigned jealousy about Lucy's obsession with Charles Boyer so she hires \"DuBois\" to impersonate Boyer and pitch woo to her in front of Ricky so she can reassure him with her total lack of interest. She coaches \"DuBois\" on Boyer's \"growl\" and mannerisms, remaining unaware that he is the real Boyer until Ethel calls her and reveals Ricky and Boyer's trick.\n\nIn another episode, Lucy is arrested by French police after inadvertently using counterfeit money. The scene that ensues, after Ricky arrives to bail her out, involves the only-French-speaking Commandante interrogating Lucy by directing questions to his French-and-German-speaking Lieutenant in French, who translates the questions into German and directs them to a drunken German-and-Spanish-speaking prisoner, who translates the questions into Spanish to ask Spanish-and-English-speaking Ricky, who makes the final translation into English for Lucy. Her answers must travel back up the chain to the Commandante.\n\nAlso, she stomps on grapes in Turo, a winemaking town in Italy, and wrestles her professional grape-stomping partner in a grape vat.\n\nMoving to Connecticut \nIn 1956, Lucy and Ricky decide to move to Connecticut after making a trip there, and Lucy falls in love with the area. Before they move in, though, she tries unsuccessfully to get out of the deal. Soon the Ricardos decide to raise chickens and sell the eggs. To help them with their business, their best friends, Fred Mertz and Ethel Mertz, move into their guest house, as Fred was raised on a farm. Lucy and Ricky also make close friends while in Connecticut, Betty and Ralph Ramsey (the Ricardos' next door neighbors).\n\nAfter I Love Lucy\nI Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour concluded in the aftermath of Arnaz and Ball's real-life divorce in 1960, an incident that was not written into the script. The characters remained married to each other at the end of the series' run.\n\nLucille Ball would go on to perform Lucy Ricardo-inspired characters on her ensuing sitcoms: The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and the short-lived Life with Lucy. In each series, the character Ball portrayed (each one named Lucy) was a widow or divorceé. In the mid-1960s, she was involved in a lawsuit against Jess Oppenheimer, the co-creator of I Love Lucy, over the similarities among the separate Lucy characters. The dispute was later settled out of court.\n\nArnaz only portrayed a similar Ricky Ricardo character once after The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour ended its run: in a recurring role on The Mothers-in-Law, Arnaz portrayed matador Raphael Delgado, with the same accent and personality as Ricky (as a Desilu production, The Mothers-in-Law used many of the same writers and executive staff as the Lucy shows).\n\nOther television series, especially those created by Desilu (the production company Arnaz and Ball co-founded) sought to copy the Lucy Ricardo theme. Even Janis Paige, in her short-lived Desilu produced CBS sitcom It's Always Jan, wore her hair like Lucy's, and Cara Williams followed the Lucy Ricardo format in Pete and Gladys, which lasted only two seasons on CBS.\n\nReferences \n\nI Love Lucy characters\nFictional characters from New York (state)\nTelevision characters introduced in 1951\nFictional families\nFictional married couples\nTelevision duos\nIntercultural and interracial relationships", "machine_abstract": "Lucille Ball as Lucy Ricardo, the title character of I Love Lucy , in this publicity still from 1951 .

He played for the Baltimore Orioles in 1980. He spent the majority of his career in the minor leagues, playing for the Class AA Charlotte O's in the 1980s.\n\nBiography\nHazewood was a first round pick, and the nineteenth player selected overall, by Baltimore in 1977. He spent that first season with the rookie-league Bluefield Orioles and was promoted to the Class A Miami Orioles for the 1978 season. In 1979, he hit 21 home runs with the Class AA Charlotte O's of the Southern League.\n\nHe made his major league debut in 1980. Despite a .583 batting average during spring training, he only joined the Orioles as a September call-up, appearing in six games and going hitless in five plate appearances with four strikeouts.\n\nIn 1981, Hazewood was back in the minor leagues. He struggled in 18 games with the Class AAA Rochester Red Wings, getting 6 hits in 64 at bats. He spent most of the year in Class AA with Charlotte. Hazewood hit .226 with 11 home runs and 28 stolen bases in 1982. In 1983, his last baseball season, Hazewood hit a combined .247 for two minor league teams. He left baseball during that season to take care of his mother, who had been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nHazewood was known as a power hitter who struck out frequently and had difficulty hitting a curveball. He had more strikeouts than hits in every major league and minor league season he played. Former teammates have recalled Hazewood's strength and speed. Cal Ripken, Jr. described an incident in which Hazewood had snapped a baseball bat simply by twisting it.\n\nHazewood died from cancer at his home in South Sacramento, California, on July 28, 2013.  He was 53 years old.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1959 births\n2013 deaths\nAfrican-American baseball players\nBaltimore Orioles players\nBaseball players from Alabama\nBaseball players from Sacramento, California\nBluefield Orioles players\nCharlotte O's players\nMajor League Baseball outfielders\nMiami Orioles players\nSportspeople from Mobile, Alabama\nRochester Red Wings players\nSan Jose Bees players\nDeaths from cancer in California\n20th-century African-American sportspeople\n21st-century African-American people", "machine_abstract": "The Drungo Hazewood is the second album by Scottish rock band Camera Obscura, released in 2002 on their own label Rockers International Records and distributed through Vertigo Records.\nIt was produced by Paul White (Belle & Sebastian) at his studio in Glasgow's West End.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Drungo Hazewood\".

{"id": "Gangsta rap", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta%20rap", "title": "Gangsta rap", "text": "Gangsta rap or gangster rap, initially called reality rap, emerged in the mid- to late 1980s as a controversial hip hop subgenre whose lyrics assert the culture and values typical of American street gangs and street hustlers. Many gangsta rappers flaunt associations with real street gangs, like the Crips and the Bloods. Gangsta rap's pioneers were Schoolly D of Philadelphia in 1985, Ice-T of Los Angeles in 1986, and especially N.W.A in 1988. In 1993, via record producer Dr. Dre, rapper Snoop Dogg, and their G-funk sound, gangsta rap took the rap genre's lead and became mainstream, popular music.\n\nGangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and drug dealing, as well as misogyny, promiscuity, and materialism. Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or police brutality, and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including Spike Lee, but first by pastor Calvin Butts and especially by activist C. Delores Tucker.\n\n1985–1988: Origins and early years\n\nSchoolly D and Ice-T\nPhiladelphia rapper Schoolly D is generally considered the first “gangsta rapper” or one of the first “gangsta rappers”, significantly influencing the more popular early gangsta rap originator, Ice-T. Ice-T was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1958. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles where he rose to prominence in the West Coast hip hop scene. In 1986, Ice-T released \"6 in the Mornin'\", which is regarded as one of the first gangsta rap songs. Ice-T had been MCing since the early '80s, but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D and his 1985 album Schoolly D. In an interview with PROPS magazine, Ice-T said:\n\nHere's the exact chronological order of what really went down: The first record that came out along those lines was Schoolly D's \"P.S.K.\" Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made \"6 in the Mornin'\". The vocal delivery was the same: ' ... P.S.K. is makin' that green', ' ... six in the morning, police at my door'. When I heard that record I was like \"Oh shit!\" and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn't sound like P.S.K., but I liked the way he was flowing with it. P.S.K. was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was \"... one by one, I'm knockin' em out.\" All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down and all that with \"6 in the Mornin'\". At the same time my single came out, Boogie Down Productions hit with Criminal Minded, which was a gangster-based album. It wasn't about messages or \"You Must Learn\", it was about gangsterism.\n\nIn 2011, Ice-T repeated in his autobiography that Schoolly D was his inspiration for gangsta rap. Ice-T continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s: Rhyme Pays in 1987, Power in 1988 and The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say in 1989. Ice-T's lyrics also contained strong political commentary, and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a no-win situation.\n\nSchoolly D's debut album, Schoolly D, and especially the song \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\", would heavily influence not only Ice-T, but also Eazy-E and N.W.A (most notably in the song \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\") as well as the Beastie Boys on their seminal hardcore hip hop inspired album Licensed to Ill (1986).\n\nBoogie Down Productions\nBoogie Down Productions released their first single, \"Say No Brother (Crack Attack Don't Do It)\", in 1986. It was followed by \"South-Bronx/P is Free\" and \"9mm Goes Bang\" in the same year. The latter is the most gangsta-themed song of the three; in it, KRS-One boasts about shooting a crack dealer and his posse to death (in self-defense). The album Criminal Minded followed in 1987, and was the first rap album to have firearms on its cover. Shortly after the release of this album, BDP's DJ, Scott LaRock was shot and killed. After this, BDP's subsequent records were more focused with the inadequate rationale removed.\n\nOther early influences\nThe New York-based Run-DMC and LL Cool J, though originating prior to the establishment of “gangsta rap” as a cohesive genre, were influential in the formation of gangsta rap, often producing early aggressive hardcore hip hop songs and being among the first rappers to dress in gang-like street clothing. The seminal Long Island-based group Public Enemy featured aggressive, politically charged lyrics, which had an especially strong influence on gangsta rappers such as Ice Cube. Rakim and Eric B & Rakim would further influence gangsta rap with aggressive, street-oriented raps, especially on the 1987 album Paid In Full .\n\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles-based group C.I.A. (consisting of Ice Cube, K-Dee, Sir Jinks) rapped over the rap group Beastie Boys’ tracks for songs such as \"My Posse\" and \"Ill-Legal\", and the Beastie Boys' influence can be seen significantly in N.W.A's early albums.  The Beastie Boys had started out as a hardcore punk band, but after introduction to producer Rick Rubin and the exit of Kate Schellenbach they became a rap group. According to Rolling Stone Magazine, their 1986 album Licensed to Ill is \"filled with enough references to guns, drugs and empty sex (including the pornographic deployment of a Wiffleball bat in \"Paul Revere\") to qualify as a gangsta-rap cornerstone.\"\n\n1988–1997: Golden age\n\nN.W.A.\nThe first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988. Straight Outta Compton would establish West Coast hip hop as a vital genre, and establish Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. Straight Outta Compton sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song \"Fuck tha Police\" earned a letter from FBI Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing law enforcement's resentment of the song. Due to the influence of Ice-T, N.W.A, and Ice Cube's early solo career, gangsta rap is often somewhat erroneously credited as being a mostly West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Boogie Down Productions in shaping the genre and despite Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D being generally regarded as the first gangsta rapper.\n\nIn the early 1990s, former N.W.A member Ice Cube would further influence gangsta rap with his hardcore, socio-political solo albums, which suggested the potential of gangsta rap as a political medium to give voice to inner-city youth. N.W.A's second album, Efil4zaggin (1991) (released after Ice Cube's departure from the group), broke ground as the first gangsta rap album to reach #1 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\nWest, East and South\nAside from N.W.A and Ice T, Too Short (from Oakland, California), Kid Frost and the South Gate-based Latino group Cypress Hill were pioneering West Coast rappers with gangsta rap songs and themes. Above the Law also played an important role in the gangsta rap movement, as their 1990 debut album Livin' Like Hustlers, as well as their guest appearance on N.W.A's 1991 Efil4zaggin, foreshadowed the dominance of the genre in 1990s starting with Dr. Dre's The Chronic.\n\nEast Coast hardcore rappers like Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, and EPMD also reflected the trend in hip-hop music in the late 1980s towards hard-hitting, angry, aggressive, and politically conscious lyrics, revolving around crime, violence, poverty, war and gunplay.\n\nThe Houston-based group known as the Geto Boys came out around the late 1980s and made songs containing both gangsta themes of crime and violence. Early 90s, the Geto Boys gained Top 40 hit \"Mind Playing Tricks On Me\". The group notably released gangsta song \"Scarface\", a track centered on selling cocaine and killing rival gang members. The Geto Boys are also known for being the first rap group to sample from the movie Scarface, a film which became the basis for various mafioso rap samples in the 1990s. Furthermore, the Geto Boys, along with Jam Master J's and Erick Sermon's group Flatlinerz and Prince Paul's and RZA's group Gravediggaz, are often cited as pioneers of \"horrorcore\" rap, a transgressive and abrasive subgenre of hardcore rap or gangsta rap which focuses on common horror themes, such as the supernatural and the occult, often with gothic or macabre lyrics, satanic imagery and slasher film or splatter film-like violence.\n\nIce-T's solo career\nIce-T released one of the seminal albums of the genre, OG: Original Gangster in 1991. It also contained a song by his new thrash metal group Body Count, who released a self titled album in 1992. Particular controversy surrounded one of its songs \"Cop Killer\". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a police target seeking revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the National Rifle Association and various police advocacy groups. Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T's upcoming album Home Invasion and dropped Ice-T from the label. Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips \"... they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that.\" In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of Cop Killer, the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.\"\n\nIce-T's next album, Home Invasion was postponed as a result of the controversy, and was finally released in 1993. While it contained gangsta elements, it was his most political album to date. After a proposed censoring of the Home Invasion album cover art, he left Warner Bros. Records. Ice-T's subsequent releases went back to straight gangsta-ism, but were never as popular as his earlier releases. He had alienated his core audience with his involvement in metal, his emphasis on politics and with his uptempo Bomb-Squad style beats during a time when G-funk was popular. He published a book \"The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a @#!*% ?\" in 1994.\n\nG-funk and Death Row Records\n\nIn 1992, former N.W.A member Dr. Dre released The Chronic, a massive seller (eventually going triple platinum) which showed that explicit gangsta rap could hold mass commercial appeal just like more pop-oriented rappers such as MC Hammer, The Fresh Prince and Tone Lōc. The album established the dominance of West Coast gangsta rap and Dre's new post-N.W.A label, Death Row Records (owned by Dr. Dre along with Marion \"Suge\" Knight), as Dre's album showcased a stable of promising new Death Row rappers. The album also began the subgenre of G-funk, a slow, drawled form of hip hop that dominated the rap charts for some time.\n\nExtensively sampling P-Funk bands, especially Parliament and Funkadelic, G-funk was multi-layered, yet simple and easy to dance to. The simple message of its lyrics, that life's problems could be overcome by guns, alcohol, and marijuana, endeared it to a teenage audience. The single \"Nuthin' but a \"G\" Thang\" became a crossover hit, with its humorous, House Party-influenced video becoming an MTV staple despite that network's historic orientation towards rock music.\n\nAnother success was Ice Cube's Predator album, released at about the same time as The Chronic in 1992. It sold over 5 million copies and was #1 in the charts, propelled by the hit single \"It Was a Good Day\", despite the fact that Ice Cube was not a Death Row artist. One of the genre's biggest crossover stars was Dre's protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg (Doggystyle), whose exuberant, party-oriented themes made songs such as \"Gin and Juice\" club anthems and top hits nationwide. In 1996, 2Pac signed with Death Row and released the multi-platinum double album All Eyez on Me. Not long afterward, his shocking murder brought gangsta rap into the national headlines and propelled his posthumous The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory album (released under the alias \"Makaveli\") (which eerily featured an image of 2Pac being crucified on the front cover) to the top of the charts. Warren G was another G-funk musician along with the now deceased Nate Dogg. Other successful G-funk influenced artists included Spice 1, MC Eiht and MC Ren, all of them reaching decent positions on the Billboard 100, in spite of not being associated with Death Row.\n\nMafioso rap\nMafioso rap is a hardcore hip hop subgenre founded by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s. East coast mafioso rap was partially the counterpart of West Coast G-funk rap. Mafioso rap is characterized by references to famous mobsters and mafiosi, racketeering and organized crime in general (but especially the Sicilian Mafia, the Italian-American Mafia, African-American organized crime and Latin American organized crime or drug cartels). Though a significant amount of mafioso rap was more gritty and street-oriented, focusing on street-level organized crime, other mafioso rap artists frequently focused on lavish, self-indulgent, materialistic and luxurious subject matter associated with crime bosses and high-level mobsters, such as expensive drugs, cars and expensive champagne. Though the genre died down for several years, it re-emerged in 1995 when Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically acclaimed solo album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... It. 1995 also saw the release of Doe or Die by Nas' protégé AZ and the release of the album 4,5,6 by subgenre originator Kool G Rap. This album featured other mafioso rap artists MF Grimm, Nas and B-1. These three albums brought the genre to mainstream recognition, and inspired other East Coast artists, such as Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G. and Nas, to adopt the same themes as well with their albums Reasonable Doubt, Life After Death and It Was Written (respectively).\n\nEast coast gangsta rap was popular by the late 1990s, and there were more modern mafioso rap albums such as Ghostface Killah's Fishscale, Jay-Z's American Gangster and Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II.  Many rappers, such as Conejo, Mr Criminal, T.I., Rick Ross, Fabolous, Jadakiss, Jim Jones and Cassidy have maintained popularity with lyrics about self-centered urban criminal lifestyles or \"hustling\". Lil' Kim's mafioso album La Bella Mafia, released in 2003, was a commercial success, receiving platinum certification. In 2020, Belgian rapper CHG Unfadable released the mafioso rap album Lifestyle featuring Kool G Rap, AZ and the first Italian-American mob rapper The Shark. After a long slump in the popularity of Mafioso rap, music collective Griselda re-popularised nostalgic Mafioso rap and boom-bap rap style of the 90s and 80s with artists such as Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Benny the Butcher, and Daringer.\n\nEast Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast–West Coast feud\nMeanwhile, rappers from New York City, such as Wu-Tang Clan, Black Moon (group) and Boot Camp Clik, Onyx, Big L, Mobb Deep, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., DMX, and The LOX, among others, pioneered a grittier sound known as hardcore hip hop. In 1994, both Nas and The Notorious B.I.G. released their debut albums Illmatic (April 19) and Ready to Die (September 13) respectively, which paved the way for New York City to take back dominance from the West Coast. In an interview for The Independent in 1994, the Wu-Tang Clan's GZA commented on the term \"gangsta rap\" and its association with his group's music and hip hop at the time:\n\nIt is widely speculated that the ensuing \"East/West\" battle between Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records resulted in the deaths of Death Row Records' 2Pac (who was 25 years old) and Bad Boy Records' The Notorious B.I.G. (who was 24 years old). Even before the murders, Death Row had begun to unravel, as co-founder Dr. Dre had left earlier in 1996; in the aftermath of 2Pac's death, label owner Suge Knight was sentenced to prison for a parole violation, and Death Row proceeded to sink quickly as most of its remaining artists, including Snoop Dogg, left. Dr. Dre, at the MTV Video Music Awards, claimed that \"gangsta rap was dead\". While Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Entertainment fared better than its West Coast rival, it eventually began to lose popularity and support by the end of the decade, due to its pursuit of a more mainstream sound, as well as challenges from Atlanta and New Orleans-based labels, especially, Master P's No Limit stable of popular rappers.\n\nSouthern and Midwest gangsta rap\nHouston first came on to the national scene in the late 1980s with the violent and disturbing stories told by the Geto Boys, with member Scarface achieving major solo success in the mid-1990s. Willie D recorded G rap album also.\nAfter the deaths of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls and the media attention the murders generated, gangsta rap became an even greater commercial force. However, most of the industry's major labels were in turmoil, bankrupt, or creatively stagnant, and new labels representing the rap scenes in new locations sprang up.\n\nMaster P's No Limit Records label, based out of New Orleans, became quite popular in the late 1990s, though critical success was very scarce, with the exceptions of some later additions like Mystikal (Ghetto Fabulous, 1998). No Limit had begun its rise to national popularity with Master P's The Ghetto Is Trying to Kill Me! (1994), and had major hits with Silkk the Shocker (Charge It 2 Da Game, 1998) and C-Murder (Life or Death, 1998). Cash Money Records, also based out of New Orleans, had enormous commercial success beginning in the late 1990s with a similar musical style but utilized a quality-over-quantity business approach unlike No Limit.\n\nMemphis collective Hypnotize Minds, led by Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat, have taken gangsta rap to some of its darker extremes. Led by in-house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J, the label became known for its pulsating, menacing beats and uncompromisingly thuggish lyrics. However, in the mid-2000s, the group began attaining more mainstream popularity, eventually culminating in the Three 6 Mafia winning an Academy Award for the song \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" from Hustle & Flow.\n\nMidwest gangsta rap originated in the mid-1990s and rose to major prominence in the 2000s. Midwest hip hop was originally distinctive for its faster-paced flow. This is evident in the styles of the earliest Midwestern rappers to release albums, Chicago's Twista and Cleveland's Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Bone Thugs, known for their fast, harmonizing vocals coupled with an ultra-quick rap delivery, would achieve major success with their critically acclaimed 1995 album E. 1999 Eternal, which featured a major hit in the Grammy-winning \"Tha Crossroads\".\n\nThe Chopped and Screwed genre was developed in Houston, Texas which remains the location most associated with the style. The late DJ Screw, a South Houston DJ, is credited with the creation of and early experimentation with the genre. DJ Screw began making mixtapes of the slowed-down music in the early 1990s and began the Screwed Up Click. This provided a significant outlet for MCs in the South-Houston area, and helped local rappers such as Big Moe, Lil' Flip, E.S.G., UGK, Lil' Keke, South Park Mexican, Spice 1 and Z-Ro gain regional and sometimes national prominence.\n\nNarco-rap\nNarco-rap is a music scene, similar to the early underground gangsta rap scene, that emerged in north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas. Its lyrical content, popular among Latino youth, is violent and focuses on the power of drug cartels and the gruesomeness of the Mexican drug war. Narco-rap emerged in the urban areas of Tamaulipas, a Mexican state currently subject to a turf war between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Narco-rappers sing about the life of mobsters and the reality of the cities under the cartel's rule. Some of the key players of the genre are Cano y Blunt, DemenT and Big Los.\n\n1997–2007: Bling era\nBefore the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not \"selling out\" to the pop charts. However, the rise of Bad Boy Records, propelled by the massive crossover success of Bad Boy head Sean \"Puffy\" Combs's 1997 ensemble album, No Way Out, on the heels of the media attention generated by the murders of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G., signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (or as it is referred to on the East Coast, hardcore rap), as it morphed into a new subgenre of hip hop which would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted.\n\nThe earlier, somewhat controversial crossover success enjoyed by popular gangsta rap songs like \"Gin and Juice\" gave way to gangsta rap's becoming a widely accepted staple on the pop charts in the late 1990s. For example, between the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album Ready to Die in 1994 and his follow-up, the posthumous Life After Death in 1997, his sound changed from a darker, tense production, with lyrics projecting desperation and paranoia, to a cleaner, more laid-back sound, fashioned for popular consumption (though the references to guns, drug dealing and life as a thug on the street remained).\n\nR&B-styled hooks and instantly recognizable samples of well-known soul and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased primarily in Sean \"Puffy\" Combs's latter-day production work for The Notorious B.I.G. (\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\"), Mase (\"Feels So Good\") and non-Bad Boy artists such as Jay-Z (\"Can I Get A...\") and Nas (\"Street Dreams\"). Also achieving similar levels of success with a similar sound at the same time as Bad Boy was Master P and his No Limit label in New Orleans, as well as the New Orleans upstart Cash Money label.\n\nMany of the artists who achieved such mainstream success in the 2000s, such as Jay-Z, DMX, then 50 Cent and G-Unit, originated from the gritty 1990s East Coast rap scene and were influenced by hardcore artists such as The Notorious B.I.G., Wu-Tang Clan and Nas. Mase and Cam'ron were typical of a more relaxed, casual flow that became the pop-gangsta norm. By contrast, other rappers like Eminem and DMX enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s by rapping about ever-more macabre tales of death and violence, maintaining commercial relevance by attempting to be controversial and subversive, growing on the Horrorcore rap style born in the late 1980s.\n\n2007–present: Mainstream decline, rise of drill and trap\n\nBy the late 2000s, alternative hip hop had secured its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap. Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's Curtis as a turning point for hip hop. Kanye West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so. Although he designed it as a melancholic pop album rather than a rap album, Kanye's following 808s & Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album was predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music. During the release of The Blueprint 3, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, \"... it's not gonna be a #1 album. That's where I'm at right now. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made.\" Jay-Z elaborated that like Kanye, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear, and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip-hop.\n\nIn the 2010s, a new form of gangsta rap known as drill emerged from the Midwest, gaining popularity via rappers such as Lil Durk, Chief Keef, Lil Reese, King Von, and Lil Herb. West Coast rapper Vince Staples is part of the new generation of rappers that is influenced by G-funk. Being from the same area as Snoop himself, Staples has a sound that is lyrically in comparison to gangsta rap, though also containing elements of conscious rap. His 2015 album Summertime '06 reflects the \"challenges of racism, injustice, and violent fallouts in his childhood neighborhood.\" Other gangsta rappers who have maintained success in recent times include Rick Ross, Jeezy, Nipsey Hussle, Gucci Mane, Freddie Gibbs, Meek Mill, Ace Hood, Pusha T, YG, A$AP Ferg, Bobby Shmurda, A$AP Rocky, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, Dave East, Tay-K, Uncle Murda, Casanova, Blueface, NLE Choppa, Lil Loaded, Pop Smoke, 22Gz, 42 Dugg, Lil Baby, and DaBaby.\n\nGangsta rap's pioneers have met success in other forms of pop culture as well. In 2016, N.W.A. was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were followed up by the late Tupac Shakur in 2017 who was inducted as the first solo hip hop act, under his first year of eligibility as a nominee. Other Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Hip-Hop Acts include the 2007 induction of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, who are considered pioneers of expanding the sound of Hip-Hop from disco inspired partying, to street reality that inspired social change. The 2009 induction of Run-D.M.C to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened the door for more Hip-Hop inductions, as they were followed up by the 2012 induction of Beastie Boys, and the 2013 induction of Public Enemy.\n\nCriticism and debate\nThe explicit nature of gangsta rap's lyrics has made it heavily controversial. There is also debate about the causation between gangsta rap and violent behavior. A study by the Prevention Research Center of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Berkeley, Calif., finds young people who listen to rap and hip-hop are more likely to abuse alcohol and commit violent acts.\n\nCritics of gangsta rap hold that it glorifies and encourages criminal behavior, and may be at least partially to blame for the problem of street gangs. Although this view is often stereotyped as that of white conservatives, it has been shared by members of the black community, most notably Bill Cosby.\n\nThose who are supportive or at least less critical of gangsta rap hold that crime on the street level is for the most part a reaction to poverty and that gangsta rap reflects the reality of lower class life. Many believe that the blaming of crime on gangsta rap is a form of unwarranted moral panic; The World Development Report 2011, for instance, confirmed that most street gang members maintain that poverty and unemployment is what drove them to crime; none made reference to music. Ice Cube famously satirized the blame placed on gangsta rap for social ills in his song \"Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It\". Many gangsta rappers maintain they are playing a \"role\" in their music like an actor in a play or film, and do not encourage the behavior in their music.\n\nMoreover, English scholar Ronald A.T. Judy has argued that gangsta rap reflects the experience of blackness at the end of political economy, when capital is no longer wholly produced by human labor but in a globalized system of commodities. In this economy, gangsta rap traffics blackness as a commodifiable effect of \"being a nigga\". In other words, gangsta rap defines the experience of blackness, in which he locates in gangsta rap's deployment of the word \"nigga\", in this new global economic system as \"adaptation to the force of commodification\". For Judy, nigga (and gangsta rap) becomes an epistemologically authentic category for describing the condition of being black in the modern \"realm of things\".\n\nDespite this, many who hold that gangsta rap is not responsible for social ills are critical of the way many gangsta rappers intentionally exaggerate their criminal pasts for the sake of street credibility. Rick Ross and Slim Jesus among others have been heavily criticized for this.\n\n2Pacalypse Now controversy\nIn 1992, then-U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle blasted the recording industry for producing rap music he believed led to violence. Quayle called on Time Warner Inc. subsidiary, Interscope Records, to withdraw Tupac Shakur's 1991 debut album 2Pacalypse Now from stores. Quayle stated, \"There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published—It has no place in our society.\" Quayle's motivation came in light of the murder of a Texas state trooper Bill Davidson, who had been shot by Ronald Ray Howard after he had been pulled over. Howard was driving a stolen vehicle while songs from 2Pacalypse Now were playing on the tape deck when he was stopped by the officer. The family of Davidson filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope Records, claiming the record's violent lyrics incite \"imminent lawless action\". District Judge John D. Rainey held that Shakur and the record companies did not have the duty to prevent distributing his music when they could not reasonably foresee violence arising from the distribution, nor was there any intent for the usage of the music as a \"product for purposes of recovery under a products liability theory.\" Judge Rainey concluded the suit by ruling the Davidsons' argument that the music was unprotected speech under the First Amendment was irrelevant.\n\nC. Delores Tucker\nPoliticians such as C. Delores Tucker have cited concerns with sexually explicit and misogynistic lyrics featured in hip-hop tracks. Tucker claimed the explicit lyrics used in hip-hop songs were threatening to the African-American community. Tucker, who once was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Pennsylvania state government, focused on rap music in 1993, labeling it as \"pornographic filth\" and claiming it was offensive and demeaning to black women. Tucker stated, \"You can't listen to all that language and filth without it affecting you.\" Tucker also handed out leaflets containing lyrics from rap music and urged people to read them aloud. She picketed stores that sold the music and handed out petitions. She then proceeded to buy stock in Time Warner, Sony and other companies for the sole purpose to protest rap music at shareholders meetings. In 1994, Tucker protested when the NAACP nominated rapper Tupac Shakur for one of its image awards as Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture from his role in Poetic Justice.\n\nSome rappers labeled her \"narrow-minded\", and some ridiculed her in their lyrics, notably Shakur, who mentions her multiple times in his diamond certified 1996 album All Eyez On Me. Shakur mentions Tucker in the tracks \"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\" and \"How Do U Want It\", where Shakur sings \"Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker/Instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother.\" Tucker filed a $10 million lawsuit against Shakur's estate for the comments made in both songs. In her lawsuit, she claimed that the comments were slanderous, caused her emotional distress and invaded her personal privacy. The case was eventually dismissed. Shakur was not the only rap artist to mention her in his songs, as Jay-Z, Eminem, Lil' Kim, The Game and Lil Wayne have all previously criticized Tucker for her opposition of the genre.\n\nFirst Amendment rights\nGangsta rap has also raised questions of whether it is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, since lyrics may express violence and may be considered true threats. The Supreme Court ruled in Elonis v. United States (2015) that mens rea, the intent to commit a crime, is necessary to convict someone of a crime for using threatening words in a rap song.\n\nIn a notable case, rapper Jamal Knox, performing as \"Mayhem Mal\", wrote a gangsta rap song named \"F*** the Police\" shortly after he was arrested for gun and drug charges in Pittsburgh. The song's lyrics specifically named the two arresting officers, and included explicit violent threats including \"Let's kill these cops cuz they don't do us no good\". One of the officers, believing to be threatened, subsequently left the force.\n\nKnox was convicted of making terroristic threats and of witness intimidation in a bench trial, and the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held that the song's lyrics amounted to a true threat. Knox petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case, and academics joined rappers Killer Mike, Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, Yo Gotti, Fat Joe and 21 Savage in an amicus curiae brief arguing that Knox's song should be seen as a political statement and thus is protected speech. The Supreme Court declined review in April 2019.\n\nInternational influence\n\nGerman gangsta-rap \n\nThe gangsta-rap movement in Germany derived its roots from the '90s and since 2003–2004 has become a successful subgenre of German hip hop. Contextually and musically, it borrows its influences from the French and US-based gangsta rap and battle rap. Although there is a certain correlation between street-rap and gangsta-rap, gangsta-rap is not considered as a derivative genre since it is only partially related to street-rap and has contextually little to do with the other subgenre.\n\nHistory\nPioneers of the subgenre gangsta-rap, who have since the 1990s still been active, are Kool Savas and Azad. Within the genre, they implemented an incredibly explicit, broken and aggressive text, that originally still had much influence from English text elements. This style of rap, after the turn of the century, was implemented by the majority of gangsta-rappers in Germany and is, therefore, a very well respected form on the approach of German gangsta-rap. On the other hand, Savas distanced himself from these vulgar and explicit texts. One of the founding fathers of German gangsta-rap, Charnell, the little-known rapper and martial-arts artist, thematized growing up in the midst of a social renaissance. Gangsta-rap in other countries, that resembled the music of the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt in Germany, was commercially successful in the 2000s. Germany at the time, however, had few rappers active in this subgenre; allowing certain artists in the Berlin underground-hip-hop scene an opportunity to establish themselves with their lyrics representing a certain hardship acquired through the criminal lifestyle which had previously been popularized. Recognizable names from the underground scene are Bass Sultan Hengzt, Fler, MC Bogy or MOK. Another notable rapper and pioneer of gangsta-rap in Germany is Azad. Although he came from the rural Frankfurt am Main, he was a big reason this subgenre became popular in Germany. In his lyrical text, he thematized the rigid and rough lifestyle of living in the northwest district of Frankfurt.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2003 the process of commercialization of this subgenre began. Contrary to popular belief, a variable of the German gangsta-rap became popular before the actual subgenre itself did. When Sido, a notoriously known rapper from Berlin, released his album Maske which thematized gangs, drugs and violence, this album became the first of its genre to sell 100,000 copies. Following that album Sido released another two named Ich and Ich und meine Maske which both had over 100,000 sold copies and emphasized the success of his first album.\n\nFollowing the success of Sido and his albums, Bushido became the next artist to emerge from the German gangsta-rap scene. He established himself a career and became the most important representative of German gangsta-rap of his time. Aggro Berlin, the label those two artists were both represented by, stated that this version of rap was the second, more aggressive evolution of German hip-hop. Bushido's albums Carlo Cokxxx Nutten with Fler and Bushido's debut album Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline had relatively little success although the prominent topics on his album reflected directly with the themes that made Sido popular.\n\nFollowing the continuous success of Sido and Bushido came a wave of rappers who were trying, with the help of major-labels, to establish themselves and be recognized by the populace. Eventually came Massiv, who was signed with Sony BMG, and was crowned by his label to be the German 50 Cent. This artist did not reach the success of 50 Cent. Further artists such as Baba Saad or Kollegah have since then established themselves as relatively successful in the German charts. As of recently, names such as Farid Bang, Nate57, Majoe & Jasko and Haftbefehl have appeared on the charts regularly.\n\nMusical style\nGangsta-rap in Germany originated from Queensbridge-rap in the 1990s as well as French gangsta-rap. Characteristically the necessary ambiance and melody for this type of hip-hop needs to be melancholic, dark and often threatening. Often, the songs incorporate piano, choir, synthesizers, but also samples from classical and neo-classical arrangements. All complexities such as minimalistic arrangements to vast orchestral symphonic arrangements are used and sampled in this subgenre.\n\nRoad rap \n\nRoad rap (also known as British gangsta rap or simply UK rap) is a genre of music pioneered in South London, primarily in Brixton and Peckham. The genre was pioneered by groups such as PDC, SMS, GAS, PYG, SN1, North Star, MashTown, U.S.G. and artists such as Giggs, K Koke, Sneakbo and Nines. The genre came to the fore as a backlash against the perceived commercialisation of grime in the mid-late 2000s in London. The genre came to prominence around 2007 with the rise of Giggs. Road rap retained the explicit depictions of violence and British gang culture found in some early grime music and combines it with a musical style more similar to American gangsta rap than the sound system influenced music of grime, dubstep, UK garage, jungle, reggae and dub.\n\nGangs played a large part in the genre, with gangs such as Star Gang (formed by former Tottenham Mandem members), the Peckham Boys based in Peckham (with its various sets such as SN1, PYG, and OPB) and GAS Gang, based in Brixton, becoming notable in the road rap scene during the 2000s.\n\nThe road rap scene centres around mixtape releases and YouTube videos with some of the genres more popular acts getting mainstream recognition. The genre has been criticised for the relentless nihilism and violence in its lyrics as well as its links to gangs and gun crime with many rappers serving prison sentences. In keeping with grime, road rap has suffered from pre-emptive policing with Giggs claiming that the Metropolitan Police have set out to deny him the opportunity to make a living from music having banned him from touring. In 2011, Stigs was served the first ever gang injunction that banned him from rapping about anything that may encourage violence.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the American genre drill began to emerge in the UK, pushed by groups such as 150, 67, and Section Boyz. UK drill has been referred to as subgenre of road rap due to the influence it's had on the genre. Road rap also went on to influence afroswing, which emerged in the mid-2010s.\n\nSee also\n List of gangsta rap artists\n List of criminal enterprises, gangs, and syndicates\n Narcocorrido\n Road rap\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n\n \nHip hop genres\nCriticism of hip-hop\nHardcore hip hop\nAmerican styles of music\nMusic of New York City\nMusic of New York (state)\nMusic of California\nCompton, California\nAfrican-American culture\n1980s in music\n1990s in music\n2000s in music\n2010s in music\n2020s in music\nMusic controversies\nObscenity controversies in music\n1980s fads and trends\n1990s fads and trends\n2000s fads and trends\n2010s fads and trends\n2020s fads and trends", "machine_abstract": "Gangsta Rap is the genre of hip hop music that emerged in Los Angeles, California during the 1980s and became popular throughout much of the United States by 1990.

{"id": "An Inconvenient Tax", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%20Inconvenient%20Tax", "title": "An Inconvenient Tax", "text": "An Inconvenient Tax is a 2010 documentary film produced by Life Is My Movie Entertainment. The film explores the history of the income tax in the United States and the causes of its many complexities.\n\nSynopsis\nAn Inconvenient Tax examines the Federal Income Tax and how Congress uses the complex tax code to achieve political goals that are unrelated to raising revenue. The result of 95 years of additions, subtractions, deductions, and exclusions, the 62,000 page tax code is so complex that many are voicing their desire to greatly simplify it or to even completely remove it. Currently, tax revenue cannot even pay for government spending. The film follows the progression of taxation through wars, economic booms, and significant presidencies in U.S. history. An Inconvenient Tax includes commentary from some of the nation's best-known economic experts, commentators, and political voices. Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, Steve Forbes, Joseph Thorndike, Mike Huckabee, Charles Rossotti, David Walker, Neal Boortz, Herman Cain, Michael Graetz, Daniel Shaviro, Leonard Burman, and others discuss perceived problems in the American tax code, and also suggest possible changes. The possible solutions discussed include the FairTax, flat tax, and value added tax (VAT).\n\nAn Inconvenient Tax was officially released on Tax Day – April 15, 2010.\n\nPress\nOn April 11, 2011, Life Is My Movie Entertainment announced that An Inconvenient Tax had been acquired by Gravitas Ventures and would be distributed through cable, satellite, telco, and online Video-on-Demand (VOD) in June of that year.\nOn July 4, 2011, LIMM announced that the film would be available for international release through Octapixx Worldwide.\n\nReception\nThe film received positive reviews from mainly right-leaning critics. The Swash, a libertarian news site, called the film a “must see, especially to those who are actually ignorant of what it really is, how it came to be and how it should be.” Another conservative critic said that it was a great way to “learn quite a bit in a fairly enjoyable fashion.” Director Christopher P. Marshall and producer Vincent Vittorio were interviewed on FOX Business Channel’s Stossel show with John Stossel on April 15, 2011.\n\nSee also\n Consumption Tax\n Income Tax\n IRS\n Tax Policy Center\n Tax Reform\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Fix the Tax\n\n2010 films\nAmerican films\nEnglish-language films\nAmerican independent films\nAmerican documentary films\nDocumentary films about economics\n2010 documentary films\n2010 independent films", "machine_abstract": "The film is about the global warming crisis and its effects on our planet, as well as solutions to it.\nIt was directed by Al Gore's former campaign manager Davis Guggenheim (An American Life) who also wrote the script along with Mark B.

{"id": "Harriet Ward", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet%20Ward", "title": "Harriet Ward", "text": "Harriet Ward née Tidy (1808 – 1873), was a British writer whose work is sometimes thought of as South African literature. She lived in the Cape Colony for a few years and her best-known books are set there: the non-fiction Five Years in Kaffirland and the fictional Jasper Lyle, the first English novel set entirely in South Africa. She also wrote articles for a military audience, unusually for a woman of that era. Her writing has stimulated discussion about whether or not she agreed fully with British colonial attitudes.\n\nPersonal life \nShe was born at Thorp, Norfolk in 1808 to Colonel and Mrs Francis Skelly Tidy, née Miss Pinder, daughter of the Chief Justice of Barbados. After school in France and London she married John Ward in 1831. He was a military officer from Waterford, Ireland and his wife accompanied him on various postings. They had one daughter, Isabel. The family lived together on St Helena in the late 1830s. In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called \"Ceded Territory\". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.\n\nWriting\n\nHer first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in \"Kaffirland\", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.\n\nThis book was well-received in a period of public interest in the \"Kaffir War\" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was \"encumbered\" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as \"truthful and popular\" with a \"fidelity and vivacity\" in its descriptions of \"Kaffir life and scenery\", \"giving it at the present moment an especial interest\". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.\n\nCritics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as \"stridently propagandist\" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a \"veiled critique\" or even deliberately expressing \"anti-colonial dissidence\". One critic thinks she wrote at first with \"full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier\" but later revealed a \"startling mismatch\" with this in her novels.\n\nSelect bibliography\n\nBooks available online \n\n  Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country, to the conclusion of peace.

The lockout would be resolved on July 13 when an agreement was reached in principle.  The lockout officially ended on July 22 when the owners ratified the agreement, ending the 310-day labour stoppage.\nOn October 5, the puck dropped to open the 2005–06 NHL season in 15 cities, as for the first time in NHL history, all 30 teams were in action on the same night.  The NHL also introduced a new, modernized logo, and implemented several rule changes, most notably the shoot out as part of the league's relaunch.\n\nCanadian Hockey League\nThe 2005 Memorial Cup was won by the London Knights, who defeated the Rimouski Océanic 4–0 in the final held at London, Ontario.\nOntario Hockey League: The London Knights defeated the Ottawa 67's to capture the J. Ross Robertson Cup, the first championship in the Knights' 40-year history.\nQuebec Major Junior Hockey League: The Rimouski Océanic captured their first President's Cup by defeating the Halifax Mooseheads.\nWestern Hockey League: The Kelowna Rockets won their second President's Cup in three years by defeating the Brandon Wheat Kings.\nThe London Knights broke the CHL record for longest undefeated streak, going 31 games (29-0-2) without a loss to begin the season.  The previous record was 29 games, held by the WHL's Brandon Wheat Kings.\nThe Calgary Hitmen took advantage of the NHL's labour stoppage to shatter the WHL and CHL attendance records, drawing 362,227 fans.  Their per-game average of 10,062 was the highest average of any North American professional or junior team.\n\nInternational Hockey\nThe Czech Republic defeated Canada 3–0 to win the gold medal at the 2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.  Russia won the bronze.\nThe United States defeated Canada 1–0 in a shoot out to win the gold medal in the 2005 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships.  Sweden won the bronze.  The result was sharply criticized in Canada, where many felt that using the shoot out in the final cheapened the tournament.  It was commonly noted that Canada did not allow a single goal in the entire tournament, yet did not win the gold medal.\nCanada ended a seven-year drought by winning the gold medal at the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in one of the most dominating performances in tournament history. Russia won the silver, and the Czech Republic won the bronze in the tournament held at Grand Forks, North Dakota.\n\nEuropean Hockey\nRussian Hockey Super League: The Russian national championship was captured by HC Dynamo Moscow.\nElitserien: Frölunda HC captured the Swedish Elite League title.\nSM-liiga: Kärpät won their second consecutive Finnish national championship.\nDeutsche Eishockey Liga: Eisbären Berlin won the German national championship.\n\nMinor League hockey\nAmerican Hockey League: The Philadelphia Phantoms won the Calder Cup, defeating the Chicago Wolves.\nECHL: The Trenton Titans won the Kelly Cup.\nUnited Hockey League: The Muskegon Fury captured their second consecutive Colonial Cup.\nCentral Hockey League: The Colorado Eagles won the Ray Miron President's Cup.\n\nJunior A hockey\nCanadian Junior A Hockey League:The Weyburn Red Wings of the SJHL defeated the Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL to win the 2005 Royal Bank Cup as Canadian \"Junior A\" national champions.\nUnited States Hockey League:The Cedar Rapids Roughriders captured the Clark Cup.\n\nWomen's ice hockey\nThe Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey program defeated the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey in the 2005 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament.", "machine_abstract": "See also main page:: 2005-06 NHL season.\nMajor events of the year included the World Championships, IIHF World Championship and Olympic Games.

{"id": "Regular complex polygon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular%20complex%20polygon", "title": "Regular complex polygon", "text": "In geometry, a regular complex polygon is a generalization of a regular polygon in real space to an analogous structure in a complex Hilbert space, where each real dimension is accompanied by an imaginary one. A regular polygon exists in 2 real dimensions, , while a complex polygon exists in two complex dimensions, , which can be given real representations in 4 dimensions, , which then must be projected down to 2 or 3 real dimensions to be visualized. A complex polygon is generalized as a complex polytope in .\n\nA complex polygon may be understood as a collection of complex points, lines, planes, and so on, where every point is the junction of multiple lines, every line of multiple planes, and so on.\n\nThe regular complex polygons have been completely characterized, and can be described using a symbolic notation developed by Coxeter.\n\nRegular complex polygons\nWhile 1-polytopes can have unlimited p, finite regular complex polygons, excluding the double prism polygons p{4}2, are limited to 5-edge (pentagonal edges) elements, and infinite regular aperiogons also include 6-edge (hexagonal edges) elements.\n\nNotations\n\nShephard's modified Schläfli notation\n\nShephard originally devised a modified form of Schläfli's notation for regular polytopes. For a polygon bounded by p1-edges, with a p2-set as vertex figure and overall symmetry group of order g, we denote the polygon as p1(g)p2.\n\nThe number of vertices V is then g/p2 and the number of edges E is g/p1.\n\nThe complex polygon illustrated above has eight square edges (p1=4) and sixteen vertices (p2=2). From this we can work out that g = 32, giving the modified Schläfli symbol 4(32)2.\n\nCoxeter's revised modified Schläfli notation\n\nA more modern notation p1{q}p2 is due to Coxeter, and is based on group theory. As a symmetry group, its symbol is p1[q]p2.\n\nThe symmetry group p1[q]p2 is represented by 2 generators R1, R2, where: R1p1 = R2p2 = I. If q is even, (R2R1)q/2 = (R1R2)q/2. If q is odd, (R2R1)(q−1)/2R2 = (R1R2)(q−1)/2R1. When q is odd, p1=p2.\n\nFor 4[4]2 has R14 = R22 = I, (R2R1)2 = (R1R2)2.\n\nFor 3[5]3 has R13 = R23 = I, (R2R1)2R2 = (R1R2)2R1.\n\nCoxeter–Dynkin diagrams\n\nCoxeter also generalised the use of Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams to complex polytopes, for example the complex polygon p{q}r is represented by  and the equivalent symmetry group, p[q]r, is a ringless diagram . The nodes p and r represent mirrors producing p and r images in the plane. Unlabeled nodes in a diagram have implicit 2 labels. For example, a real regular polygon is 2{q}2 or {q} or .\n\nOne limitation, nodes connected by odd branch orders must have identical node orders. If they do not, the group will create \"starry\" polygons, with overlapping element. So  and  are ordinary, while  is starry.\n\n12 Irreducible Shephard groups\n\nCoxeter enumerated this list of regular complex polygons in . A regular complex polygon, p{q}r or , has p-edges, and r-gonal vertex figures. p{q}r is a finite polytope if (p + r)q > pr(q − 2).\n\nIts symmetry is written as p[q]r, called a Shephard group, analogous to a Coxeter group, while also allowing unitary reflections.\n\nFor nonstarry groups, the order of the group p[q]r can be computed as .\n\nThe Coxeter number for p[q]r is  , so the group order can also be computed as . A regular complex polygon can be drawn in orthogonal projection with h-gonal symmetry.\n\nThe rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are: \n\nExcluded solutions with odd q and unequal p and r are: 6[3]2, 6[3]3, 9[3]3, 12[3]3, ..., 5[5]2, 6[5]2, 8[5]2, 9[5]2, 4[7]2, 9[5]2, 3[9]2, and 3[11]2.\n\nOther whole q with unequal p and r, create starry groups with overlapping fundamental domains: , , , , , and .\n\nThe dual polygon of p{q}r is r{q}p. A polygon of the form p{q}p is self-dual. Groups of the form p[2q]2 have a half symmetry p[q]p, so a regular polygon  is the same as quasiregular . As well, regular polygon with the same node orders, , have an alternated construction , allowing adjacent edges to be two different colors.\n\nThe group order, g, is used to compute the total number of vertices and edges. It will have g/r vertices, and g/p edges. When p=r, the number of vertices and edges are equal. This condition is required when q is odd.\n\nMatrix generators \nThe group p[q]r, , can be represented by two matrices:\n\nWith\n \n\nExamples\n\nEnumeration of regular complex polygons \nCoxeter enumerated the complex polygons in Table III of Regular Complex Polytopes.\n\nVisualizations of regular complex polygons\n\n2D graphs\nPolygons of the form p{2r}q can be visualized by q color sets of p-edge. Each p-edge is seen as a regular polygon, while there are no faces.\n\nComplex polygons 2{r}q\n\nPolygons of the form 2{4}q are called generalized orthoplexes. They share vertices with the 4D q-q duopyramids, vertices connected by 2-edges. \n\nComplex polygons p{4}2\n\nPolygons of the form p{4}2 are called generalized hypercubes (squares for polygons). They share vertices with the 4D p-p duoprisms, vertices connected by p-edges. Vertices are drawn in green, and p-edges are drawn in alternate colors, red and blue. The perspective is distorted slightly for odd dimensions to move overlapping vertices from the center.\n\nComplex polygons p{r}2\n\nComplex polygons, p{r}p\n\nPolygons of the form p{r}p have equal number of vertices and edges. They are also self-dual.\n\n3D perspective \n\n3D perspective projections of complex polygons p{4}2 can show the point-edge structure of a complex polygon, while scale is not preserved. \n\nThe duals 2{4}p: are seen by adding vertices inside the edges, and adding edges in place of vertices.\n\nQuasiregular polygons \nA quasiregular polygon is a truncation of a regular polygon. A quasiregular polygon  contains alternate edges of the regular polygons  and . The quasiregular polygon has p vertices on the p-edges of the regular form.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Coxeter, H. S.

Little except ruins remain of the palace. However, the parts that still stand display amazing works of sculpture and exquisite carvings.\n\nHistory of the Shahi Qila states that it was originally built by the Farooqui rulers and resided by Shah Jahan, at a time when he was the governor of Burhanpur. Shah Jahan became so fond of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the first three years of his ascending the throne. Shah Jahan spent a considerable time in this city, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila.\n \nThe Shahi Qila, Burhanpur is mostly in ruins now, except a few beautifully carved parts of the palace that still stands as a symbol of the glorious Qila it was in the olden days. The locals call the Shahi Qila 'Bhulbhulaya' (that means a labyrinth) because the architecture of the Shahi Qila is puzzling and perplexing for a casual visitor.\n \nThe main attraction at the palace is the hamam or the royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, Begum Mumtaz Mahal, so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath in water scented with khus, saffron and rose petals. Hammam Khana was constructed during Mughal Period. The baths bear an inscription of Khan Khana Mirza Abdul Rahim Khana, the famous minister of Akbar and Jahangir. The rooms have domed roof. The Hammam is beautifully decorated with paintings on honey comb work. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. One of the amazing facts is that the Taj Mahal was originally supposed to have been built at Burhanpur. The site chosen for it still lies vacant near the tapti river. Mumtaz, in whose memory the Taj Mahal was built, died in burhanpur while giving birth to her fourteenth child.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Burhanpur Historical City\n Burhanpur Gateway to South India\n\n \nForts in Madhya Pradesh\n\nbn:বুরহানপুর\nca:Burhanpur", "machine_abstract": "The Shahi dynasty was the ruling family of the Maratha Empire from 1628 to 1818 and ruled over parts of present-day India including Gujarat (1628–1658), Kathiawar (1658–1724) and Rajasthan (1724–1818).

It was formed in 1974 from the merger of former Jesuit schools of philosophy at Lyon-Fourvière and philosophy at Chantilly. It is no longer restricted to Jesuits but welcomes men and women, lay and religious.\n\nStudies\nFollowing the Apostolic Constitution of Pope John Paul II on Catholic Universities and Ecclesiastical Faculties (Sapientia Christiana) of April 15, 1979, and the ordinances of the Congregation for Catholic Education, the canonical statutes of the Centre were approved by Rome on June 18, 1986. The licentiate, master's degree, and PhD are offered in both philosophy and theology.\nThe school of philosophy includes special emphases on aesthetics, biomedical ethics, and public ethics and international perspectivesFurthermore it hosts the Ricci Institute of Chinese Studies. The school of theology includes studies in ancient languages and patristics, religions and cultures, and spirituality and the religious life.\n\nThere are approximately 250 students from 40 nations in the degree programmes along with around 1,750 auditors, with many from the United States. There are about 40 regular and 90 guest lecturers, from several European countries.\n\nThe Centre organizes conferences on various topics, such as \"Islam and Christianity: what dialogue is possible?\" and \"Called in the heart of the world with the heart of God\" on secular institutes, along with symposia – \"The Jesuits Today\".\n\nLibrary and publications\nThe centre's library and its stocks in  Vanves comprise 190,000 volumes and 850 periodicals, many in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, including manuscripts and printed books from the 16th through 18th centuries. Most of the books are works on theology – Biblical exegesis, fundamental and dogmatic theology, new theological currents, interreligious dialogue, ecumenism, morality and ethics, spirituality, history of religions, church history, history of religious orders – and philosophy  – ancient, modern, and contemporary. The Jesuit collection contains over 40,000 volumes on Ignatian spirituality and Jesuit history, many of them original editions. There is also a reference room with 7,000 volumes.\n\nThe Centre publishes two journals, Recherches de sciences religieuses and Archives de philosophie and has its own publishing house.\n\nSee also\n List of Jesuit sites\n\nReferences  \n\nSeminaries and theological colleges in France\nEducational institutions established in 1974\nJesuit universities and colleges", "machine_abstract": "Centre Sèvres is the Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Catholic University in Paris, France.\nThe Centre was founded by Pope Pius X on September 29th 1910 as \"Seminarium pro Nobis et alios\" (Seminary for Us and Others) to train priests from all over Europe who were fleeing persecution during World War I.

{"id": "Hohenfels-Essingen", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenfels-Essingen", "title": "Hohenfels-Essingen", "text": "Hohenfels-Essingen is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nGeography \n\nThe municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588 m), the Alter Voß (588 m, with “Liberation Beech”) and the Mühlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).\n\nHistory \nAs witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.\n\nRomans and Franks \nIn the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier.\n\nIn the district Im Keller (“In the Cellar”) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.\n\nThe great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the “army kings’” (Heerkönige) hands. The people who had lived here until now – Romanized Celts and Romans – either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.\n\n15th to 17th centuries \nEven before the Thirty Years' War, the Mühlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain’s south slope.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the Mühlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.\n\n18th and 19th centuries \nAs a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one.\n\nIn November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat  in Düsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War.\n\nIn 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit – the Feuerberg in Hohenfels – was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.\n\n20th century to present \n\nAfter the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland.\n\nIn the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the Mühlenberg. In the area around Hohenfels, a firm from Mayen was making runner stones and shipping them worldwide. In 1928 above the cadastral area of “Wahlend”, a gravelworks was built, remaining in operation until 1974. For a time, more than 100 people were employed here.\n\nIn the course of administrative reform, the two self-administering municipalities of Hohenfels and Essingen were merged on 1 January 1968 into a single municipality.\n\nPolitics\n\nMunicipal council \nThe council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nCoat of arms \nThe German blazon reads: In Silber ein schräglinkes, rotes Schwert, begleitet oben von einer blauen Urne, unten von einem grünen Mühlstein.\n\nThe municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a sword bendwise sinister gules, the point to chief, between an urn azure and a millstone vert.\n\nThe red sword stands for the execution place of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun between Hohenfels and Essingen on the old Roman road, marked on the map of the Amt of Daun in 1683 with a gallows symbol. The blue urn refers to the great Frankish burying ground with 125 graves and the important finds therefrom. The green millstone refers to the Hohenfels millstone quarry, already widely known in the Middle Ages, and further for the landscape in both constituent centres, which is characterized by volcanism, and where there is even today lava and basalt quarrying.\n\nCulture and sightseeing \n The grotto at the Mühlenberg\n Millstone caves\n Basalt deposits\n Hiking trails\n\nBuildings\n\nEssingen \n Saint Hubert’s Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Hubertus), Bergstraße 10, biaxial aisleless church, 1886.\n Bergstraße 1 – Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), from 1783, old cobbles in yard.\n Bergstraße 2 – house from 1816, commercial building, some old cobbles in yard, whole complex.\n Wayside cross, southwest of the village on the road to Rockeskyll, cast-iron crucifix, about 1900.\n Wayside cross, west of the village at a hairpin bend in the road, a basalt beam cross from 1749 (?).\n\nHohenfels \n Catholic church, Gerolsteiner Straße 6, four-axis Gothic Revival aisleless church from 1894.\n Before Am Mühlenberg 6 – wayside cross, basalt shaft cross from 1687.\n Schulstraße, graveyard, warriors’ memorial 1914–1918, Crucifixion group, praying soldier, from 1922.\n Wayside cross, north of the village at the Mühlenberg at the lower hairpin bend, basalt shaft cross from 1719.\n\nClubs \n Freizeit- und Sportverein Hohenfels-Essingen e.V.

{"id": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean%20Method%20of%20Memorization", "title": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization", "text": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization (PYMOM), also known as Triangular Movement Cycle (TMC), is a game-based, educational methodology or associative-learning technique that primarily uses corresponding information, such as terms and definitions on opposing sides, displayed on cue cards, to exploit psychological retention of information for academic study and language acquisition. PYMOM is named such because of the shape the cue-cards form during the progression of the game, a right-angled or Pythagorean triangle.\n\nIt is a theoretical educational method that is made up of several established and tested educational methods that have been in use for decades.\n\nMethodology\nPYMOM is a composite body of techniques that claims, in its digital form, to incorporate (to a greater or lesser degree): spaced repetition, non-failure redundant subroutine, chromatics, positive reinforcement, the Von Restorff effect, picture association, selective musical tonality, kinesthetics, the serial-position effect and meditation. There are two branches of this methodology:\nthe historical, physical incarnation, the Triangular Movement Cycle and\nthe digitized version, incorporating the significant addition of the aforementioned educational methods and theories, Pythagorean Method of Memorization.\n\nProcess & application\nAs with both branches, there is only one variable in the game or learning method: a correct or incorrect answer. The initial movement cycle also remains largely unchanged.\n\nThe movement cycle which is most crucial to the methodology and reinforces the spaced repetition, begins with either 3, 4 or 5 cards; 3 cards for a 6-card session, 4 cards for a 10-card session and 5 cards for the most advanced 15-card session. Because two-sided associative cue-cards are being used, all cards are presented with a congruent side up, either all \"terms\" or \"definitions,\" not mixed.\n\nOnce cards have been answered correctly, the predominant row has reached its maximum and a card must be graduated out of this row to continue the game. Thus the card to the far right comes into play.  Routines are repeated as each row reaches its maximum. A cue-card is finally eliminated from the game session by being answered correctly once more, after it has graduated to the top tier or row.\n\nTriangular Movement Cycle\n\nThe first manifestation, referred to as the \"Triangular Movement Cycle\" or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a manual movement cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student. This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers — and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort — and was very time consuming.\n\nThe term \"Pythagorean Method of Memorization\" was coined in 2013 and officially copyrighted in October 2014 by a Canadian company named You Learn Educational Solutions & Linguistics Inc. PYMOM takes the movement cycle from TMC and remedied the challenge of teaching the movement cycle itself to students by providing a software-based solution to handling cycles by means of sub-routines prompted by the user’s input.\n\nPYMOM wove established educational theory into the fabric of TMC to create a viable educational platform for academic and linguistic study by several means. Because spaced repetition is intrinsically part of the movement-cycle subroutines, it adds to the content and surrounding experience making it into a platform. The developers of PYMOM describe it as an “organic learning experience.” The tenets that truly allow a learning system to be a PYMOM-based system are enumerated thusly: The Von Restorff effect: for example, where it features a language, this method is employed to further aid in memory retention of the highlighted word in the phrase.\n\nChromatics: there are no white backgrounds where learning takes place.\nPositive Reinforcement: There are no truly \"wrong\" responses, only mistakes. These mistakes are greeted by neutral reinforcement and \"correct\" responses are rewarded with positive reinforcement.\nPicture Association: Visual aids should accompany concept-based material.\nSelective Musical Tonality: the learning experience should always incorporate music; generally instrumental, that aids learning by increasing focus and reducing stress (which inhibits learning).\nKinesthetics: whether by utilizing a touch-screen, key board or mouse, a level of physical movement should always be present while learning to further increase retention.\nThe Serial Position Effect: taking breaks at specific, regular intervals to aid in learning and reduce stress levels.\nMeditation: a session of meditation should be incorporated into every learning session to allow for further retention of the information.\n\nReferences\n\nLearning methods\nCognitive training", "machine_abstract": "The Pythagoras method is one way to memorize the multiplication table, and it can be used in other ways as well.\nIt consists of:  The first step is to write down all numbers from 1 up to 12 on separate pieces of paper (or cards).

Now that you've grouped your numbers by square value it's time to learn how they are related to each other within those groups.  \nGroup 1:    1 + 4 = 5,    4 + 16 = 20,   25 - 49 = -16,  81 + 64 = 145,   100 - 64 = 36,   64 + 81 = 155,   160 - 125 = 45,   144 + 216 = 361,   343 - 162 = 181,   512 - 216 = 295,   729 - 256 = 483  \nGroup 2:    2 + 8 = 10,    8 + 27 = 35,   64 + 128 = 192,   125 + 216 = 341,   216 + 343 = 509,   512 + 486 = 1023,   1024 - 819 = 191,   2048 - 1536 = 291", "prompt": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"{title}\".

It was created by Elena Ochoa Foster, founder of Ivorypress and is published twice yearly. It comes in two different editions, English/Chinese and Spanish/Japanese and is designed by Oscar Mariné creator of Pedro Almodóvar's movie posters.\n\nDescription\nWith a hardback cover and 300 pages, C International resembles a book more than a magazine. The magazine emphasizes design and aims to replicate the white walls and neutral background of an art gallery, with no interfering text in its central pages. Its creator said 'It would be extremely provincial to do it just in English,' and noted 'First I thought we would make it half in English and half in Spanish. Then I began to go to China a lot, and after discovering many  photographers there, I knew a magazine like C Photo would have a following. I am convinced that Asia is the future'.\n\nThe publisher of C International is Ivory Press.\n\nMagazine sections\nWithin the core photographic pages, each issue has sub-sections: Collector, Archive, Scope, Portfolio, C Action, Vintage and Guest.\n\nIn every issue the magazine publishes a private or public photographic collection alongside an interview with the owner or responsible curator of the collection in order to better understand the criteria behind the collection.\n\nThe archive section sheds light on previously unpublished or unknown works, such as those of Isamu Noguchi, and Francis Bacon, and archives the charting  history of cities such as London and Shanghai.\n\nThis section provides an eclectic view of the world of international image making. Scope shows a selection of contemporary artists. It aims to illustrate the creative pulse of contemporary photography.\n\nPortfolio presents works created by contemporary photographers. Some of them comprise recent and unpublished works, while others live alongside previous series that help to bring each artist's work into context and to outline their evolution over the last few years.\n\nC Photo Magazine has established an initiative to promote the creation of contemporary photography. In each issue two artists are commissioned for a series that is published exclusively in this section of the magazine. The authors are awarded a cash grant as a contribution to the production of a portfolio that is made up of a minimum of six photographs. An edition of up to four copies is made from these works.\n\nThe series created in this way for the C Action initiative has become part of C International Photo Magazine's Collection of Contemporary Photography, and will  be gradually circulated both within its pages and through other media. The selection of participating artists is made by the editorial team of the magazine, in collaboration with various curators, gallery owners and photography specialists of both private and public institutions. The selected artists' profiles are not subject to any prior conditions including geographical origin or subject matter of the work presented.\n\nThe legacy of the masters of photography is represented in the Vintage section.\n\nGuest\nIn each issue, C Photo Magazine invites a ‘guest’, generally from a creative field outside of photography, to reveal their most recent ventures into photography or how they use it in their creative processes. This section approaches photography from a different angle, and as a result, reveals the multi-faceted nature of this medium. Wim Wenders, Brian Eno, Bill Viola and Marina Abramović are amongst guest collaborators.\n\nThe publication is predominantly devoted to photography. Included within its opening pages, however, are a number of essays by renowned writers, philosophers and artists who explore a wide range of viewpoints about the role and significance of photography.\n\nC International Photo Magazine ultimately intends to create an encyclopaedia of photography, one that can be used as a source of reference for years to come.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n official webpage C International Photo Magazine\n\nBiannual magazines published in the United Kingdom\nMagazines established in 2006\nMultilingual magazines\nPhotography magazines\n2006 establishments in the United Kingdom\nMagazines published in London", "machine_abstract": "C International Photo Magazine is the first international photo magazine in China, which was founded by Chinese and American photographers in 2002.\nThe magazine has been published every two months since its founding until now.

Williams House is a historic brick house located at 3 Plain Street in Taunton, Massachusetts. Built in about 1830, it is a prominent and rare example of Federal period architecture in the city's Weir Village neighborhood.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Francis D. Williams House is prominently sited, standing just beyond the eastern end of Taunton's Plain Street Bridge across the Taunton River, on a triangular parcel bounded by Plain, Water, and Berkley Streets. It is a large -story brick building, with a side-gable roof pierced by two gabled dormers and a central brick chimney stack. The facade facing toward the bridge is eight bays wide, evenly spaced and all filled with sash windows that have granite sills and lintels. The entrances are on the side facades, facing toward Berkley and Plain Streets; these are five bays wide, with the entrances at the centers, framed by paneled surrounds. A five-bay two-story brick ell extends to the main block's rear.\n\nThe house was built circa 1830, when the Weir Village area where it stands was a thriving seaport and industrial area. It is one of Taunton's only brick Greek Revival houses, was probably built by Francis Williams, member of a prominent local family involved in sea trade. Its size suggest that it may have been used by the Williams family to board sailors involved in the coasting trade.\n\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 5, 1984.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Taunton, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nNational Register of Historic Places in Taunton, Massachusetts\nHouses in Taunton, Massachusetts\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Bristol County, Massachusetts", "machine_abstract": "The Francis D.

{"id": "Channel stuffing", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel%20stuffing", "title": "Channel stuffing", "text": "Channel stuffing is a business practice in which a company, or a sales force within a company, inflates its sales figures by forcing more products through a distribution channel than the channel is capable of selling.  Also known as trade loading, this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures.  Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly-managed sales force attempting to meet short-term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term.\n\nChannel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with the excess inventory, leads to costly overtime and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as the sales department works to make up for prior overselling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels, because salespeople no longer adequately qualify their prospects. \n\nOccasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing by their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. That is done by holding back on orders until the end of a supplier's quota period. The supplier's sales force then panic, and sell a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. That affects customers, creating gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. \n\nCorporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide the activity from their investors. In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in some cases litigated against such corporations, and private class-action suits have been filed.  Channel stuffing might also be part of a broader pattern of financial impropriety.\n\nReferences \n\nEthically disputed business practices\nMarketing techniques", "machine_abstract": "The term channel stuffing refers to the practice of broadcasting unwanted content over broadcast channels, such as television or radio stations.\nIn some countries this is illegal and can be prosecuted under laws against spamming (e.g., in Australia).", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Channel stuffing\".

{"id": "Hale Ranch", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale%20Ranch", "title": "Hale Ranch", "text": "The Hale Ranch is a working cattle ranch headquartered in the ghost town of Harshaw, in the Patagonia Mountains of southeastern Arizona.\n\nHistory\nHale Ranch was founded in 1915 by farmer and homesteader Richard Farrell, and was originally known as Dickey's Place. It later passed into the ownership of Farrell's grandson, Norman Hale, and has been used as a cattle ranch ever since. The headquarters is located in Harshaw and includes multiple historic buildings, associated outbuildings, and building foundations.\n\nThe most prominent of these is the James Finley House, a red brick and adobe structure originally used as the office for the Hermosa Mining Company. Because of its unusual construction—red bricks salvaged from a nearby mine—and its association with the early history of Harshaw, the James Finley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nAnother historic home located on the ranch is the Norman Hale Residence, an adobe house with a tin gabled roof, part of which dates back to the 1880s. Nearby is the Mary Hale Residence, another adobe house with a tin hipped roof, built around the same time as the others and locally referred to as the \"Lions Den\". Further down the road is the ruin of a third adobe building that was originally owned by Ignacio \"Nacho\" Arias, who used it as his home and a pool hall.\n\nIn addition to the old houses and outbuildings, there are the foundations of several historic structures. The most notable is that of the Hermosa Mill, which was originally built in the 1870s when mining operations began. Closer to the James Finley House is the concrete foundations of a two-room frame schoolhouse and a Catholic church built of volcanic tuff, both of which were built in the 1940s and torn down in the 1960s. A smaller rock alignment nearby was part of an assay office from the late 19th century.\n\nTwo small cemeteries are also located in the area. The main cemetery to the north of the Hale Ranch headquarters and the townsite is known locally as the \"Mexican cemetery\", because of the many Mexican-American pioneers buried in the cemetery. A short distance away is the \"American cemetery\", which is located on private property and contains the graves of American pioneers, among them Richard Farrell.\n\nA few miles to the east of the Hale Ranch headquarters is another historic ranch house owned by the Hale family. Located along the San Rafael Valley road, the home was originally the headquarters for the Ernest Best Ranch, and was used as a filming location for several Western films. The opening scene of the 1971 made-for-television film \"Wild Rovers\", starring William Holden and Ryan O'Neal, was shot in the living room of the ranch house.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nSee also\n\n San Rafael Ranch\n\nReferences\n\nRanches in Arizona\n1915 establishments in Arizona\nBuildings and structures in Santa Cruz County, Arizona", "machine_abstract": "The Hale Ranch is located in the Santa Clara Valley, California and was founded by George Hales (1845–1928) of San Francisco as a dairy farm.

In 1921 he joined Éamon de Valera's anti-treaty forces and remained a critic of partition until his death. He was interned and on his release was appointed Chief Organiser of Sinn Féin.\n\nWhile living in Newry, Donnelly was elected as an independent republican member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the Armagh constituency at the 1925 general election.  Shortly after his election, he was served with an order excluding him from Northern Ireland.  No official reason was given for the granting of this order.\n\nIn 1926, he became a founder member of Fianna Fáil. Donnelly was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Leix–Offaly constituency at the 1933 general election. He did not contest the 1937 general election.  He also served as Director of Elections for Fianna Fáil.\n\nIn 1938, Donnelly visited his wife's house near Newry, and was imprisoned in Belfast Prison, before being given a choice between paying a fine of £25 or returning to prison. Again, no reason for his imprisonment and exclusion was revealed.  That year, he stood for election to the 2nd Seanad, but was not successful.\n\nIn 1942, Donnelly was again elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, this time in a by-election for Belfast Falls.  He did not take his seat.\nHe died in 1944.\n\nReferences\n\n1877 births\n1944 deaths\nFianna Fáil TDs\nMembers of the 8th Dáil\nMembers of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1925–1929\nMembers of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1938–1945\nMembers of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for County Armagh constituencies\nMembers of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for Belfast constituencies", "machine_abstract": "Eamon Donnelly (born in Dublin, Ireland) is the current President of The Irish Film Institute and former Director General at RTÉ Television Network.\nDonnelly was born on 1 May 1957 to parents from County Mayo who emigrated to Dublin after World War II.

John Bannerman always treasured his Highland heritage and was a native Gaelic speaker.  Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy and Glasgow High School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to Balliol College, Oxford and later to Cornell University in the United States.\n\nIn 1931 he married Ray Mundell and they had two sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was the Liberal Democrat MP, Ray Michie (later Baroness Michie of Gallanach). The historian John Bannerman was his son, and Donald Shade Munro, the rugby player and coach was his grandson.\n\nRugby union\n\nSchool and College Rugby\n\nBannerman started playing rugby union while at school, and between 1919–20, he was captain of Glasgow High School's 1st XV.\n\nBannerman was an accomplished sportsman winning a \"rugby blue\" at Oxford\n\nProvincial career\n\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1922 inter-city match.\n\nInternational career\n\nHe won 37 caps for Scotland, playing in all that country's internationals between 1921 and 1929 and was Scotland's most capped player until 1962 when Hugh McLeod surpassed his total. He played in Scotland's first “grand slam” winning team in 1925, securing this achievement by beating England in the opening match of the new Murrayfield Stadium. In 1926 he played in the Scotland team that beat England at Twickenham and France in Paris, a feat that no Scottish team would repeat until 2021, 95 years later.\n\nHe went on to become Glasgow HSFP's most capped player.\n\nAdministrative career\n\nIn 1954–55, Bannerman served as President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\n\nCareer\nIn 1930, Bannerman was appointed as a farm manager on land owned by the Duke of Montrose. In 1952 Bannerman left the Montrose estate to become a farmer in his own interests and also that year became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Festival of Britain.\n\nPolitics\nBannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. From 1942 to 1957 he was a Forestry Commissioner. In 1938 he was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Argyll. When the seat fell vacant in 1940 it was mooted that Bannerman might run as a Liberal National but the negotiations with the Conservatives broke down robbing him of his best chance of entering the House of Commons. He contested Argyll unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election and Inverness in 1950. But in 1954 he was the candidate in an extraordinary by-election at Inverness which some historians have seen as a true turning point in Liberal fortunes in Scotland and perhaps the United Kingdom. From a position where there had been no Liberal candidate in the 1951 election, Bannerman jumped into second place over Labour, coming just 1331 votes behind the Tory winner. This was the best Liberal by-election performance since the war. At the general election of 1955, Bannerman came even closer, losing by just 966 votes. Although his vote share declined in the 1959 general election, the ground had been laid for a successful attack on the seat in the 1964 general election by Russell Johnston, who held the seat until he retired from the Commons in 1997.\n\nBannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1954 to 1964 and Rector of Aberdeen University in 1957. He made other attempts to enter the Commons, including giving Labour a close run at the Paisley by-election of 1961, registering 41.3% of the vote in a seat where there had been no Liberal candidate at the 1959 general election. He tried again without success at Paisley at the 1964 general election but in December 1967 he was made Baron Bannerman of Kildonan, of Kildonan in the County of Sutherland, and so finally entered Parliament.\n\nLife peerage\nBannerman was one of three Liberals to be made life peers in 1967; the others were Tim Beaumont and John Foot. Their appointments were attacked by the Young Liberals as undemocratic. One particular critic was Tony Greaves, then editor of the Young Liberal publication Gunfire, who argued that as the Liberal Party was in favour of a new social and political order, it was quite wrong to participate in the most pathetic feature of the existing order, the House of Lords. (Greaves would become Baron Greaves of Pendle in 2000).\n\nIn his maiden speech in the Lords, Bannerman took up the Scottish cause, referring to the anger of Hamilton where the Scottish National Party had just won a parliamentary by-election; and warning it was the anger of two centuries in which the Scots had been a \"sleeping partner\" in the United Kingdom political scene.\n\nGaelic culture\nIn 1922 he won the prestigious gold medal for solo singing at the Royal National Mòd in Fort William. He was President of An Comunn Gàidhealach, the national Gaelic Society, a position previously held by his father,  from 1949 to 1954.\n\nDeath \nHe died in Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969 aged 67.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Bath, Richard (ed.)

She married computer salesman Ben O'Sullivan, in 2003 at Lickey, Worcestershire. Manners revealed in an interview that the two had divorced in 2009. She said, \"We spent 10 years together and are still close. He's a lovely man\".\n\nCareer\nManners began her career in 1997, appearing in one episode of the BBC soap opera EastEnders. In 2000, Manners received the role of Joanna Helm in the BBC soap opera Doctors. Of her role she said, \"I got the best storylines in the world in Doctors, my nan died of a brain tumour then it came out I killed her. I went mad and was addicted to anti-depressants, forged signatures and tried to kill myself\". She later went on to appear in K.C. Gregory in Sky One's Mile High and Bex Reynolds in the BBC medical drama Casualty. In 2004, it was announced that Manners was to participate in the second series of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. She was paired with dancer Brendan Cole and the pair finished in sixth place. She starred in a reconstruction for a documentary called True Crime Stories: Tracie Andrews – Blood on her hands. She played Tracie Andrews alongside James Daffern in 2002.\n\nManners appeared in ITV1's The Bill, as Kirsty Knight. After six months on-screen it was announced that the show was to be cancelled. Of this she said, \"I’m heartbroken. Not just for myself, but for everyone on the show. It’s a real loss for the industry. Everyone is really upset about it\". All the big wigs came down to break the news to us at a meeting. We knew straight away when we saw the look on their faces. But what can you do? C’est la vie! I’ve had a fabulous time and we’re trying to remain positive. We’ve enjoyed every last minute of filming and had a laugh. I'm proud to be part of the last cast of The Bill\". Of her time on the show she said, \"I loved all the action and the stunts on The Bill, and the subject matter – it’s a lot more serious than some of the TV I’ve done. In Casualty I had a rape storyline, but mainly I’ve been the light relief, so this has been a nice change\".\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nEnglish television actresses\nEnglish soap opera actresses\nAlumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama\nActresses from Birmingham, West Midlands\n1975 births\nLiving people\nPeople educated at King Edward VI Handsworth", "machine_abstract": "Sarah Ann (Sally) Manners OBE, DBE, (born 8 May 1946 in London), is the author of more than thirty children's books and has been described as \"the most successful children’s writer since Enid Blyton\"[1][2][3][4][5]", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Sarah Manners\".

{"id": "SS Ste. Claire", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS%20Ste.%20Claire", "title": "SS Ste. Claire", "text": "SS Ste. Claire is a steamer located in Detroit, Michigan.  Built in 1910, she was one of the last propeller-driven excursion steamers to be operated on the Great Lakes.  She was declared a US National Historic Landmark in 1992. In 2018, a devastating fire destroyed the upper decks, leaving only the steel structure.\n\nHistory\nThe Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was incorporated in 1881 to provide ferry service between Detroit, Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit's Belle Isle Park. In 1898, the company began leasing Bois Blanc Island (later known as \"Bob-Lo\") and began offering ferry service to the island. Bois Blanc became a popular day trip destination, with picnic grounds, a small amusement area, dancing and other services. In 1901, the company purchased a large part of the island. Service to Bob-Lo became so popular that in 1902, the company hired Frank E. Kirby to design a passenger excursion steamer, . However, passenger volume continued to increase, and soon the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company commissioned another, slightly smaller steamer. This ship was again designed by Frank E. Kirby, and constructed at the Toledo Shipbuilding Company.\n\nThe Ste. Claire was launched at Toledo Shipbuilding Company in 1910, and entered service later that year between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island.  In 1911, the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was reorganized as the  Detroit and Windsor Ferry Company. However, the construction in the 1920s of the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor, and the MacArthur Bridge to Belle Isle drastically reduced the company's service, and by the late 1930s their only activity was the Detroit-Bob-Lo Island line. In the early 1940s, the company was renamed simply the \"Bob-Lo Excursion Company.\"\n\nThe excursion service and Boblo Island Amusement Park were sold in the 1940s, and again in 1979. However, the  Ste. Claire continued operating between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island until 1991, a run of 81 years.  After the island park closed, she was sold to a commercial firm and fell into disrepair.  In 2003 she was towed to Toledo, Ohio for restoration. In 2015, the vessel was towed to the former Detroit Lime Dock on the Rouge River, while her restoration remained in limbo.\n\nTemporary alterations to both Columbia and Ste. Claire were made for the 2014 feature film Transformers: Age of Extinction.\n\nThe Saint Claire was engulfed in an accidental fire while docked on the Detroit River on July 6, 2018. The fire could not be contained and destroyed the historic mahogany woodwork and upper decks. \"Yeah, she's 110 years old, but she's well-built and she survived,\" said boat co-owner, Ron Kattoo. \"We are at the point in restoration to where it was a steel skeleton structure ready to be rebuilt.\" As of 2019, the vessel is docked at Riverside Marina in Detroit.\n\nDescription\nThe Ste. Claire was a propeller-driven excursion steamer with a riveted steel hull and a wooden superstructure strengthened with steel members. The hull was 190 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 17.3 feet in molded depth. She was powered by a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine with Scotch boilers. The main deck overhung the hull, and the open decks above were rounded at the bow, a characteristic of the Bob-Lo fleet.\n\nThe main staircase was in the center of the main deck, leading upward to the upper decks. A second stair underneath lead down to the crew spaces in the hull. On either side of the main stair were gangplank openings for loading passengers. Forward of the stair was a large open deck space. Aft of the stair, a passageway ran across the vessel, aft of which is the stack casing and a well that opened down into the engine room, where the main engine could be seen by passengers on the main deck. Food service counters were placed at the aft end of the main deck, surrounded by open spaces, and a pair of stairs leading to decks above. Amidships, public rest rooms and crews quarters were placed on either side of the ship.\n\nThe main staircase lead upward to the main cabin on the second deck. The cabin was finished in mahogany with a cream-painted beamed ceiling. Aft of the cabin was a dance floor. The main cabin had doors out to open spaces forward and aft. The main stair leads upward to another, smaller cabin on the third deck. Doors here lead to the open deck and to a \"beer garden\" located above the dance floor. A final stair on the open deck lead to the top deck. Public access to the top deck was limited; the area also included the pilot house and lifeboat storage.\n\nSee also\n \n List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Southwestern Ontario Digital Archive: S.S.

It was also built on a small number of the higher-floor Leyland Swift chassis. It has a bolted aluminium structure with two windscreen styles.\n\nThe outward styling was quite plain, with a flat front. Some vehicles had a single-piece flat windscreen whilst others had two, separate, flat windscreens with the glass on the driver's side being raked back, reminiscent of some 1950s single-decker buses and the Leyland Lynx.\n\nLondon Regional Transport was the first and also the largest customer, buying nearly 200 Handybus bodied Dennis Darts. Go-Ahead Northern also bought over 80, and Ulsterbus and Citybus had 40 between them. The Handybus was succeeded in 1995 by the Crusader.\n\nPreservation\nA former London Regional Transport Handybus has been preserved by the London Transport Museum, Acton.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMidibuses\nStep-entrance buses\nVehicles introduced in 1990\nHandybus", "machine_abstract": "Wrightbus is the largest bus manufacturer in Australia, and one of the world's leading manufacturers of buses powered by diesel-electric hybrid technology.\nThe company was founded as Wright Brothers Coachbuilders (WB) on 1 May 1945 at Hume Street, Adelaide, South Australia, by brothers Frank and Ernest Wright who had previously been involved in building horse-drawn carriages.

{"id": "Austin Armoured Car", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin%20Armoured%20Car", "title": "Austin Armoured Car", "text": "The Austin Armoured Car was a British armoured car produced during the First World War. The vehicle is best known for its employment by the Imperial Russian Army in the First World War and by different forces in the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn addition to the British-built Austins, a few dozens of vehicles were manufactured in Russia in 1918–20. These are usually referred to as Austin-Putilov or – if fitted with a Kégresse halftrack chassis – Austin-Kégresse.\n\nProduction history\n\nBritish Austins\n\nIn August 1914, just after the beginning of the First World War, the army of the Russian Empire started to form armoured car units. Due to limited production capabilities of the country's automotive industry it was decided to order a number of vehicles abroad. A committee was sent to the United Kingdom, but failed to find an armoured car that met their requirements for overhead protection and two machine gun turrets.\n\nTo meet these requirements, the Austin Motor Company designed a new armoured car. The vehicle, known as Austin 1st series, was based on a passenger car chassis with rear-axle drive. Wheels were wooden, spoked, with pneumatic tyres and an additional set of wheels with full rubber tyres for use in combat was carried. Two Maxim machine guns were mounted in separate turrets placed on both sides of the hull behind the driver's cab. The vehicle was protected by armour plates 3.5–4 mm thick screwed to a body frame. The crew of four – commander, driver and two gunners – could enter or leave the vehicle via a door on the left side of the cab or via big two-leaf rear door. On 29 September 1914, 48 armoured cars were ordered. One car cost 1,150 pounds. After arrival in Russia the front and turret armour was replaced with 7 mm plates. First combat experience, however, revealed that the protection was still too weak and the vehicles were fully rearmoured at Izhorski Works, Izhorsk. The improved armour made the Austins much heavier, resulting in limited mobility and occasionally in chassis damage. However, the car was still considered more successful than alternative designs by, among others, Armstrong Whitworth, Renault and Sheffield-Simplex.\n\nOn 6 March 1915 the Russians ordered 60 vehicles of an improved design, known as Austin 2nd series. This time the chassis of a 1.5 ton truck with a more powerful engine was used. The hull was shorter, with thicker armour, the driver's cab roof was modified to improve machine guns' angle of fire. Less welcome was a removal of rear access door. The army also decided it wanted a rear driving post, so after arrival to Russia all vehicles were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section, which housed a second driving post and additional hatch. Another upgrade was the addition of side shields to the machine guns.\n\nSixty units of Austin 3rd series were ordered on 25 August 1916. The vehicles were similar in characteristics to the 2nd series, but had modified rear hull with driving post, MG shields, bulletproof glass in the front vision slots and lacked big side windows.\n\nYet another version, with strengthened chassis and double rear wheels, sometimes referred to as Austin model 1918, was ordered in 1917 but due to events in Russia none were delivered.\n\nRussian Austins\n\nIn 1916 a decision was made to produce a Russian armoured car on the well known Austin chassis. Sixty chassis units – identical to those used in 3rd series – were ordered from Austin. The mission of building armoured hulls was entrusted to Putilovski Works, Saint Petersburg. It was planned to build the cars by July 1917, but work was virtually brought to halt by the February Revolution and the subsequent chaos. Not until March 1918 were the first cars produced. Later the production was transferred to Izhorski Works. A total of 33 vehicles were produced in 1918–1920. In contemporary Russian documents the model was referred to as Russian Austin (Russian: Русский Остин – Russkij Ostin), but eventually became better known as Austin-Putilov (Russian: Остин-Путиловец – Ostin-Putilovets).\n\nTwelve hulls identical to those of Austin-Putilov were mounted on a Kégresse halftrack chassis, resulting in vehicles known as Austin-Kégresse. Production continued from July 1919 until March 1920 when it was stopped by shortage of materials and parts.\n\nRussian Austins' most obvious features were diagonally placed MG turrets (in order to reduce width) and additional right side door. They also had MG mounts with better elevation and other minor improvements.\n\nService history\n\nRussia\n\nArrival of the 1st series Austins allowed the formation of automobile machine gun platoons (Russian: пулемётный автомобильный взвод – pulemyotniy avtomobilniy vzvod or автопулемётный взвод – avtopulemyotniy vzvod). First platoons (5–12), formed according to the organization no. 19, each had three Austins, four staff cars, a truck, a workshop truck, a tanker truck and four motorcycles, with personnel of four officers and 45–46 soldiers. Further platoons (13–24, 26–28, 30–36), formed according to the organization no. 20, received only two Austins, but had a gun section consisting from a gun-armed Garford-Putilov Armoured Car, a staff car, a truck and a motorcycle. Platoons 5 to 12 received an additional Garford. Crews of those auto-MG platoons were entirely drawn from volunteers. Most of the platoons were used in the Western and South-Western Fronts, some platoons in the Northern Front and Caucasus. In combat they were attached to divisions or regiments.\n\nBy mid-1916 it was evident that larger units should be formed to make armoured cars more effective. In August, platoons were arranged into twelve \"armoured automobile battalions\" (Russian: броневой автомобильный дивизион – bronyevoy avtomobilniy divizion or автобронедивизион – avtobronedivizion), each attached to a specific army. Each battalion was formed from two to five former platoons, which were renamed to sections whilst retaining the old number. In some cases, for example in the Caucasus theatre, the platoon organization was retained.\n\nIn the Russian Civil War Austins were used by many participants, including both Red and White armies, Ukrainians etc. The Red Army had the largest number of vehicles, including all the Austin-Putilov and Austin-Kergesse vehicles and most of the 3rd series. In Soviet service the cars were organized into \"armoured automobile units\" (Russian: броневой автомоильный отряд – bronevoy avtomobilniy otryad or автоброневой отряд – avtobronevoy otryad), similar in strength to a World War I-era platoon: three machine gun-armed cars and one either gun-armed or machine gun-armed, four staff cars, five trucks, a tanker truck, a workshop truck and four motorcycles. The RKKA Austins also saw combat in the Polish-Soviet War. By 1921 the RKKA possessed about 16 Austins of the 1st series, 15 2nd series, 78 3rd series and Putilovs. British-built Austins were removed from service by 1931, and by 1933, the Russian-built ones were also retired.\n\nThe Austin-Putilov armoured car named Vrag Kapitala (Enemy of the Capital), on display at the Artillery Museum, Saint Petersburg, is often referred to as the vehicle which Lenin stood on to address the crowd in April 1917. However, it cannot be true as this armoured car was only manufactured in 1919.\n\nOther users\n\nBritish\nSixteen of the Austins built for Russian but not sent following the revolution were used to equip the 17th (Armoured Car) Battalion of the Tank Corps. The Vickers machine guns were exchanged for the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun, which was the standard machine gun of the British tank unit. The 17th Battalion arrived in France in April 1918. Its first operations were in support of the French Army in June. It returned to the British Army in August and was very successful at the Battle of Amiens. The Austins were towed in pairs by tanks across the mud of no-man's-land. Once they reached better ground on the other side of the lines, they ranged freely. A German Corps headquarters 10 miles back was captured and German reserves, artillery and supply lines were shot up. Having crossed the German frontier at Malmedy, Belgium, on 1 December 1918 after the Armistice, the 17th was the first British unit to enter Cologne on the Rhine on the 8th, escorting the Commanding Officer of 2nd Cavalry Brigade to negotiate Allied control of the city.\n\nAfter the war, the bodies were reused on Peerless lorry chassis. Some of these were still in service at the start of the Second World War.\n\nSome cars were sent to the Caspian Sea region. Austins were also used by the British in the Irish War of Independence.\n\nVariants\n Austin 1st series (or model 1914) – based on a passenger car chassis with 30 hp engine and rear axle drive. Wheels wooden, spoked. 3.5–4 mm armour, eventually replaced with 7 mm plates. Weight with original armour 2.66 ton. Road speed 50–60 km/h. Road range 250 km. Crew of 4 (commander, driver and two gunners). 48 units built.\n Austin 2nd series (or model 1915) – based on 1.5 ton truck chassis with 50 hp engine, shortened hull, thicker armour, redesigned driver's cab roof, no rear door. After arrival to Russia were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section (with second driving post and rear hatch) and MG side shields. Weight 5.3 ton. Road speed about 60 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 4–5. 60 units built.\n Austin 3rd series – Modified rear section and in the driver's cab, rear driver post, MG side shields, bulletproof glass in front vision slots, no big side windows, no rear hatch. Weight 5.3 ton. Road speed about 60 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 4–5. 60 units built.\n Austin model 1918 – Strengthened chassis, double rear wheels. 70 vehicles were ordered, but were not delivered due to events in Russia in 1917.\n Austin-Putilov – Had locally produced hull designed by the Putilovski Works, with diagonally placed MG turrets, right side door and thicker armour. Chassis, the same as in the 3rd series, were still ordered from Austin. Armour 4 to 7.5 mm thick. Weight 5.2 tons. Road speed about 55 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 5. 33 built.\n\n Austin-Kegresse (or Austin-Putilov-Kegresse) – Austin-Putilov hull mounted on a half-track chassis. Weight 5.8–5.9 tons. Road speed about 25 km/h. Road range 100 km. 12 built.\n Armoured hulls of damaged Austins were sometimes (mostly during the Russian Civil War) mounted on other chassis, usually White, Fiat or Packard. The combination of White chassis and Austin hull is sometimes referred to as White-Austin.\n\nOperators \n\n The last active Austin was probably the vehicle employed by the Austrian Army until 1935.\n\n At least one car was captured at the Dobruja Front at 17 November 1916 by the Bulgarian Armed Forces.\n\n Estonian Army used two captured Austin-Putilovs, named Tasuja and Suur Tõll.\n\n Two Austins 3rd series, initially sent by the Soviets in 1918 to help the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War, were taken over by the Finnish Army, which used them until the mid-1920s.\n\n Armed forces of Democratic Republic of Georgia operated several Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n Few captured vehicles were used during World War I on both fronts. Four vehicles, two 2nd Series and two 3rd Series, were used in 1918-1919 by the Freikorps armoured unit Kokampf (Kommando der Kampfwagenabteilungen) formed in Berlin as Kampfwagen Abteilung Körting to suppress the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in Berlin, Munich and Leipzig.\n\n A small number of Austin model 1918s were imported by the Japanese Army, where they remained in service until the early 1930s.\n\n Latvian Army used one Austin 2nd series, named Zemgaleetis (Zemgalietis in modern spelling), captured from the Soviets during the Latvian War of Independence.\n\n Two or three cars were given by the Soviets to the Mongolian People's Army in the early 1920s.\n\n Polish Armed Forces captured up to 20 Austins from the Soviets during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. Some were subsequently employed by the Polish. Five remained in service after the war, some until the 1930s.\n\n At least one Austin and four Austin-Putilovs were used by the Romanian Army.\n\n The Imperial Russian Army was the main user of Austin Armored Cars and after the end of the First World War the vehicles went to the Bolsheviks, White Russians, Georgia and Ukraine, among others.\n\n Vehicles taken over by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army initially went into action in the Russian Civil War, and were later used to suppress independent republics established in the former Russian Empire.\n\n Ukrainian People's Army operated unknown number of Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n British Army\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n M.

{"id": "New Jersey Route 183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Jersey%20Route%20183", "title": "New Jersey Route 183", "text": "Route 183 is a  long state highway in the northern regions of New Jersey. The southern end of the route is at an interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 206 (US 206) near Netcong, while the northern end is at an interchange with US 206 in Stanhope. The route heads northward through downtown Netcong and along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and enters Sussex County, New Jersey. The route is a former alignment of US 206 bypassed in 1973.\n\nThe highway dates back to the designations of State Highway Route 31, which was main north–south highway in New Jersey. The Netcong Circle, a traffic circle in Netcong between Route 183 and U.S. Route 46 was present for the entire lifetime of Route 183 until it was replaced by a signalized intersection in 2013. A nearby bridge over a New Jersey Transit line was also replaced.\n\nRoute description \n\nRoute 183 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 206 and Interstate 80 in the community of Roxbury, New Jersey. The route heads northward, intersecting with local dead-end streets deep in the forests of rural Morris County. Route 183 passes a nearby factory and intersects U.S. Route 46. The route continues northward, crossing over a creek and entering downtown Netcong. Downtown Netcong is highly developed, and Route 183 serves as the main street through the community. The highway intersects with Allen Street (Morris County Route 631) before running along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and into Sussex County.\n\nUpon entering Sussex County, Route 183 enters the community of Stanhope. At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue, the highway turns to the northwest, leaving the shores of the lake. Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope, working its way into the mountains above the lake. The roadway passes west of a park and ride lot located at an American Legion hall. At the intersection with Dell Road, Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound, and the highways merge a short distance later in Stanhope.\n\nHistory \nThe original designation in the area of Netcong along Route 183's alignment is State Highway Route 31, which consisted much of the alignment of current-day U.S. Route 206. The route was first assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering as a co-designation to US 206. This alignment remained in place for about two and half decades, when in the 1953 state highway renumbering, the State Highway Route 31 designation was dropped in favor of using U.S. Route 206. The route in Netcong stayed the same for several years after the decommissioning until the Regional Plan Association proposed a freeway realignment of US 206 in 1962.  The highway was to serve local recreation areas and relieve traffic on Interstate 287 to the east. The route was advocated through 1972, and after the fiscal year budgets went sour, the proposal was dropped.\n\nIn 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed the elimination of the Netcong Traffic Circle, located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80. The project was to produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and the elimination of the Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013.\n\nThe circle itself dated back to construction in 1938. The circle itself could not handle the 17,000 vehicles a year that use the large roadway daily, and was the site of several accidents, including 45 in 2007 alone.

{"id": "Vikram Dev", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram%20Dev", "title": "Vikram Dev", "text": "Maharajah Vikram Dev I or Vikram Dev was the king of Jeypore kingdom from 1758 to 1781. He was born in the Suryavansh Shankara Dynasty that ruled the region since 1443. He succeeded his brother Maharaja Lal Krishna Dev in a military coup in what is described as a critical period when the kingdom was under attack from all directions. The king battled and protected his kingdom from the French East India Company in Malkangiri, Marathas in Umerkote belt and the East India Company - Pusapati alliance in Jeypore and Rayagada. He retransferred the capital from Narayanapatna to Jeypore which had been deserted from the time of Balaram Dev in 1711. In the last years of his reign, the kingdom was demoted to a zamindari after they were defeated by the British. He was the 19th king of the Suryavansh dynasty of Kalinga that previously ruled the kingdom from Nandapur.\n\nEarly life \nVikram Dev was the son of Maharaja Raghunath Krishna Dev and the Sano Maharani (junior Eastern Chalukyan princess). Vikram was fifth in line of succession and was only crowned after his four elder brothers ruled and retired from kinship. He started a rebellion against his brother, King Lal Krishna Dev and succeeded him in 1757 as a result of a successful military coup.\n\nVikram witnessed the expansion of the kingdom under his father Maharajah Raghunath Krishna and saw its downfall in the reign of his elder brothers - Ram Chandra Dev, Balaram Dev III, Vishwambhar Dev II and Lala Krishna Dev. Till the reign of his father, the kings of Jeypore ruled over the largest kingdom of Kalinga and claimed to be the Maharajas of Kalinga. However, a feud between young princes - Ram Chandra Dev and Balaram Dev III gave opportunity to their minister Viziaram Raz to hatch a conspiracy against the kingdom. This conspiracy later helped the Pusapatis gain independence from Jeypore and establish their capital, Vizianagaram. The later kings, Vishwambhar Dev II and Lal Krishna Dev ruled the kingdom from their new capital in Narayanapatna. The kingdom was suffering from the politics and skirmishes of the Vizianagaram king and his French allies. This need of the hour compelled Vikram Dev to take a stringent step and succeed his brother.\n\nSome accounts also suggest that Viziaram Raz intended to instigate an internal revolt by instigating Vikram Dev against the activities and decisions of his brother and the king which could have been a possible reason behind the fallout.\n\nReign \nVikram Dev was crowned in 1758 which was a period of urgency for the kingdom that was facing enemies from all directions. On the eastern realm, the rival chief of Vizianagaram formed an alliance with the British along with the Nizam of Hyderabad, claiming ownership over the whole kingdom of Jeypore. The Southern territory of Malkangiri was being infiltrated by the French and the Northern and Western were under a threat by the Maratha Empire which had conquered almost all of the neighbouring kingdoms. Henceforth, the reign of Vikram Dev was wholly renounced to various battles which debilitated the kingdom from later putting on a challenge against the British.\n\nHe married Rajkumari Lalitamani Patta Devi, the princess of Kalahandi which served as a former feudatory but claimed independence with the help of the Marathas during the critical period under Ram Chandra Dev. This marriage alliance proved helpful to Vikram Dev in near future as he evaded to Kalahandi after losing the crucial battle of Jeypore to the British. He later raised an army against the British in Rayagada valley but was defeated yet again.\n\nBattle of Malkangiri \nMalkangiri was in the southern region of Jeypore kingdom. In 1760, the troops of the French East India Company infiltrated this region with an intention of attacking the Marathas. They came as far as the town and were halted by the zamindar of Malkangiri who further informed the king about the confrontation. Evidently, Vikram Dev arrived with his army and drove out the French troops who retreated beyond the river, Godavari.\n\nBattle of Umerkote \n\nThe rising prowess of the Marathas led them to conquer much of India and establish an empire. The eastern kingdoms lying in the region of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bengal were all conquered by the forces of the Maratha Empire. The neighbouring kingdoms of Bastar and Kalahandi State were taken over by the Maratha Generals who wanted control over Jeypore to consolidate their position and battle the British.\n\nThe Maratha army began invasion from the Umerkote belt and soon faced the army of Jeypore led by Vikram Dev. Evidently, the Marathas were defeated and driven out of the region and Jeypore remained independent from the Maratha Empire.\n\nBattle of Jeypore \nThe ruler of Vizianagaram failed to maintain good relations with the French and joined the British camp in order to usurp the neighbouring kingdoms of Jeypore and Paralakhemundi. In 1765, the British acquired the Northern Circars and three years later Viziaram Raz II wrote to the Madras Presidency stating that the whole kingdom of Jeypore was granted to him by Salabat Jung, Mughal Governor of Deccan on an annual payment of 24,000 rupees. The Madras Government considering the past services of Viziaram Raz, in 1769, granted three important territories of the Jeypore Rajya called Kasipatnam, Nandapur and Madugula to the Raja of Vizianagaram.\n\nIn 1775, the kingdom of Paralakhemundi was under an attack by the British which propelled Vikram Dev to assemble a large force in the fort of Rayagada valley. Meanwhile, the Briitish troops along with the army of Vizianagaram attacked Jeypore in the absence of the king. The guarding troops of the fort and the people of Jeypore fought valiantly against much formidable opponents. The description of their brave defense was written by Captain Richard Matthews on 14th February, 1775 where he mentioned that his troops came through the pass with great difficulty as the enemies continuously fought with his army when they were only a few miles away from Jeypore. \n\nHowever, the British took over the capital of Jeypore and the fort was demolished under the instructions of Captain Richard Matthewse. He writes in his memoir:\n\nVikram Dev prepared for the battle in Rayagada against the British and Vizianagaram but failed against a superior army. Seeing that the defeat was inevitable, he eloped to the neighboring kingdom of Kalahandi. Meanwhile, Viziaram Raz did acquire Jeypore but faced a serious revolt and protests from the denizens who pledged their loyalty to the former dynasty. The protests got violent when the Vizianagaram troops began using force to control the civilians. Therefore, the British government of Madras agreed to return the territories to Vikram Dev under an annual settlement of 40,000 rupees. The kingdom was annexed to the British territories as a Zamindari or tributary baronial estate and Vikram Dev was granted the title of 'Raja' like other zamindars.\n\nConquest of Bastar \nIn 1777, Raja Daryao Deo of Bastar was ousted by his brother Raja Ajmer Singh and the former absconded to Jeypore seeking shelter in the fort of Vikram Dev. Essentially, Raja Daryao was accompanied by Vikram Dev to the capital of Bastar with one hundred cavalry, one hundred swordsmen, twelve thousand infantry, twenty canons and fifteen war elephants and was further joined by thousands of rebel soldiers. The defense of Ajgar Singh collapsed in a day and Daryao Deo was reinstalled on the throne of Bastar. The pargana of Kotpad was presented to Vikram Dev for his services, this pargana had five forts - Umerkote, Churchunda, Raigarh, Kotpad and Podagada.\n\nDeath \nVikram Dev died in 1781 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ram Chandra Dev II. Meanwhile, his other two sons - Jagganath Dev was made the Raja of Nabarangpur and Narsingh Dev was crowned as the Raja of Gudari, Rayagada.\n\nReferences \n\n1701 births\n1781 deaths", "machine_abstract": "Vikram Dev (born 6 May 1974) is the current Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, India and leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in that state since November 2013 after defeating incumbent Badrendra Singh Bisht from the Indian National Congress party by over 1 million votes[1][2][3][4]", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Vikram Dev\".

Rovner was the first woman appointed to the Seventh Circuit. She was previously a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nEarly life, education and career\n\nRovner was born in Riga, Latvia. While an infant, she and her mother immigrated to the United States during World War II from Latvia to escape its occupation by Nazi Germany. She earned her Artium Baccalaureus degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1960. She studied at King's College London for one year and attended Georgetown University Law Center for two years before moving to Chicago. She received a Juris Doctor from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 1966. She was a legal researcher for Richard J. Phelan of Chicago, Illinois in 1971.\n\nShe was a law clerk for Judge James Benton Parsons of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois from 1972 to 1973. She was an Assistant United States Attorney of the Northern District of Illinois from 1973 to 1977, serving as Deputy Chief of the Public Protection Unit from 1975 to 1976 and Chief of the Public Protection Unit from 1976 to 1977. She was a deputy governor and legal counsel for Governor James R. Thompson of Illinois from 1977 to 1984.\n\nFederal judicial service\nOn June 19, 1984, President Ronald Reagan nominated Rovner to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated by Judge Joel Flaum. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 12, 1984, and received commission the same day. Her service was terminated on August 17, 1992, due to elevation to the Seventh Circuit.\n\nOn July 2, 1992, President George H. W. Bush nominated Rovner to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated by Judge Harlington Wood Jr. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 12, 1992, and received commission on August 17, 1992.\n\nNotable cases\nOn April 20, 2018, Rovner ruled against Trump's policy punishing sanctuary cities. She said allowing federal agencies to add conditions to grant funds without explicit congressional authority could lead to \"tyranny.\" Rovner wrote, \"The Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds. It falls to us, the judiciary, as the remaining branch of the government, to act as a check on such usurpation of power.\"\n\nRovner was joined by William J. Bauer upholding the nationwide injunction against the policy. Daniel Anthony Manion partially dissented, saying he would narrow the injunction to protect only Chicago.\n\nOn August 27, 2019, Rovner joined David Hamilton in blocking Indiana's parental notification requirement for abortions. Michael Kanne dissented. On November 1, 2019, the 7th circuit denied en banc by a vote of 6–5, with Rovner in the majority. Frank Easterbrook, who provided a decisive vote, called on the Supreme Court to hear the case. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ordered a re-hearing in the case.\n\nReferences\n\n1938 births\n20th-century American judges\nAlumni of King's College London\nAmerican women judges\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nBryn Mawr College alumni\nIllinois Institute of Technology alumni\nIllinois lawyers\nIllinois Republicans\nJudges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\nJudges of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois\nLatvian emigrants to the United States\nLatvian World War II refugees\nLatvian Jews\nLiving people\nPoliticians from Chicago\nUnited States court of appeals judges appointed by George H.

{"id": "Mr Brownlow", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr%20Brownlow", "title": "Mr Brownlow", "text": "Mr Brownlow is a character from the 1838 novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. A bookish and kindly middle-aged bachelor, he helps Oliver to escape the clutches of Fagin. He later adopts Oliver Twist by the end of the novel.\n\nThe novel\nMr Brownlow is introduced when the Artful Dodger and his companion Charley Bates pick his pocket and Oliver Twist is arrested simply for \"looking guilty\". Later, in court, Brownlow discovers Oliver is completely innocent and, after dealing with the extremely agitated magistrate, Mr Fang, he takes him home fearing the boy to be very ill, which he is. He calls on a doctor, who after making frequent incorrect guesses to Oliver's condition, simply concludes the boy is recovering from a fever.\n\nBrownlow's maid, Mrs Bedwin, is a kind old lady who immediately takes to Oliver upon his arrival. Later, when Grimwig, an old friend of Brownlow's, evaluates the boy and his condition, a boy arrives from the book shop but fails to take some other books that needed to be returned. Oliver volunteers to return them and takes off, much to the chagrin and doubt of Mr Grimwig, who is revealed to be cynical in nature, expecting the boy to return to his old life among the lower class and promises to \"eat his head\" should the boy return in 10 minutes. A watch is set down and the waiting begins. Later, after Oliver is captured by Nancy and Bill Sikes, it is revealed that much later, close to midnight, the two men are still waiting in the dark. (In the 1997 film version of the novel, Mr Brownlow asks Oliver to take a couple of books and some money and asks him to be back in half an hour, although Oliver says he will be back in 20 minutes.)\n\nThe next mention of Brownlow occurs when Mr Bumble rears him after he sees a notice in a newspaper that offers five guineas for any knowledge about Oliver's past or whereabouts; it was a sticky encounter. Mr Bumble at once tells Brownlow that Oliver was born from deplorable lineage and, ever since birth, Oliver has done nothing but display ingratitude and malice. He also mentions Oliver had attacked another boy without provocation and shows Brownlow reports to prove it. Brownlow doesn't want to believe it at first, but gradually comes to conclusion that Oliver had been playing him for a fool and requests Oliver's name should not be invoked in his household ever again. His housekeeper Mrs Bedwin, however, feels that Oliver was truly a good child and not a criminal.\n\nWhen Oliver is taken in by the Maylies and asks the kind Dr. Losberne to take him to Brownlow's home in London only to find the house is \"FOR LEASE\". The only clue to his whereabouts are from his neighbours mentioning the West Indies, saying he was looking for someone.\n\nWhen Mr Brownlow returns to London, Oliver by chance spots him and can clear his name. Mr Brownlow is very happy about that and takes Oliver in once again, taking part in Nancy's plot to save Oliver from Fagin.  At the end of the book, Brownlow officially adopts Oliver as his son.\n\nSources\n\nMr Brownlow's name and character generally believed to be derived from John Brownlow, the director of the Foundling Hospital, which was dedicated to looking after abandoned and unwanted children.  Dickens, a regular visitor to the hospital, knew Brownlow well. Dickens scholar Robert Alan Colby argues that \"in naming Oliver's benefactor Mr Brownlow, Dickens seems to have been paying a tribute to one of the most dedicated social servants of his age\". In 1831, seven years before Dickens wrote Oliver Twist, John Brownlow had written a novel about an orphan called Hans Sloane - a Tale, which has a plot broadly similar to Dickens' later work. Several critics have suggested that Dickens took aspects of the basic plot of his novel from Brownlow's earlier work, so the name may have been a tribute for two reasons.\n\nVariations\nBrownlow is presented as Oliver's grandfather in David Lean's 1948 film version of the novel (actor: Henry Stephenson). This is also the case in the stage musical version. In the musical, after retrieving him from London Bridge, where Nancy is murdered while trying to return the boy to Brownlow, it is assumed that Oliver goes to live with him. However, this may vary between productions as in the latest revival, as in the 1968 film Oliver is taken hostage and subsequently saved when Bill is shot during his escape attempt (actor: Joseph O'Conor).\n\nIn the film version of Oliver!, Brownlow is made into Oliver's great-uncle, and the boy is saved, not at London Bridge, but from the rooftops of London, where Bill Sikes, who has murdered Nancy and taken Oliver as a hostage, has forced him to crawl out on a wooden hoist in order to loop a rope that Sikes intends to use in his escape. However, Sikes is shot by a member of the crowd below, and Oliver is saved.\n\nIn Disney's Oliver & Company, Brownlow's variant is represented as a little girl named Jenny Foxworth (actress: Natalie Gregory), who is cared for by her butler Winston while her parents are on a business trip to Europe. She adopts the kitten Oliver after a failed heist and is the one who names him. Unlike the novel, after Oliver disappears, Jenny begins searching for him with the help of her dog Georgette (the film's version of Charlotte) and runs into Fagin who is moved by her plight and gives Oliver back. She is soon after kidnapped by Sikes and a chase ensues with Fagin, the dogs and Oliver rescuing her.\n\nPortrayals\nActors who have portrayed Mr Brownlow in films and TV:\nLionel Belmore (1922 film)\nAlec B.

Aquino said that while he is open to adopt nuclear energy he is more inclined to tap \"other sources of energy that have less impact – or potential negative impact – that are available to us. While Aquino remained open to nuclear energy he has publicly expressed his opposition to plans to revive the moth-balled Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nEnvironmental policy\nDuring an interview in CNN in November 2013, Aquino said that countries \"contributing immensely to the global warning\" have a moral responsibility to contribute to end climate change.\n\nFinancial policy\n\nPriority Development Assistance Fund\nFollowing the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, Aquino initially insisted that the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF is unnecessary. Aquino later detracted from his earlier statement and vowed to abolish the fund and replace it with a new system.\n\nSocial policy\n\nAbortion and reproductive health\nDespite his support for the Reproductive Health Bill, which was perceived by critics as a precedent to a law on legalizing abortion, Aquino insists that he is against the legalization of abortion.\n\nAquino supported the passing of the Reproductive Health Bill. He believes on the responsibility of the state to inform couples on their right to plan their family.\n\nForeign land ownership\nAquino is against revising the constitution to allow full land ownership by foreigners. Aquino remains firm in keeping the 60/40 foreign ownership law which guarantees Filipinos majority share on land ownership.\n\nGay marriage\nAquino has yet to make a firm stance on gay marriage. During a forum at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza in December 2013, Aquino was inquired on his view on gay marriage and if he was in favor of its legalization. Aquino initially refused to answer the question but later clarified his views on the issue. He said that while he believes on universal human rights he is undecided on the legalization of gay marriage. Aquino expressed some concerns that legalization of gay marriage may follow legalization of abortion. He said that the issue must first be viewed on a \"child's perspective\".He expressed concerns that children adopted by gay marriage couples may experience gender confusion.\n\nSecurity policy\n\nGun ownership\nAquino, a gun enthusiast himself, is against the imposition of a total gun ban in the country. He believes in the right to bear arms. On May 29, 2013, Aquino signed the Republic Act No. 10591, an \"Act Providing for a Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition and Providing Penalties for Violations thereof\", providing a new set of standards on obtaining a license to bear firearms.\n\nHeight restriction on security personnel\nAquino vetoed a bill that would have remove height restrictions on police, fire and jail personnel. Aquino found the bill unnecessary as a waiver can be given to applicants under certain conditions. Aquino insists that jail personnel in particular \"must possess the necessary physical attributes to perform their functions effectively\".\n\nForeign policy\n\nChina\nAquino has made statements critical to China indirectly and directly. At the 2013 ASEAN summit in Brunei, He accused China of being uncooperative after it rejected to participate in a case filed by the Philippines to the United Nations tribunal.

{"id": "Leighton Bromswold", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leighton%20Bromswold", "title": "Leighton Bromswold", "text": "Leighton Bromswold  (also known as Leighton) is a small village and civil parish in Cambridgeshire, England. Leighton lies approximately  west of Huntingdon. Leighton is situated within Huntingdonshire which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire as well as being a historic county of England. The civil parish of which it is part is called Leighton and in 2001 had a population of 224, falling to 210 at the 2011 Census. The parish covers an area of .\n\nHistory\nLeighton Bromswold was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Leightonstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Lectone. In 1086 there was just one manor at Leighton Bromswold; the annual rent paid to the lord of the manor in 1066 had been £23 and the rent was the same in 1086.\n\nThe Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there were 39 households at Leighton Bromswold. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5.0 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Leighton Bromswold in 1086 is that it was within the range of 136 and 195 people.\n\nThe survey records that there were 19.5 ploughlands at Leighton Bromswold in 1086. In addition to the arable land, there was  of meadows,  of woodland and a water mill at Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Leighton Bromswold the total tax assessed was 15 geld.\n\nNo church is recorded in the Domesday Book at Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe village has at various times been known as \"Lecton\" (11th century), \"Leghton\" and \"Leghton upon Brouneswold\" (14th century).\n\nGovernance\nAs a civil parish, Leighton has a parish council. The parish council is the lowest tier of government in England and is elected by the residents on the electoral roll. A parish council is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including allotments and a cemetery; grass cutting and tree planting within public open spaces such as a village green or playing fields. The parish council reviews all planning applications that might affect the parish and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the local planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises a parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. The parish council consists of five councillors.\n\nLeighton was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Leighton became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Leighton is a part of the district ward of Ellington and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council.\n\nFor Leighton the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Cambridgeshire County Council consists of 69 councillors representing 60 electoral divisions. Leighton is part of the electoral division of Sawtry and Ellington, represented by one councillor.\n\nLeighton is in the parliamentary constituency of North West Cambridgeshire, and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Leighton is represented in the House of Commons by Shailesh Vara (Conservative). Shailesh Vara has represented the constituency since 2005. The previous member of parliament was Brian Mawhinney (Conservative) who represented the constituency between 1997 and 2005.\n\nGeography\nThe parish of Leighton Bromswold contains , about half of which is arable and half grass land. Salome Wood is a plantation in the north of the parish, and there are one or two coppices. The soil is heavy and the subsoil is Oxford Clay. The land is undulating and is watered by two brooks, the one flowing from the west through the north and middle part of the parish; and the other, the Ellington Brook, flowing eastward through the southern part of the parish, forms the boundary for short distances. Between these brooks is a high ridge of land known as the Bromswold. On this ridge and also north of the northern brook the land rises to over  above Ordnance datum. From the ridge the land falls to about  to the southern brook and about  to the northern. The population was chiefly engaged in agriculture until the late 20th century.\n\nThe village is on the ridge between the two brooks and contains some 17th-century timber framed and plastered houses. The village street lies along the road to Old Weston, with Sheep Street branching off to the north east to Duck End, and Leighton Hill to the south. The church stands at the south-east end of the village, with the Manor Farm, formerly called Church Farm, to the west. South east of the church is the site of the Prebendal Manor House where in the Middle Ages the original village was located. The church is Grade I listed whilst there are seven Grade II listed buildings within the village.\n\nDemography\n\nPopulation\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of Leighton was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 246 (the lowest was in 1811) and 455 (the highest was in 1851).\n\nFrom 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).\n\nAll population census figures from report Historic Census figures Cambridgeshire to 2011 by Cambridgeshire Insight.\n\nIn 2011, the parish covered an area of  and the population density of Leighton in 2011 was 43 persons per square mile (16.6 per square kilometre).\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe Leightonstone\n\nAlongside the Lych Gate of St Mary's Church stands the Leightonstone. It was originally situated to the south east of the Church, where the village originally stood. The Leightonstone is the ancient marker where the Moot Court of the Hundred of Leightonstone gathered to collect taxes and cast judgement of many local issues that were within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\nThe Leightonstone was actually sited on the other side of the church but to prevent it becoming lost or damaged it has been moved a few hundred metres to its present location by the church gate together with a commemorative plaque and seating.\n\nWar memorial\n\nThe limestone memorial takes the form of a small medieval-style Latin cross and plinth. The plinth has tracery decorative detail on each corner and flower motif in a band around the top. The names of the nine men from the parish who lost their lives fighting in the First World War are inscribed on the plinth and painted\nblack. The memorial is surrounded by concrete paving and wooden posts with chain link. The memorial was unveiled in 1920 and was the work of Mr Pettit of Godmanchester.\n\nThis memorial was a recipient of a grant from the Grants for War Memorials scheme in 2007. In 2009, War Memorials Trust applied for the listing of the war memorial cross. In March, the Trust was advised that the memorial has been listed at Grade II.\n\nThe castle gatehouse\n\nThis interesting earthwork, the site where Sir Gervase Clifton (died 1618) 'began to build a goodly house', is a grass field 600 ft. by 300 ft.enclosed on three sides by large banks averaging 35 ft. across the base, and being 4 ft. 6in. high within the enclosure but 10 ft. outside. On the west side, there is a slightly raised ridge which seems to indicate the line where a bank ran.\n\nAt the four corners and almost entirely outside the lines of the banks are curious circular bastions; that at the south-east corner is the best preserved, and is 80 ft. in diameter and its top rises 5 ft. above the bank; those at the other corners appear to have been the same but are not so well preserved. Wherever the edge of the banks and bastions has been cut into a line of broken red bricks, apparently of early date, is exposed, and it would therefore appear that these banks were made by Sir Gervase Clifton, who used the materials of an older house for the purpose.\n\nThe bastions were probably merely ornamental features and never intended for purposes of defence. The gatehouse of Sir Gervase Clifton's house, now a private residence, has a moat.\n\nSalome\n\nJust outside the village are some signs of a hamlet that has almost disappeared. The chapel of Salen is mentioned in 1248 (fn. 72) and in 1299 the question arose as to its being a sanctuary. In 1444 the sum of 16s. 8d. was paid 'pro le riggyng and redyng de la chapell, hall and le chaumbre' at Leighton Bromswold. The site is marked on a map by Thomas Norton (c. 1660) as a square inclosure at the north-west corner of Elecampane Close near the south-west angle of Salome Wood. Near it is a spot marked St Tellin (St Helen) Well. The inclosure is still represented by a slight mound and ditch, and excavations by Dr Garrood disclosed the foundations of the chapel, tiles, glazed pottery, fragments of medieval painted glass, and a coin of Gaucher de Porcein (1314–1329); while a damp depression in the ground nearby may represent the well.\n\nCulture and community\nThe village is home to the Green Man public house which was first licensed in 1650.\n\nThe village has a social programme. In July 2011 the village celebrated its charter to run a fair by holding a street party. The charter was given by William, treasurer of King John, who in 1211 obtained a charter for a fair to be held on the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross (3 May). There were later two fairs, one on May Day and the other on 24 September. Through the Leighton Bromswold Social Committee a number of other events were held in 2011 including a Safari Supper, Cheese & Wine Evening, trip to the seaside, music festival, Halloween and Bonfire, Senior Citizens' Lunch and Children's Party.\n\nSt Mary the Virgin's Church\n\nThe Grade I listed church of St Mary, Leighton Bromswold, consists of a chancel ( by  feet), nave ( by 24 feet), north transept ( by  feet), south transept ( by  feet), west tower (15 by 14 feet) and north and south porches. The walls are of coursed rubble with stone dressings, except the tower, which is faced with ashlar, and the roofs are covered with tiles and lead.\n\nThe church is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey (1086). A chancel and an aisled nave were built about 1250, but this chancel was apparently rebuilt about 1310, and large transepts were added to the nave some forty years later. Probably the aisles were partly rebuilt and new windows inserted in them, and perhaps a clerestory added to the nave towards the end of the 15th century. At the beginning of the 17th century the church was in a ruinous condition, and apparently about 1606 a rebuilding was commenced; the south arcade and aisle were pulled down and the south wall of an aisleless nave and south porch built. The work, however, was stopped for lack of funds, and for twenty years the church was 'so decayed, so little, and so useless, that the parishioners could not meet to perform their duty to God in public prayer and praises.' The roofs had fallen in, and the tower was in ruins as were the upper courses of the walls and the nave was roofless.\n\nChancel\nThe 14th-century chancel has a four-light east window with original jambs, but a late-15th-century depressed four-centred head; on the north side of it a 13th-century capital (now mutilated) has been built in as a bracket. The north wall has two original three-light windows with intersecting tracery in a two-centred head; a late-15th-century three-light window with a depressed four-centred head; and a 13th-century locker with trefoiled head and stone shelf. The south wall has three windows similar to those on the north; a small late-15th-century doorway; a blocked original doorway, only visible inside; a blocked low-side window; a reset 13th-century double piscina having one whole and two half semicircular intersecting arches with interpenetrating mouldings, carried on a central shaft and two detached jamb-shafts with moulded capitals and bases. The 13th-century chancel arch is two-centred, of two chamfered orders, the lower order resting on triple attached corbel-shafts with moulded capitals and modern corbels. The roof is modern, but the moulded principals of 1626 remain. The weathering of the earlier roof remains above the chancel arch.\n\nNave\nThe nave has, on each side of the chancel arch, the 13th-century respond column of the former arcades; they are semicircular with moulded capitals and bases. The 17th-century north wall has a reset late-15th-century three-light window; a reset 14th-century archway to the porch, of two chamfered orders (probably the old arch between the aisle and transept re-used), the lower order resting on mutilated corbels, reset and altered in the 17th century; and a slight recess close to the west end, as for the inner splay of a window. The 17th-century south wall has features similar to those of the north wall. Both walls have splayed plinths, but those on the south appear to be of rather coarse workmanship and do not extend round the porch, while those on the north are finely wrought and are carried along the east and west walls of the porch.\n\nNorth transept\n\nThe 14th-century north transept has a four-light east window with reticulated tracery in a two-centred head. The north wall has a late-15th-century three-light window with a depressed four-centred head. The west wall has, near its northern end, a blocked late-14th-century doorway; and at the southern end the weather stones of the early aisle roof remain. In the north transept are some 17th-century red and yellow glazed flooring tiles.\n\nSouth transept\n\nThe 14th-century south transept is similar to the north except that it has no doorway in the west wall. In the east wall is a rectangular shelf-bracket ornamented with ball-flowers and supported on a carved head. The south wall has a trefoiled-headed piscina and a rectangular locker.\n\nRoof\n\nThe roofs of the chancel, nave and transepts are all of 1626. In the chancel are five trusses with moulded tie beams, moulded and panelled braces and moulded wall-posts with shaped and moulded pendants. On the nave, six bays similar to the chancel with some repairs; transept roofs are similar each of three bays.\n\nThe 17th-century north porch has a mid-13th-century north doorway, perhaps the old door of the former aisle in situ; it has a two-centred head of three orders, the two outer orders springing from detached jamb-shafts with moulded capitals and bases and the inner order continuous. The porch has no buttresses, but the plinth of the nave is continued along its east and west walls.\n\nThe 17th-century south porch has a mid-13th-century south doorway, almost certainly rebuilt, as it does not seem to be quite on the line of the former aisle wall; it has a two-centred arch of three moulded orders enriched with dog-tooth ornament, and resting on four detached jamb-shafts on each side, having moulded capitals and bases. The east wall has a plain square-headed 17th-century window. The porch has buttresses square at the angles, probably largely of 13th-century material re-used.\n\nScreens\n\nUnder chancel-arch there is a low screen in two parts with opening in middle, plain lower panels and open upper panels, six on each side, with round arches springing from short turned balusters, moulded top rail and turned knobs over alternate balusters and flanking central opening; c. 1630–40. In south transept modern screen to vestry incorporating eleven bays of arcading probably from one of the stalls or seats, c. 1630–40. In the west tower across north west angle, curved screen or partition of moulded panelling, 16th-century, cornice and door modern now used as a store room.\n\nTwin pulpits\n\nThe two Pulpits date from 1626, are of oak and of the same general design, set against the two responds of the chancel-arch, each of pentagonal form with a short flight of steps, base having a series of short turned balusters connected by segmental arches and capped by a cornice, the whole continued outwards as a rail to the stairs; upper part of pulpit, each face divided into two bays by turned columns with moulded bases and capitals from which spring segmental arches and the whole finished with an entablature; door similar but with one half-column only, between the bays and with strap-hinges; sounding-board resting on panelled standard at back with two attached pilasters; board finished with an entablature with segmental arches below and turned pendants, boarded soffit with turned pendant in middle.\n\nBenches\n\nIn the nave there are fourteen benches, upper parts of backs with a series of panels formed by attached half-balusters, with moulded top rail, open ends with turned terminals and curved armrests, supported by turned balusters, c. 1630–40, made up with some modern work. In north transept-six benches generally similar to those in nave but with open arcaded backs formed by segmental arches resting on turned balusters, also one front enclosure of similar design and two benches at east end of nave, c. 1630–40. In chancel-four stalls similar to the benches in the north transept, but with half-balusters attached to the lower panelling, made up with modern work.\n\nLectern\n\nThe modern lectern (1903) incorporates some oak balusters and knobs from the staircase of Stow Longa Manor House and was given in memory of Rev. Thomas Ladd who was buried in the churchyard in 1899.\n\nWest tower\n\nIt is generally believed that the west tower was built by James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond in 1634, however there is no authority for this. In the July of that year he was just 12 when he succeeded the Dukedom on the death of his father Esmé Stewart. His mother, Katherine Clifton of Leighton Bromswold continued to hold the titles and the lordship until her own death in September 1637. There is also the suggestion that John Ferrar produced a 'ruff draught' for a tower after 1634 with the note \"for the finishing of Layton church that he might the better in time provide\".\n\nJames, Duke of Lennox, Earl of March, Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold was at the height of his powers in 1641 and it was probable that the tower was completed before or in that year. On the parapet are the initials 'R.D. 1641', probably made by Richard Drake, a long-standing friend of Nicholas Ferrar. In 1655 it was recorded that \"Only the steeple could not be compassed wch afterwards the most Noble, Religious, worthy good Duke of Lenox did perform at his own proper cost & charges, to the Memorial of his Honor.\"\n\nThe tower is of three stages finished with a modillioned cornice between the buttresses, an embattled parapet and angle pedestals, supporting obelisks with ball-terminals. The two-centred tower-arch is of two classically moulded orders springing from square responds with moulded imposts. The west window is of two coupled lights divided and flanked by plain pilasters and with round heads, moulded archivolts and imposts; the west doorway is flanked by plain pilasters with moulded capitals, and has a half-round moulded arch with a plain keystone; above the doorway is a plain tablet.\n\nThe second stage has in the west wall a square-headed window with a moulded stone architrave. The bell-chamber has in each wall a double window similar to, but larger than, the west window of the ground-stage; above each pair of windows is a lozenge-shaped panel.\n\nThe stairs to the belfry are at the south-west corner. In the north-eastern corner of the tower is a modern disused brick chimney. On the tower floor is the matrix of a 15th-century monumental brass with the figure of a man and an inscription plate. In 1552 there were four bells and a sanctus bell.\n\nBells\n\nWithin the west tower are five bells dating 1641 and 1720. The bells were rehung, in a new frame, in 1902 by Barwell of Birmingham and a brass plaque commemorating the event is on the north wall of the nave. \nThe biggest bell weighs 21hundredweight 1 quarter and 4 pounds making it the 3rd heaviest ring of 5 bells in the country. They hang in a 6 bell frame (6.1) with space for a new treble.\nMore info: http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Leighton+Bromswold&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=LEIGHTONBR\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nBrackets in chancel east wall, in form of moulded capital, late-13th-century, now cut back to wall-face. In south transept east wall, rectangular shelf with 'ball-flower' ornament and a carved head below, early-14th-century\n\nCommunion Table: with turned legs, moulded top rails with shaped brackets, plain lower rails, c. 1630–40, top modern.\n\nThere are two chairs in the chancel with moulded and twisted legs, front rail, and back-uprights, of c. 1700. A 16th-century chest is in the north transept and is plain with coped lid, two locks, iron straps and three strap¬hinges, all terminating in fleurs-de-lis.\n\nThe font is made up of two 13th-century circular moulded capitals and a piece of circular shaft. The cover is largely modern, but has a 17th-century ball on the top and a Victorian mounting.\n\nIn the nave the north and south doorways, the doors are twinned, each of two leaves with moulded panels and nail-studded framing; both doors set in moulded framing, with panelling above, mid-17th-century, partly repaired.\n\nThe Lockers in chancel north wall, with rebated jambs and trefoiled head, stone division or shelf, late 13th¬century. In south transept south wall, rectangular, with chamfered and rebated reveals, 14th-century.\n\nIn chancel, on the south wall, there is a double piscinae. with two-centred arches the moulding continued to form an intersecting arcade, free shaft to each jamb and in middle, with moulded capitals and bases, shelves within the recess, at level of abaci of side-shafts, two multifoiled drains, mid-13th-century, reset. In south transept in the south wall, there is a recess with trefoiled head and round drain, 14th-century.\n\nRainwater heads\n\nRainwater-heads are in lead. On north and south walls of chancel there are four, three with embattled tops and painted decoration, curved junction with down-pipes, on one of which is a fleur-de-lis; one head on south side elaborately shaped, with enriched cornice and cresting, the date 1632, and strap-work ornament on the flanges, junction with down-pipe enriched with acanthus ornament, down-pipe with strap-work ornament and enriched straps with three crests. On the north wall of north transept two shaped heads with embattled tops, the two heads bearing together the date 1634. On north wall of nave, head with arabesque ornament and painted decoration; on south wall, with rounded and moulded head. On south wall of south transept, two similar to those on north transept, but with painted decoration and no date, all 17th-century.\n\nAltar-tombs\n\nIn the north transept is an alabaster altar-tomb with mutilated effigies of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who died on 10 May 1572 in Leighton Bromswold, and Elizabeth, his last wife who died in 1578. Altar-tomb of alabaster, south side divided into three bays by ornamental pilasters, shield in middle bay with arms three tirwhitts for Tyrwhitt quartering a chief indented, the whole impaling a lion rampant with a forked tail and a border, figures of daughter and two swaddled infants in side bays; similar pilasters west end of tomb, forming two bays each with a shield bearing the quarterly coat above and the impaled coat; on tomb, recumbent effigies of man and wife, man in plate-armour with head on mantled helm and lion at feet, legs of man missing; effigy of wife in French cap, long cloak,\n\nAlso in the north transept, further west, is a mutilated alabaster effigy of probably Katherine, the 4th daughter of Sir Robert and Elizabeth, and wife of Sir Henry D'Arcy, died 1567, head on two cushions, hands broken, modern altar-tomb with old alabaster plinth, mid- to late-16th-century.\n\nLying loose, close to these monuments, is a broken stone crest. There is also a monument of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt and his wife Elizabeth Oxenbridge in Bigby church, Lincolnshire, dated 1581, which unlike the monument in Leighton church, included effigies of all his twenty-two children.\n\nWorshipful Company of Dyers\n\nIn the Church box a letter was discovered, dated 1947, confirming that the effigies were of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, the first benefactor of the Worshipful Company of Dyers, and that if ever the effigies could be restored, the Dyers Company would be interested to help. A letter was despatched appealing to them for help and telling them of the efforts of this small parish of 220 souls, including all denominations. The Worshipful Company of Dyers very generously offered to relieve the village of its financial burden and pay off the remainder of the money by Deed of Covenant.\n\nThere is engraved graffiti scratching on the tower parapet, R.D. 1641; on doorway of bell-chamber, W.H. R.I. 1666; on wall of second stage, E.S. 1653.\n\nThere are the following monuments: in the chancel, to the Rev. Thomas Ladds, vicar, died 1899; in the nave, to Ernest Cook, died 1917, Wilfred Barwell, died 1918; Lewis Robert Jellis, died 1933; in the south transept, to Hugh Brawn, died 1917; in the tower, floor slab to William Chapman, died 1687.\n\nHerbert's restoration\nRev. George Herbert (1593–1633) was presented with the Prebendary of Leighton in 1626, whilst he was a don at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year that his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and, two miles down the road from Leighton Bromswold, founded the Little Gidding community.\n\nNo religious offices had been said in the church for over twenty years, Izaak Walton wrote - 'so decayed, so little, and so useless, that the parishioners could not meet to perform their duty to God in public prayer and praises'. Although during that time it is recorded that John Barber MA in 1607 and Maurice Hughes MA in 1623 were described as taking up their duties as vicars of St Mary's Leighton Bromswold and it probable at this it is said that the Lord Lennox's barn was used for divine service.\n\nPermission from the Crown had been obtained by the previous incumbent to re-build the church at a cost of £2,000 (approximately £1,000,000 in today's money)\n\nTo raise this money was too daunting so George Herbert asked Nicholas Ferrar to help rebuild the ruined church but Nicholas was fully occupied with his community, so he suggested that his brother, John Ferrar, should supervise the rebuilding whilst Herbert, for his part, should try and raise the money amongst his influential friends. Which he achieved. £50 from William, Earl of Pembroke; £200 from Catherine Clifford, daughter of Lord Clifton of Leighton Bromswold; some money from Lord Manchester and Lord Bolingbroke and also from Henry Herbert, George's brother, Donations, small and great, came from here and there. The actual rebuilding was supervised by John Ferrar, and Arthur Wodenoth, a wealthy gold merchant, who was also a subscriber, acted as Treasurer and during John Ferrar absence as his deputy.\n\nIt is recorded later (by John Ferrar in 1632) that there were 18 masons and labourers and 10 carpenters at work during the reconstruction and that 'all was finished inside and out, not only to ye Parishioners own much comfort and joy, but to the admiration of all men, how such a structure should be raysed and brought to pass by Mr Herbert'.\n\nShortly after 1626 the work was completed by pulling down the north arcade and aisle and building the north wall of the new aisleless nave and the north porch; he re-roofed the whole church and put in the pulpit, reading desk, dwarf screen and seating.\n\nIn 1630, three years before his death, he entered priesthood and took up his duties as rector of the little parish of Fugglestone St Peter with Bemerton St Andrew, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. It is probable that George Herbert never saw the results of his efforts.\n\nPerhaps a fitting epitaph for the faithful of St Mary's and George Herbert are the words written in Izaac Walton's book on Herbert's life (1670). He said: \"Allow that Herbert in the body never looked on Leighton Church, never worshipped God in its aisles; Leighton Church was very dear to Herbert's heart: it was hallowed by his prayers, it was washed by his tears. It is ever to be remembered as incensed by his memory.\"\n\nWalton's Lives 1796\n\nFrom a note to a 1796 edition of Walton's Lives, quoted in H. B. Maling, 'Leighton Bromswold, the Church and Lordship'. \nIt appears from a recent survey of this church, that the reading desk is on the right hand in the nave, just as you enter the chancel, and that is height is seven feet, four inches; and that the pulpit is on the left hand, and exactly of the same height. They are both pentagonal. The church is at present paved with bricks; the roofs bother of the church and chancel tiles, and not under drawn or ceiled. There are no communion rails; but, as you advance to the communion table you ascend three steps. The windows are large and handsome, with some small remnants of painted glass. The seats and pews both in the nave, the cross-aisles, and the chancel, somewhat resemble the stalls in cathedrals, but are very simple, with little or no ornament, nearly alike, and formed of oak. It was evidently the intention of Mr Herbert that in his church there should be no distinction between the seats of the rich and those of the poor. During Divine Service the men have from time immemorial been accustomed to sit on the south side of the Nave, and the women on the north side. In the cross-aisles the male servants sit on the south side, and the female servants on the north side.\n\n1868 survey\n\nIn October 1868 Ewan Christian surveyed the church on behalf of the Commissioners and commented that\nThe interior of the church is well white-washed as to its walls, but being open to the tiles has a bare and barn like look. The tower is blocked off by a gallery, which greatly damages the internal appearance. The nave and transepts still retain the benches of the 17th century, but the wood floors under these are to some extent decayed, and the benches themselves need repair. The chancel was also benched in the same way, but a few years ago the benches were removed into the transepts and large square pews of high deal framing erected in their stead. They are very unsightly and ought to be removed. The pulpit and the desk are also of the 17th century, each of the same height and each has a sounding board over head. The chancel has a plain balustrade rail comparatively modern and both ugly, and wrongly placed.\n\nAs a result, the paving in the chancel was renewed, the square chancel pews being converted into benches with some modern material, (this can clearly be seen in the front westward chancel bench, where the turnings and woodwork are of similar, but different design and texture) and wooden floors modified with some new woodwork into its current configuration and the benches were removed into the transepts. Work was also carried out in the nave and transepts, improving the wooden floors and benches and providing some new ones, also new steps and paving for the passage, restuccoing walls and repairing the old pulpits and desk as well as removing the gallery and opening the tower, restoring old doors and the gate.\n\nThe church was restored in 1870 as a result of Christian's survey. The children's pews at the west end of the nave were installed in 1870 as a result of a request from the vicar Rev. Thomas Ladd at a cost of £18 at which time the font was mounted.\n\nThe original globe electric lights were installed in June 1900 (they were dismantled and are currently stored in the north west of the tower) and replaced in the 1990s by sodium industrial lighting which remains to this day, at the same time the heating system was replaced.\n\nOriginally it was headed by wood burner in the west tower drafting hot air down the centre of the nave where the cast iron grilling can still be seen. Later it was converted to low-wattage oil-filled electric pipe heating under selected benches and finally with medium-wavelength infra-red heaters in the chancel only. Currently there is no heating in the church.\n\nIn 1914 the tie beam in the chancel was cut out and replaced by an iron rod, drawing by Inskipp Ladds, but in 1914 the vicar, Rev. John Cooper, commented that the tie beam is 'a real eyesore disfiguring as it does the east window and hiding the tracery.' An additional tie beam was added across the east face of the west tower.\n\nModern upkeep\n\nIn 1961 the Ely Diocesan Board asked for a quinquennial inspection report to be prepared by John Gedge, architect. This was presented to the parochial church council, and the estimated cost was £8,000. The architect, stressing that such a large amount from such a small parish would be impossible to raise, suggested the more important items of roof and gutters should have top priority.\n\nOne member of the parochial church council wrote to the Church Commissioners asking if St Mary's, Leighton Bromswold had a lay rector. To this query, came answer that they held this office and were solely responsible for the repair and upkeep of the chancel. This part of the restoration was carried out for the Church Commissioners by John Allen & Co., Brampton at the figure of £5,500. The architect, Major Gedge, set the target figure of £3,000 to cover the remainder of the work on the restoration of the church.\n\nThe Leighton Village Fund for Church Restoration was opened in 1962. On 28 July 1962 a barbecue dance was staged in the village field and a fete down the village street added another £358. The following year, 1963, another barbecue dance, in a barn and another fete added a further £225 and in 1964 another £199 was made from a fete. Altogether, with donations and other efforts, a total of £901 was made.\n\nThe Historic Churches Preservation Trust donated £500, Church Commissioners gave £50. The two Restoration Appeal Funds were closed in September 1964 having reached the target of £3,000.\n\nDuring the winter of 1964, a farmer sent his men and they removed from the churchyard an estimated 100 tons of soil so that the level of the ground outside the church is at least 6 inches lower than the floor inside. A 24-inch-wide trench,  to 2 feet deep, was dug all round the church and was refilled with 95 tons of gravel to assist drainage and prevent damp rising in the church. The old drainage system was exposed and renewed where necessary. The gravel was given and carted from Thrapston by the farmer and also red bank drainage tiles.\n\nOn 3 June 1965, the Bishop of Ely, lead a thanksgiving service to commemorate the completion of the work with the Choir of St John's, Cambridge and the Ely Diocesan Bellringers. It was televised by BBC TV.\n\nLych gate\n\nThe lych gate was built in 1893. It was dedicated to the memory of George Smith, sometime churchwarden and buried in the churchyard, by his widow, Margaret in 1909.\n\nClock\n\nOriginally, a provision was made on all four sides of Leighton church tower for square clock faces set lozenge-style, recalling similar clocks on the St Gregory Tower at St Paul's and the western turret at Covent Garden (neither of which are still in existence). There are additional similarities in the design of the west tower to these two churches, in particular the parallel windows of the ringing chamber, though there is no evidence to suggest that there was any formal connection. However, as built, the west tower has a single clock face on the west face of the tower.\n\nIn 1977 the church clock winding system was electrified at a cost of £365. This was to save someone climbing up narrow winding stone steps to the Clock Tower floor and winding up two sets of mechanisms, striking and timing, 5 times in fourteen days. The necessary wiring was installed in May 1976 enabling the work to commence.\n\nFor the clock, the work consisted of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. For the strike, the installation consisted of a RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the internal dial re-lacquered. The work was carried out by the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric motor clamped to weights and geared with sprockets onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.\n\nChantry\n\nThere was a chantry at Leighton Bromswold apparently in the church, which was founded by Master Gilbert Smith, Archdeacon of Northampton, and endowed with a pension payable by St Andrew's Priory, Northampton.\n\nThe church's gatehouse was built in the 15th century and is the only part of a mansion designed by John Thorpe for the Duke of Lennox that was actually completed.\n\nNotable residents\nNicholas Grimald (1519–1562), the poet, was supposed to have been born in Leighton Bromswold.\n\nThe Spanish Armada Muster Call of Captain Wanton's men happened on 2 August 1588; those mustered included two pikemen, Richard Clarke and Nick Colton, both from Leighton Bromswold.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The parish of Leighton Bromswold\n\nVillages in Cambridgeshire\nCivil parishes in Cambridgeshire\nHuntingdonshire", "machine_abstract": "Bromsgrove, Worcestershire Genealogy Society.\nLeighton Bromswold (1760–1840) was the son of Sir Henry and Lady Elizabeth Bromswold.

{"id": "Absalon-class frigate", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absalon-class%20frigate", "title": "Absalon-class frigate", "text": "The Absalon class are frigates of the Royal Danish Navy, commissioned in 2005. The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.\n\nDesign\nThe class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.\n\nThe ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.\n\nThe ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.\n\nThe design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.\n\nThe hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out \"in-house\" by the RDN and DALO.\n\nThe standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.\n\nHistory\nThe ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.\n\nProduction started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.\n\nAmong other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.\n\nFor political reasons, the ships were originally launched as \"Flexible support ships\" to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes. This upgrade is expected to complete in 2026.\n\nList of ships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Danish Naval History\n Admiral Danish Fleet Headquarters\n Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization\n HDMS Absalon Command and Support Ship - Flexible Support Ship\n Naval Technology\n\nAmphibious warfare vessel classes\n \n \nShips of the Royal Danish Navy\n2004 ships\nFrigate classes", "machine_abstract": "The Absalon class is the first of two classes of stealth corvettes ordered by Denmark in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Such a solution is formed by random mixing of components of similar molar volume and without strong specific interactions, and its behavior diverges from that of an ideal solution by showing phase separation at intermediate compositions and temperatures (a miscibility gap). Its entropy of mixing is equal to that of an ideal solution with the same composition, due to random mixing without strong specific interactions. For two components \n\nwhere  is the gas constant,  the total number of moles, and  the mole fraction of each component. Only the enthalpy of mixing is non-zero, unlike for an ideal solution, while the volume of the solution equals the sum of volumes of components.\n\nFeatures \nA regular solution can also be described by Raoult's law modified with a Margules function with only one parameter :\n\nwhere the Margules function is\n\nNotice that the Margules function for each component contains the mole fraction of the other component. It can also be shown using the Gibbs-Duhem relation that if the first Margules expression holds, then the other one must have the same shape. A regular solutions internal energy will vary during mixing or during process.\n\nThe value of  can be interpreted as W/RT, where W = 2U12 - U11 - U22 represents the difference in interaction energy between like and unlike neighbors.\n\nIn contrast to ideal solutions, regular solutions do possess a non-zero enthalpy of mixing, due to the W term. If the unlike interactions are more unfavorable than the like ones, we get competition between an entropy of mixing term that produces a minimum in the Gibbs free energy at x1 = 0.5 and the enthalpy term that has a maximum there. At high temperatures, the entropic term in the free energy of mixing dominates and the system is fully miscible, but at lower temperatures the G(x1) curve will have two minima and a maximum in between. This results in phase separation. In general there will be a temperature where the three extremes coalesce and the system becomes fully miscible.

In particular, it provides an argument for the uncertainty principle on the basis of the principles of classical optics. \n\nThe concept was criticized by Heisenberg's mentor Niels Bohr, and theoretical and experimental developments have suggested that Heisenberg's intuitive explanation of his mathematical result might be misleading. While the act of measurement does lead to uncertainty, the loss of precision is less than that predicted by Heisenberg's argument when measured at the level of an individual state. The formal mathematical result remains valid, however, and the original intuitive argument has also been vindicated mathematically when the notion of disturbance is expanded to be independent of any specific state.\n\nHeisenberg's argument\n\nHeisenberg supposes that an electron is like a classical particle, moving in the  direction along a line below the microscope. Let the cone of light rays leaving the microscope lens and focusing on the electron make an angle   with the electron. Let  be the wavelength of the light rays. Then, according to the laws of classical optics, the microscope can only resolve the position of the electron up to an accuracy of\n\nAn observer perceives an image of the particle because the light rays strike the particle and bounce back through the microscope to the observer's eye. We know from experimental evidence that when a photon strikes an electron, the latter has a Compton recoil with momentum proportional to , where  is Planck's constant. However, the extent of \"recoil cannot be exactly known, since the direction of the scattered photon is undetermined within the bundle of rays entering the microscope.\" In particular, the electron's momentum in the  direction is only determined up to\n\nCombining the relations for  and , we thus have\n\n,\n\nwhich is an approximate expression of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nAnalysis of argument\n\nAlthough the thought experiment was formulated as an introduction to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, one of the pillars of modern physics, it attacks the very premises under which it was constructed, thereby contributing to the development of an area of physics—namely, quantum mechanics—that redefined the terms under which the original thought experiment was conceived. \n\nQuantum mechanics questions whether an electron actually has a determinate position before it is disturbed by the measurement used to establish said determinate position. Under a more thorough quantum mechanical analysis, an electron has some probability of showing up at any point in the universe, though the probability that it will be far from where one  expects becomes very low at great distances from the neighborhood in which it is originally found. In other words, the \"position\" of an electron can only be stated in terms of a probability distribution, as can predictions of where it may move.\n\nSee also\n Atom localization\n Quantum mechanics\n Basics of quantum mechanics\n Interpretation of quantum mechanics\n Philosophical interpretation of classical physics\n Schrödinger's cat\n Uncertainty principle\n Quantum field theory\n Electromagnetic radiation\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\nHistory of Heisenberg's Microscope\nLectures on Heisenberg's Microscope\n\nThought experiments in quantum mechanics\nWerner Heisenberg", "machine_abstract": "In 1927, the German physicist Werner Heisenberg published his uncertainty principle in physics which states that it is impossible to measure both position and momentum of particles simultaneously because they are complementary variables.\nThe concept was later used by Richard Feynman as part of his explanation on how quantum mechanics works at atomic level using diagrams known today as Feynman diagrams or Feynman graphs (see also Feynman's path integral formulation).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Heisenberg's microscope\".
